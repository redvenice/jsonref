The weekly incidence rate reached 584.4 new infections per 100,000 people over seven days, the agency added. The number is a significant jump on yesterday’s daily rise of 74,405 and 193 deaths and on case numbers recorded at the end of the last week. It is the highest recorded daily figure since the pandemic began. Germany now joins other European countries like the UK, France and Italy in recording more than 100,000 new Covid-19 infections on one day. The country recently tightened restrictions on access to restaurants, bars and cafes to people who have received their booster jabs or who are tested on top of being fully vaccinated or recovered. Germany has also pledged to accelerate vaccinations while the parliament prepares to discuss introducing mandatory vaccinations - a measure supported by new chancellor Olaf Scholz.Poland reported more than 30,000 daily cases today for the first time since April, intensifying debate over whether stricter restrictions on public life are needed. “If these trends continue, next week the number of infections could exceed the level of 50,000 per day,” Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. Reuters report he urged private employers to follow the state sector in requiring people to work from home whenever possible.Marki-Zay said on his official Facebook page that he had mild symptoms resembling a cold, and had received three Covid-19 shots so was hoping to get back on the campaign road in five days if he has a negative test then.

The objective is to keep dogs separate from areas used by bathers during bathing seasons, for health and safety reasons, Mr Diamond said.“This criterion is imperative in all regions where blue flag is operated. The rationale for restricting access of domesticated animals to beaches is that among the most common hazards in bathing waters are microbial pathogens introduced by faecal contamination from humans and animals,” he said.Meanwhile, some politicians in Kerry have said horses will also be banned from Kerry beaches apart from early morning and late evening.‘Nanny state’If the rules are not adopted, Kerry will lose some of its blue flag awards, director of Kerry’s services for beaches and water John Breen said.Promenades and car parks outside the beaches will not be affected.There has been strong reaction and Fianna Fail councillor Johnny Wall, former mayor of Tralee, who was co-opted onto the council seat vacated by Minister for Education Norma Foley when she was elected to the Dáil, said he could not support the proposal.Fianna Fail’s Mikey Sheehy said it had the hallmarks of the “nanny state” .Independent councillor Jackie Healy-Rae, a dog owner, said he feared for the tourism economy.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe nightmare before Christmas never really happened. When the Omicron variant of the Sars Cov-2 virus was first detected in South Africa at the end of November, the alarm bells started ringing loudly across the world.The virus had mutated so dramatically in such a short space of time that there were fears it would undo all the positive benefits of the vaccine programme in Ireland and other countries.As the weeks passed, it became clear the virus was indeed infecting those who were already vaccinated and was far more transmissible than any of the variants that preceded it.But there was good news too. Early data from Africa and other countries suggested that people were not getting as sick with Omicron as they had done with Delta or the early strains of the infection.Scientists and medics urged caution, however. It was still too early to say how severe the impact of Omicron would be in this part of the world.But it now seems clear that Omicron has worked in our favour – at least to some degree.Tens of thousands of people were diagnosed with the illness every day at the height of the fifth wave of the pandemic in Ireland but while the numbers in hospitals climbed to in excess of 1,000, those who fell critically ill and ended up in ICU rarely went above 100.Now the case numbers are falling and it looks like the peak of the current wave has come and gone.Much of the talk today is about when and how Ireland will reopen, what Nphet will advise later this week and what the country will look like once the shadow of the pandemic eventually lifts.Today In The News talks to  Public Affairs Editor Simon Carswell and Prof Christine Loescher of DCU about how and when Ireland might re-open and the likely trajectory of the illness in the weeks ahead.In the News is presented by reporters Sorcha Pollak and Conor Pope.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"how the pandemic exposed the myth of the anglosphere","story":"A park bench in Brockwell Park, London, that was taped off to stop people sitting on it in the early days of the pandemic in April 2020. Photograph: Richard BakerIn Pictures via Getty ImagesYes, he might lose his job, US-resident Brits are currently having to explain to neighbours, friends and Uber drivers. Yes, the prime minister of the actual UK. Yes, over some office parties of less than Caligula-grade decadence.The bemusement of our hosts is not evidence of their slacker ethical standards. Rather, the problem is that Americans tend to underrate how harsh the UK’s lockdown was for much of 2020 – and how correspondingly provocative Boris Johnson’s breaches of it are.In turn, both countries struggle to believe the severity of the restrictions under which Australians have lived. A bid for “Covid zero” made the place all but unvisitable at times, even for passport-holding expats. Melbourne had no fewer than six lockdowns. Unable to renew his near-monopoly on that city’s Grand Slam tennis tournament, Novak Djokovic can attest to the strength of feeling there.All of which gives rise to a question. If there is such a thing as an “Anglosphere”, bound by a deep-seated culture of inidualism, why did the member nations erge so much over the pandemic? Aukus, a naval pact agreed between the three countries mentioned above last September, breathed new life into the idea of English-speaking unity.But the past two years have more often argued against it. The gamut of pandemic measures runs from the relative laxity of the US to, in the case of Australasia, perhaps the severest lockdowns in the western world. Some local authorities in Britain were taping up park benches to prevent strangers sharing them. Try doing that in Dallas or Miami. To the extent that Covid has served as an audit of national cultures, the findings refute the idea of a Washington-to-Wellington communion of values.For the US, with a $21 trillion economy and no express need for the outside world, this is an academic point. But for a midsized nation that has spurned its own continental market, on the hunch that its English-speaking former colonies can step in, the tenuousness of any Anglosphere is more troubling. It implies that national interests still trump (for want of a less loaded verb) ancestral fealties.Steel tariffsTellingly, the US still has steel tariffs on the UK, but not on the EU. Washington’s trade representative Katherine Tai is “confident that we will take this up when the time is right”. It is not known whether she was ruffling Johnson’s hair and praising the quaintness of Regency costume dramas while uttering those words.I spent long enough in Westminster to anticipate the Conservative response here. That is, a Republican administration would have been more generous to the UK. And so we have the paradox of the “special relationship”: it is at once fundamental and entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House.If any good comes of the past two years, it will be a sense of realism in Britain and elsewhere about the US. It is not, as even the French presume, an “Anglo-Saxon” country, whatever that means. It does not share political culture or institutions with the white Commonwealth. First, it broke from colonial rule much earlier and more absolutely than Australia, Canada or New Zealand, none of which are republics. Second, it absorbed such vast and such varied immigration as to become its own category of nation.Whether the events of 1776 constitute a “revolution” (Gore Vidal, noting that the domestic social order was not turned upside down, preferred the term “separation”), they ingrained a mistrust of the state. The consequences are evident in good ways and bad.“A Latin-Slav mixture”, one UK premier called America, and that was in the 1950s. In other words, even if you are a crude ethnic determinist, it makes no sense to assume an automatic coincidence of world views between the US and other countries that happen to speak English. It makes even less to bet your nation’s economic future on it. And given that the US accounts for the lion’s share of the population and economic output of the Anglosphere, that putative grouping has no meaning without it.AmbivalenceThe uniqueness of the US is recorded here with due ambivalence. On the one side, American inidualism prevented the most heavy-handed pandemic measures. It is increasingly plausible that the taped-up benches and Zoom-only funerals had a scarring effect that Britain and other nations will be reckoning with for years.On the other side, there is a pandemic death toll that now well exceeds that of the American Civil War.

He’s the leader of the pack.”Five works - all currently owned by one American collector - are set to go on sale in London, with the auction, including an 1897 depiction of chrysanthemums, projected to achieve £10 million to £15 million, and an 1894 image of grainstacks near his Monet’s Giverny home, also estimated to achieve between £10 million and £15 million.Also going under the hammer are an 1893 painting of an ice flow on the Seine valued between £5 million and £7 million, an 1897 landscape of the Norman coast expected to achieve between 3.5 million and £5 million, and an 1882 still life of plums and apricots worth up to £1.8 million.The sale, predicted to attract interest from buyers based in countries including China and Japan, follows the success of other Impressionist sales, including a 2017 auction which saw Asian collectors secure Monet’s Les Arceaux de roses for £14 million, and his study of lake ice for £19.5 million.The evening auction is set to take place on March 2.More from NewsPolitics latest news: More \u0026#39Red Wall\u0026#39 Tory MPs submit letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson in \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39What are the Covid Plan B restrictions?Covid latest news: End of Plan B restrictions expected to be announced by Boris JohnsonTrafficking ringleader sentenced to 15 years in prison over 39 migrants found dead in lorryMinister accuses Prince Andrew of keeping \u0026#39horrifically ill-advised\u0026#39 companyPork-pie plotters could inflict long-term damage on the Tory Party if they oust Boris nowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"economic storm clouds gathering","story":"Amid his many travails, Boris Johnson must hope that a few more days will see the “partygate” furore subside, assuming the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray provides the wriggle room to escape. But it will be but a temporary reprieve before the economic storm clouds start to gather in the spring.Arguably, they are already here. An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that, for the third time since the financial crash of 2008, real wages are falling once more and began to do so way back in June.With inflation expected to hit 6 per cent as taxes go up and energy bills double, the painful impact on household budgets is easy to foresee. Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election. As yet there is little sign of it.More from NewsPolitics latest news: More \u0026#39Red Wall\u0026#39 Tory MPs submit letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson in \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39What are the Covid Plan B restrictions?Covid latest news: End of Plan B restrictions expected to be announced by Boris JohnsonTrafficking ringleader sentenced to 15 years in prison over 39 migrants found dead in lorryMinister accuses Prince Andrew of keeping \u0026#39horrifically ill-advised\u0026#39 companyPork-pie plotters could inflict long-term damage on the Tory Party if they oust Boris nowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt veterans share experiences serving ban gay troops","story":"The Government has launched a review into the experience of LGBT veterans who served during a ban on gay troops in order to learn from their experiences.The independent review, part of the Veterans\u0027 Strategy Action Plan, will seek to understand how the pre-2000 ban impacted gay personnel in the military.The Government said it would provide an opportunity for it to better understand the lived experience of LGBT veterans who served prior to 2000, including how being discharged from the military because of their sexuality affected their lives.It is understood there will be a call for evidence so that anyone with relevant experience comes forward.

rollout","story":"Nearly 150,000 rural homes are at risk of being “left behind” in the Government’s broadband rollout because it is too expensive to reach them with cables, MPs have warned.The Commons public accounts committee said that ministers appeared to have “no clear plan” for getting connections to the remotest communities, where installing conventional broadband is not financially viable for private companies.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which is heading up the rollout, has previously said it is looking at emerging technologies, such as satellites that can beam internet coverage to remote areas.However, MPs warned ministers have not yet produced any details for how such a policy would work in practice.In a report by the committee released on Wednesday, MPs said that without a plan and funding from the Government, broadband companies were likely to miss out on these hard-to-reach areas because of the “prohibitively high cost” of connecting them.The report said: “Accelerating coverage through rollout by commercial operators, rather than by prioritising those areas it knows are hardest to reach, risks some of the areas that need improved connectivity most, being once again left behind.”The concerns come over the Government’s scheme to introduce gigabit broadband, capable of reaching speeds of 1,000 mbps (megabits per second), across the UK.Boris Johnson initially pledged to spend £5 billion so that 100 per cent of the country would have access to such a connection by 2025.However, the Government has since watered down that target, saying it is now aiming to hit 85 per cent of the country in three years with full coverage by 2030.MPs said they were “not convinced” ministers would even meet the reduced target by 2025 due to emerging delays in the contracts it is negotiating with broadband providers.Dame Meg Hillier, the chairman of the public accounts committee, said: “DCMS’ planning and project management here show all the signs of the previous rollout – that the focus will continue to be on the easier to reach areas and there is still no clear plan for the hardest to reach communities.”DCMS could not really explain how broadband has got as far as it has in this critical national strategy, beyond “thanks to Virgin Media”, and it still does not have a real plan for getting the rest of the way to its own downgraded targets.“What DCMS does know full well is it can’t rely on the private sector to get fast broadband to the hardest to reach, excluded and rural areas, and despite its repeated promises to do exactly that we are apparently little nearer to closing ‘the great digital ide’ developing across the UK nor addressing the social and economic inequality it brings with it.”Following the report, a spokesman for DCMS said:  It is misleading to suggest we are reliant on the commercial sector to hit our target which we remain on track to meet.We are investing £5 billion so hard-to-reach areas can get gigabit speeds, have already upgraded 600,000 premises, and in three years national coverage has rocketed from six per cent to 65 per cent.Our policies and investment also mean 97 per cent of premises can access superfast broadband which meets people\u0027s current needs and helped us through the pandemic.More from NewsCovid latest news: End of Plan B restrictions expected to be announced

Work-from-home guidance and Covid passes for nightclubs are expected to go on January , though reports suggest face mask rules on shops and public transport will stay. Face masks in school, travel tests on arrival to the UK and daily contact tests could all also be eased. Boris Johnson is meeting his Cabinet to discuss the measures this morning and will make an announcement to Parliament at lunchtime.Health Secretary Sajid Javid earlier said he is cautiously optimistic that the Government can substantially reduce Covid restrictions next week - while No hinted an announcement is due within days. He told MPs it’s likely we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations as ministers prepare to review Plan B measures next Wednesday. Mr Javid is the third minister in a week to sound hopeful about lting Plan B measures.  New positive Covid cases have fallen % in a week with , recorded yesterday, and hospital admissions have plateaued. But deaths are still up % in a week to , and , people were admitted to hospital with Covid yesterday alone.Sajid Javid told the Commons: The action that this Government has taken in response to Omicron and the collective efforts of the British people have seen us become the most boosted country in Europe, the most tested country in Europe, andthe most antivirals per head in Europe.That is why we are the most open country in Europe. I have always said that these restrictions should not stay in place a day longer than absolutely necessary. Due to these pharmaceutical defences and the likelihood that we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations, I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to substantially reduce restrictions next week. Here are all the changes that could happen, or have happened already: Working from home guidance Since December  people have been urged to “work from homeyou can” in England. This guidance, which is not legally binding, is a key way of getting cases down - but the government says it has “immediate costs to the economy”. Tory ministers have repeatedly emphasised how much worth they place on going into offices in person. As such, it is a key measure the Prime Minister will want to get rid of when England’s Plan B rules are reviewed.  Covid vaccine passes at nightclubs and big sports Since December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England have had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. But the law that enforces Covid ‘passports’ expires at .pm on Wednesday  January. Boris Johnson would likely need to put any extension to a vote - and last time around  Tory MPs rebelled.The Prime Minister is already battling for survival over Downing Street parties, and another huge revolt could be fatal. Mr Johnson had suggested the definition of ‘vaccinated’ for a Covid pass would be updated from two to three doses. This has already happened in Scotland as of January  - but it will not necessarily be the same in England. Officials are still waiting for many people who caught Covid in December to get a booster, as being infected triggers a -day ban on getting jabbed. But face masks in shops and on trains might stay Face masks were made compulsory in England in two waves through winter, first on public transport, then in shops. They are also mandatory in shopping malls, taxis, banks, post offices, hair salons, barbers, nail salons, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, takeaways , estate agents. But these face mask laws came before Plan B, and reports have suggested they could outlast it too. Sunday newspapers have claimed some face mask restrictions could be extended beyond January .  Masks in schools axed Englandaposs secondary schools have told students to wear face masks in the classroom since January . But reports suggest this rule will be axed around the time Plan B is eased on January  - or even before that date, as it’s not formally part of Plan B. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday: “I don’t want to see masks in the classroom for a day longer than is necessary. “And on January  we’ll review that and I hope we’ll be able to take it away.” Travel testing axed for the vaccinated Vaccinated travellers will soon be allowed toto the UK without taking a Covid test at all,a change gets the go-ahead. Currently vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test within two days of ing to Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven.But it’s understood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is looking at removing this last UK test requirement for vaccinated travellers by the end of January.If so, it is likely to coincide with the review of the plan B measures on January . Unjabbed travellers would still need to take UK arrival tests - and of course, British tourists may still have to take tests when heading abroad, depending on which country they go to. Daily testing for Covid contacts cut The self-isolation period for people with Covid was shortened this weekto at least five full days in England. Butyou’re a contact of someone with Covid, the rules haven’t changed yet - you don’t need to isolate, but you do need to take a daily lateral flow test for seven days. When isolation changes were announced last week, the government said it would review this guidance - hinting it could be cut to five days too.The government said it would “consider the guidance for close contacts of people with COVID-, including around the advice for fully vaccinated contacts to take daily LFDs for  days.”So far no change has been announced. … And the changes already confirmed Covid isolation cut to five full days in England The Covid isolation period in England has been cut to five full days since January .Previously people who tested positive for Covid could be freed midway through their seventh full day of isolation,they test negative on days six and seven. That period has been cut by between  and  hours, after huge pressure from Tory MPs and a staffing crisis in the NHS.Under the new rules, people in England with Covid must isolate for at least five full days. They will then be able to leave isolation at the start of the sixth full day -they have tested negative for Covid on both Day  and Day .Your first full day of isolation starts at .am, the calendar day after you test positive or show symptoms. Soyou test positive at am, aposDay apos starts  hours later.This means the new total isolation time is, in reality, somewhere between five and six days depending on what time you went into isolation. UK Health Security Agency data shows around two thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by the end of Day . This rises to %people have two negative lateral flow tests,  hours apart. In Scotland and Wales, the isolation period is still seven days . Booster vaccines for - and -year-olds All eligible - and -year-olds are able to book a Covid booster jab from January .Previously, boosters were only recommended for clinically vulnerable  and -year-olds who are most at risk from Covid-. But recent data from the UKHSA showed two doses were not enough to stop people becoming unwell from Omicron.More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, so will be eligible for a booster. However, not all are eligible now, as they still have to wait until three months since their second dose. About , teenagers are newly eligible now, and many of the rest should become eligible in the coming weeks. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Scotland Scotlandaposs limit on football matches and other outdoor events has been scrapped from January .Football matches and other outdoor events in Scotland were limited to only  people from December , meaning Boxing Day games were effectively fan free and Hogmanay festivities were axed.That -person limit has now been axed - followed by all other Omicron restrictions in Scotland from next week. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Wales Covid restrictions in Wales are being eased over the next two weeks, the Welsh Government has confirmed. Since Saturday, as many as  people have been able to attend outdoor event activities - rising from . And from this Friday  January there will be no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities. Nightclubs could reopen from January , which is when alert level  restrictions will come in to force for indoor restrictions.

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

The senior civil servant is said to believe that for her inquiry to be seen as credible she has to speak to all key witnesses. While it is not yet clear whether she has already been in touch with the PMaposs former closest aide, she plans to be before publishing her findings into Downing Street gatherings. One source said: Sue wants the inquiry to be as robust as possible. Cummings is going to be interviewed by the time the inquiry concludes. It would be extraordinarywe went through the whole thing and no attempt was made to interview him.In explosive claims, Mr Cummings had said that the PM had waved aside concerns about the rule-busting gathering which then went ahead.  He claimed that he and other eyewitnesses would be willing to swear under oath that senior officials had warned the event was against the rules.Mr Johnson sparked widespread disbelief last week at PMQs when he apologised for the gathering but claimed he implicitly believed it was work related.The under-fire PM broke cover for the first time in days on Tuesday to insist that he hadnapost lied to Parliament. In his clip to broadcasters, Mr Johnson confirmed that he had also been interviewed by Ms Gray. I do humbly apologise to people for misjudgments that were made, he said. But that is the very, very best of my recollection about this event. Thataposs what Iaposve said to the inquiry.  Mr Johnson claimed that nobody told me that the boozy lockdown bash in the No  garden broke Covid rules. Downing Street has fiercely denied the claims, backed up by several senior journalists, that two officials told the PM the event was “a party” before it happened.Deputy PM Dominic Raab said on Tuesday that Mr Johnson would normally be expected to resignhe had intentionally misled Parliament. But he dismissed the claim by Mr Cummings, who has become the PMaposs fiercest critic, that the PM had lied to the Commons as nonsense. However, Mr Raab described the event as a party before rapidly backtracking. Many Tory MPs are believed to be waiting for the result of Ms Grayaposs inquiry, which could be pushed back until next week, before deciding whether to trigger a confidence vote in the PM. Exactly  letters need to be submitted, with reports suggesting that around half that number are already in.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public. So decent people everywhere will wish the Prince of Wales well in his quest to improve the painfully strained relations with his son. If anyone has a chance of building bridges with Prince Harry, it’s his father.

As many as  of the  intake of Tories reportedly plan to submit letters of no confidence in the PM tomorrow. One Tory said: “His time has gone.” And the partygate probe is to quiz Dominic Cummings who alleges Mr Johnson lied to Parliament.Angry Red Wall Tories are plotting the PMaposs downfall over the partygate scandal.The Mirror understands that more than  Tory MPs who were elected at the  election met at Westminster to conspire over the Prime Ministeraposs future. With the Tories teetering on the brink of civil war, one frustrated minister dubbed it the apospork pie plotapos as the MP for Melton was alleged to have been one of those involved. Another rattled Cabinet minister branded the Red Wall MPs a load of fu***ng nobodies in comments set to hammer relations still further.  One Tory MP was quoted as saying: “His time has gone.” Another said: “I think we’ve done it... The whips operation completely backfired. Colleagues now have a sense they aren’t alone.”In another blow for the PM, the Mirror learned that Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray will interview Dominic Cummings before presenting her findings into Downing Street parties.A Government source said: Sue wants the inquiry to be as robust as possible. He is going to be interviewed by the time the inquiry concludes.Mr Johnson has been accused of lying to the House of Commons by claiming he thought that a bring your own booze garden party on May ,  was a work event.In explosive claims, Mr Cummings had claimed the PM waved aside concerns about the rule-busting gathering at the height of lockdown. He claimed that he and other eyewitnesses would be willing to swear under oath that senior officials had warned the event was against the rules.  In a deeply uncomfortable broadcast interview, Mr Johnson claimed that nobody told me the No  garden party was against the rules. This was even though his own Government drew up the rules which millions of other Brits had followed at the time. The PM, looking pale and drawn on a visit to a North London hospital, repeatedly refused to rule out resigninghe was found to have misled Parliament. Well, letaposs see what the report says, he said.Mr Johnson sparked widespread disbelief last week at PMQs when he apologised for the gathering but claimed he implicitly believed it was work related. Downing Street has fiercely denied claims by multiple senior journalists that two officials told Mr Johnson the event was “a party” before it happened. Dominic Raab claimed that Mr Johnson would normally be expected to resignhe intentionally misled Parliament.The deputy PM then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Sky News presenter Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”  Rishi Sunak, tipped as Mr Johnsonaposs most likely successor, gave a lukewarm show of support for the beleaguered PM.The Chancellor said of course he believed Mr Johnsonaposs account to Parliament but refused to give him his full backing, abruptly leaving the interview after being grilled over whether he had lied.Downing Street has launched aposOperation Red Meatapos, a slew of policy announcements designed to appeal to the Tory base, including on migrant crossings and BBC funding.In another attempt to appease disgruntled Tory MPs, the Government will tomorrow set out plans to relax the remaining Covid restrictions in England. The PM is also claimed to have triggered aposOperation Big Dogapos to save himself by sacking several senior aides. Mr Johnson confirmed that he had also been interviewed by Ms Gray.  I do humbly apologise to people for misjudgments that were made, he said. But that is the very, very best of my recollection about this event. Thataposs what Iaposve said to the inquiry. He publicly apologised to the Queen over claims of two separate parties in No  the night before Prince Phillipaposs funeral, where the monarch was forced to sit grieving alone. I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made, and for which I take full responsibility, he said. Many Tory MPs are waiting for the result of Ms Grayaposs inquiry, which could be pushed back until next week, before deciding whether to trigger a confidence vote in the PM. Exactly  letters need to be submitted, with reports suggesting that around half that number had already been reached. Bury South MP Christian Wakeford became the seventh Tory to stick his head above the parapet and publicly confirm he had submitted his letter. Ominously for the PM, he warned that some of his Red Wall colleagues “have written the letters but haven’t sent them in yet”. Several Tories suggested they would rather wait until the May local elections - in which the party could be hammered - to get rid of the PM. One furious Tory told the Mirror: It’s not Operation Big Dog, it’s Operation Massive C**k. I don’t know where it goes from here.  We are grinding slowly to , butwe get  he will win the no confidence vote and notionally we can’t do it for another year. If there is a leadership contest, Sunak will win easily - but the party will fight like ferrets in a sack. Another Tory MP from an earlier intake said the mood against Mr Johnson was calming down among more experienced MPs and ministers. The MP added: But itaposs not among newer cohorts. Thereaposs a huge generational ide here as there was during the Owen Paterson affair. It will be the newer MPs who bring down the PM. I have never seen anything like it.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided. History will be justiably unkind to a truly terrible leader.

Yulia Minina, who lives in the small town of Stary Oskol, bought gorgeous cat Kefir almost two years ago as a tiny kitten. The Maine Coon, who is named after the dairy drink because of his stunning silky white coat, is often mistaken for a dog because heaposs so enormous, Yulia claims. He weighs .kgand is likely to become even heavier - as Maine Coons tend to grow until theyaposre three of four years old. Yulia said: I could not even think that an ordinary baby can become so big.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here He not only grew up big in appearance, he is also very smart and always behaves calmly. The look is generally like that of a person, and Kefir has a formidable appearance, but he is a very affectionate and modest child. When friends and acquaintances come to the house - all the attention is on him and he willingly allows himself to be stroked. However, when strangers who have never seen Kefir before come to the house, theyaposre confused by the regal creature greeting them at the door. aposaposBut when strangers come to the house, everyone first confuses him with a dog, Yulia said. “He has one more habit: at night he likes to climb on me and sleep. When he was a kitten, it didn’t cause me any inconvenience. aposaposBut now he has become big and heavy, and, of course, it is dficult to sleep like that. At one year and  months old, it seems Kefir will be disturbing Yuliaaposs sleep for years to come. Photos of Yulia carrying her big baby show how enormous he is, almost dwarfing his owner with his huge frame and bottle brush tail. Some people arenapost sureKefir is truly as big as he seems in photos, but Yulia insists: I donapost use Photoshop.

The decision was taken at Range High School in Formby to remove the doors over the Christmas half-term over what has been called anti-social behaviour, reported the Liverpool Echo.But no changes have been made to the girlsapos toilets where the doors remain. One Year  pupil at the school said that he doesnapost like the way people can now hear them using the toilet from outside. He said: People donapost feel comfortable using the toilets.  There are cubicles, but the urinals are behind a screen and you can see into the room and hear people using the toilets. Itaposs just created tension in the school.

You will get a dferent answer depending on who you ask. One said because of anti-social behaviour, another said to improve ventilation. Tom Dolly, deputy headteacher at Range High School, told the Liverpool Echo that it was decided to remove the doors due to anti-social behaviour, and he denied that the boysapos privacy is affected. He said: Following some anti-social behaviour in certain boysapos toilets, the school has refurbished and upgraded some of the facilities as part of an ongoing improvement agenda and as requested by the school student council. No oneaposs privacy is compromised in any way following the installation of new privacy ling in the two toilets where doors have been removed.

Writing in the British Medical Journal, their study claims that the rapid kits were not as effective in youngsters and students, even as all secondary school students in Britain are encouraged to use them twice weekly. Their findings said that the tests only detected  per cent of Covid positive children. When the children had symptoms of Covid, like a cough or change or loss to the sense of taste and smell, detection rates increased to  per cent.  This means only little over half the youngsters who had the virus were caught. The authors said their findings meant that lateral flow tests would fail to meet the minimum standards of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the US’ Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation. These three bodies all require Covid testing kits to meet a minimum of around an  per cent success rate.  The study only included samples taken by professionally trained iniduals and not self testing at home.This comes as Omicron cases continue to fall, day-on-day, amidst hopes the fourth waves has peaked.One of the authors, Dr Naomi Fujita-Rohwerder, of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care in Cologne, Germany, said: “Taking into account test-specic pooled results, no test included in this review fully satisfied the minimum performance requirements as recommended by WHO...the US…or the MHRA in the UK.  “This may affect the planned purpose of the broad implementation of testing programmes.” The report only examined studies that used eight dferent lateral flow kits, so some of the + tests available globally may be more accurate. All of the studie looked at in the new analysis were published between the start of  and May  meaning they will not have contained the Omicron iant.  The researchers did not offer any reasons why the tests had performed less accurately on children, or a comparative study in adults. Regular and freely available lateral flow tests are a key part of the UK’s response to Covid and containing it.

Professor Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , told Times Radio it doesnapost do the virus any good to increase in severity, though new iants may prove to be even more transmissible than Omicron.He said that any new iant would need to out-compete Omicron through increased transmissibility or escape from immunity, and not through changes in severity.Covid has so far killed over , British people.It doesnapost do the virus any good to become increasingly severe, he said. In fact, it looks like the Omicron iant, by becoming more transmissible, that itaposs also become less severe, and we would hope thataposs the general direction of travel. He said that in future not everyone would need booster vaccines, adding: I think the people that we might want to think about boosting the most are the same as flu really - people with chronic illness and elderly people - and weaposll probably move into a sort of more regular annual vaccination programme, or it may not even need to be that frequent.  We need to wait for the evidence on that. Prof Hayward said he agreed the pandemic will end and people will live with the virus continuing to transmit but causing much less disruption. He added: It will tend to, I think, settle into a seasonal pattern - we may still get quite big winters of infection but not the sort of level where we can justy wholesale societal closedown.  So, I think it is genuinely an optimistic picture, but weaposre still not quite there yet. The University College Londonexpert said there were very encouraging signs of cases plateauing or dropping in some places, but nobody was sure whether they will stabilise at a very high level or dip down. The latest UK data shows , people were reported as positive for Covid on Monday, with the seven-day rolling average showing a % drop in cases in a week.  Meanwhile, hospital admissions remain fairly static, though they are falling in some parts of the country. New data from the Office for National Statisticsis due to be published on Wednesday afternoon which will show the level of infection across the community in people with and without symptoms. Across England there are currently , Covid patients in hospital, down from , a week ago.  Elsewhere, Dr David Nabarro said it is important that there is no premature promising that restrictions will end at a particular time after suggestions the Government will drop Plan B at the review stage on January .The World Health Organisationaposs special envoy on Covid- told BBC Breakfast: Iaposm a public health person ... I would not be making promises some time in the future because, once you make a promise, itaposs super hard then to change what youaposre going to do - you feel youaposre kind of doing a U-turn.This virus is constantly evolving and itaposs super hard to predict where it will be - we can say where we hope weaposre going to go, we can say where weaposd like to go, we can say what we think we need to do to get there - but making promises that weaposll do something on a particular date, I think, is unwise. Dr Nabarro reiterated his view that the situation in the UK gives us grounds for hope but continued to urge caution. The goal that weaposre all aiming for is a situation where this virus is present, but le is organised so that it is not disrupted, he said. We also need to be humble, this virus is continuing to evolve and weaposre never quite sure that we know exactly where itaposs going to go next.

Mondelez referred to a study that they said supported their view that a personaposs ability to swallow was not affected by the position they ate in, including when eating upside down. Based on the research, and because Dairylea was a soft food, they considered there was a very low risk of choking when eating upside down. The ad had also been given an ex-kids scheduling restriction, but Mondelez said they were no longer running it and would remove references to eating upside downthey used it in future. The Advertising Standards Authoritysaid it sought advice from the Child Accident Prevention Trust, whose view was that the scenario depicted in the ad represented a situation where there was potentially a high risk of choking. The ASA also noted that one complainant had reported that their three-year-old relative, after seeing the advert, ate their food whilst hanging upside down.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The ASA said: We therefore considered that eating whilst upside down was an unsafe practice and one which could be dangerous for children to emulate. We therefore concluded that a scheduling restriction was not sufficient to reduce the risk of harm and that the ad breached the Code. The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again, adding: We told Mondelez UK to ensure their advertising did not condone or encourage unsafe practices. A Mondelez spokesman said: We recognise and will abide by the ASAaposs decision but we are disappointed by the ruling. We carefully consulted with Clearcast to pre-approve the content of this video on demand advert prior to airing. It was aimed at adultsrather than young children and was deliberately scheduled away from programming likely to appeal to children under . As such, we believe it was unlikely to encourage aposcopycatapos behaviour by young children. We remain committed to responsible advertising and work with a range of partners to make sure our marketing meets and complies with all relevant UK regulations.

The surprising one-bedroom home located near the town centre of Ramsbottom in Manchester is being listed for £, - and is worthy of George Clarke aposs Amazing Spaces according to some. Based on Spring Street, the tiny house also has a pocket-sized kitchen-living area and a petite en-suite bathroom, reports the Manchester Evening News.And while this might not seem like anything out of the ordinary, the interior of the property has got people talking online - all because of the dimensions. The propertyaposs half-sized staircase is one particular eye-catching detail - as is the size of the kitchen. Some users on Twitter have blasted the layout of the property, while others say the house has real potential.“Everyone look at this terrible tiny house attempt,” a user named Hannah, tweeting, said. [It has] only two rooms and they’re both the worst use of space I’ve ever seen.  Others said the space made them feel queasy and that it had been built with little thought. However, other accounts defended the property, saying the right buyer could make it into a good home. “Yes, it is a pity, a tiny space but a decent interior designer or architect could make much better use, Gary Cummins tweeted.  GiveMeSpace added: “Narrowboats have had good layouts for decades, and I reckon the designer could learn a thing or two there too. The home, marketed by Pearson Ferrier, is an end of terrace home. It features gas central heating, double glazing and no onward chain.

When the law was introduced in  it was named after Max, now , from Winsford, Cheshire, and his donor Keira Ball, who died aged nine in a car accident near her home in Barnstaple, Devon.  Colin, , said: “Max and Keira’s Law is a great thing. It takes pressure off the donor family at a time when they do not want to be thinking of these kinds of issues. “They want to be thinking about their loved one the law we had before made everything very traumatic.

Karen Fay, , said she wanted the ground to swallow her up when she could not ride the Nickelodeon Land ride in Blackpool with her youngster daughter Charlotte. Her seatbelt buckle wouldn’t fasten between Karen’s legs, meaning the ride could not start so she had to get off and walk back past a queue of onlookers. After the incident, Karen was so upset she joined Slimming World the next day. The mum-of-two used to feast on pork chops and chips, baguette and crisps and chocolatey snacks washed down with a glass of wine. But since switching to fruit snacks, healthier meals, and gin soda, she has dropped a whopping six dress sizes. After weighing st lb at her heaviest, Karen now weighs a trim st lb and has gone from a size  to a comfortable . “My little girl was four at the time and she wanted to go on the ride, she said. “I wasn’t going to go on, but the guy said do you want to go on it with her as they had adult seats so I said ‘okay, yeah’. “The ride couldn’t start because it wouldn’t buckle. I was absolutely mortied. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me. Karen, a director at her family-run specialist cleaning firm, piled on the pounds after having kids and weighed  st lbs after the birth of her second child Charlotte in . After the incident at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in , she decided to do finally something about her weight. She lost three stone following Slimming World’s food optimisation plans, but in  she struggled to reach the pedals of her new car which was another jolt.  Karen, who’s originally from Glasgow but now lives in Morecambe, Lancs., added: “We went back the next year and I made a point of riding the ride and it felt absolutely amazing. “I weighed about  stone, but I knew I could fit on the ride. “I was in and out the doors of Slimming World for a few years and in  we bought a new car and I could barely reach the pedals, I wasn’t comfortable at all. “I was up and down, I’d lose a couple of stone and put a stone back on.” In March , at the start of lockdown, Karen weighed  stone and was attending virtual Slimming World meetings. But when Lancashire was plunged into tier three restrictions in September, she decided she’d had enough of feeling unhappy with her weight and firmly stuck to the plan. By May , she had lost a total of st lbs and hit her initial target weight. But she knew she could lose more and lost another stone by September. Karen added: “I looked at myself in the mirror and I said to myself ‘get a grip’ and I got absolutely stuck in. “I’d started power walking and I had been challenged to do a couch to k in . In April , I ran my first k, it took me  minutes. “All through lockdown I kept up my running every day. The hour’s exercise we were allowed outside I spent running. “The weight started to come off, but I knew I could do more.” Now a slimline st lb, Karen has lost eight inches off her bust,  inches off her hips and a whopping  inches off her waist.  Before, Karen would start the day with cereal and full fat milk or toast with butter followed by a baguette, salad bowl, chocolate bar and crisps and pork chops and chips for dinner. Now she enjoys porridge or wholemeal toast with scrambled egg no butter for brekky, home made soups or pasta for lunch and salmon, air-fried potatoes and veg for dinner. Her snacking habits have switched from crisps and chocolate to fresh fruit and she now enjoys gin sodas instead of wine. Karen credits the dramatic weight loss with changing her le giving her back her self-esteem and confidence. Now a confident runner, Karen completes a k three times a week and looks almost unrecognisable in photographs. And she has trained as a Slimming World consultant which she does in her spare time to help inspire others to follow in her footsteps. She added: “I weighed  and a half stone after the birth of my second child and I was miserable. “My first thought every day was about my size, my weight and what clothes I was going to wear. I never felt comfortable. “I think my whole attitude to le is more positive now. “I’m happy, I’ve been successful at losing the weight and it’s given me a new lease of le. “It’s given me my sparkle back. I had been involved in amateur dramatics and have been on stage, but a lot of the time it’s just a mask. “But now my confidence levels are sky high. I hope I can help other people get their sparkle.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Slimming WorldFitnessWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted.

But theyaposve had several homes together since they first started dating almost six years ago. After they became engaged, Meghan moved in to Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. But after their wedding, they wanted somewhere bigger to raise a family and went to the Queen with an idea. But according to a report the pair faced disappointment when the monarch rejected the request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.  The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate.

He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Before the birth of Archie, the couple moved into their Frogmore Cottage home, later than expected due to delays with renovation work. Itaposs just over two years since they moved out of Frogmore and started their new le in the US. But it has now emerged that Harry does not want to bring Meghan and their two children to the UK to visit, saying there is a lack of security. The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office unless he can have police protection for his family when in the UK. He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit.

Royal expert Ingrid Seward has said: She explains: Prince Harryaposs threat of legal action against his grandmotheraposs government will not sit kindly with her. The Queen does not like being threatened.During his time as a royal and after stepping down with we Meghan Markle, Harry has made several requests - some that have needed the Queenaposs permission.But there also appears to have been several times, when she has firmly put her foot down...

Click here to sign up. According to the unauthorised biography Meghan: A Hollywood Princess by Andrew Morton, Harry made his feelings clear when the tiara could not be made available for Meghanaposs hair fitting with her stylist before the big day. He writes: The prince, who needed acupuncture to stay calm in the run-up to the wedding, was overwrought when the chosen tiara could not be made instantly available for Meghan’s hairdresser Serge Normant, who had flown from New York to work on the hair fitting. The Queen’s formidable dresser Angela Kelly, who isof the Queen’s jewellery, is said to have informed the irate prince that certain security protocols had to be adhered to in order to access the priceless piece. A source revealed that he was told: ‘They’re kept under very tight lock and key. You can’t turn up and demand to have the tiara just because your hairdresser happens to be in town.’ Harry would have none of it, telling anyone who would listen: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’ His ringing phrase did her no favours. Living arrangements Weeks after Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, the couple faced disappointment when the Monarch rejected a request they made about their home.According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate. He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Military titles  In , Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals in order to set up a new le in America.And with it, they were stripped of their honorary military appointments and royal patronages.The monarch forced the pair to sever all official links with The Firm after they decided to renounce their duties and step away from public service for good. Among the titles that were taken away was Harryaposs military appointment of Captain General of the Royal Marines. Buckingham Palace said: Following conversations with The Duke, The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a le of public service. The honorary military appointments and Royal patronages held by The Duke and Duchess will therefore be ed to Her Majesty, before being redistributed among working members of The Royal Family. While all are saddened by their decision, The Duke and Duchess remain much-loved members of the family. A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan replied and said: As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role. We can all live a le of service. Service is universal. Royal styles As well as being stripped of their military titles and royal patronages, Harry and Meghan also had to agree to not use their HRH styles. Although the pair werenapost stripped of these by the Queen, they no longer use the style as they arenapost working members of the royal family. Remembrance wreath request  In November , Harry made a request to have a wreath laid on his behalf at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. Despite Harry having served for  years in the military, including two tours of Afghanistan, his request for his tribute to be laid at the London memorial last year was refused.In his book Battle of Brother, royal author Robert Lacey argues most people would consider Harryaposs request perfectly reasonable and a mark of respect but he adds that the Queen is said to have rejected the request as soon as it reached her attention. It took her aposall of two secondsapos to issue a refusal, Lacey writes, referring to an article by royal editor Rebecca English. The article stated the Cenotaph ceremony was sacrosanct to The Queen, who ensured nothing happened without her knowledge. While Harryaposs grandmother hugely admired her grandsonaposs military achievements, his request to lay a wreath, or have one laid on his behalf, showed a lack of understanding of what it means for him to be a non-working royal, the book claims. Security issuesMeanwhile, when it comes to Harry latest request for police protection for his family when in the UK, it has been reported that the Queen wonapost help his case.He and we Meghan, , lost their taxpayer-funded police protection after quitting their royal roles in . The couple, who live in Calornia with their children Archie, two, and seven-month-old Lilibet, fund their own security there. The Duke of Sussex claimed he is effectively in exile because it is “unsafe” for his family toto the UK. He claims his private security arrangements are not enough to ensure his family’s safety and privacy here.A royal source told the Sun : “This is not a matter for Her Majesty. She certainly won’t cave into his demands.“It is a matter for Her Majesty’s government. Who gets protection is not a gt the Queen can decide to give or take away.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryRoyal FamilyMeghan MarkleQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Recorded Covid- cases are on the rise again after around , were reported on January , amid a downward trend. The latest figures show positive Omicron cases have gone back up to ,, so itaposs still important for people to be able to tell when they have symptoms of the virus. Even though the current number of Covid cases are still signicantly less than the beginning of January when the total hit over ,, Covid deaths have soared to the highest in  months as a further  have been recorded in  hours.With this in mind, it is vital cases are kept down in order for le toto something a bit more normal. So how can you tellyou have Covid  Main symptoms of Omicron The ZOE COVID Symptom Study has put together data of the most common symptoms and Business Insider then used to the data to create a list of the full symptoms.The chart is based on when the virus first started spreading among people in the UK.The top two symptoms of Omicron were a runny nose and a headache. These cold-like symptoms are dferent to that of what most people experienced with the Delta iant.% of people had a runny nose, while % said they experienced a headache at some point. Dr. Claire Steves, a scientist involved with the study, said: The most reported symptoms of Omicron are really very much like a cold, especially in people whoaposve been vaccinated.  The full list is as follows:Runny nose -%. Headache - % Fatigue - % Sneezing - % Sore throat - % Persistent cough - % Hoarse voice - % Chills or shivers - % Fever - % Dizziness - % Brain fog - % Muscle pains - % Loss of smell - % Chest pain - %.The list does not distinguish between the vaccinated or unvaccinated. Why have we not seen an end to restrictions   Omicron has proven to be slightly dferent to the previous iant of concern. Now the dominant iation in the UK since December, its apparently high levels of transmissibility have seen it sweep across the UK and cause record numbers of people infected. Vaccines and the mutation being less severe than others, according to scientists, means that deaths and hospitalisations have not reached the same levels of the height of the pandemic in .  Despite this, staff shortages and high case numbers can put key services under strain and restrictions are put in place to stop them from becoming overwhelmed.Plan B restrictions are due to expire on January , but a report by The Times says that face masks could stay, while vaccine passports are expected to be axed along with work-from-home guidance.

Rhianna was enjoying out in a bar in Newcastle city centre on January  when three of her female friends suddenly became unwell. The Northumbria University student said two of the group, who had been sharing the same drink, started to be violently sick at the venue - with one even needing to be carried out by a bouncer.Speaking to Chronicle Live , -year-old Rhianna said: When we got home their breathing was raspy and their eyes were dilated.  They could all hear what I was saying to them but they couldnapost make sense of it. Rhianna took her friends to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead as they became increasingly unwell. I called an ambulance as [my friend] Sara [Begic] was especially bad, she said. Her breathing wasnapost right, she was hyperventilating. She wasnapost responding and going in and out of consciousness. They werenapost any ambulances available but they said aposyou need to get her to hospital now.apos All three women underwent tests to see whether they had been spiked. Rhianna said they are still waiting on the results. Sara Begic, , from Durham, believes her drink was spiked during the incident and is now worried about going out again following her ordeal. The Northumbria University law student said: It was horrible. The last thing I remember is sitting with my friends. I knew where I was but I just couldnapost do anything. I couldnapost move my body and the bouncer carried me out. I feel quite unsafe going out now. The group of friends revealed that this isnapost actually the first time they believe they have been spiked while on a night out in the city. One of the students, who did not want to be named, said she was spiked by an injection in her leg on December . She became ill later that night and went to hospital to be checked out the following morning. I felt like I had been possessed and my body felt freezing, she said. It was like I couldn’t physically stop myself from shaking it was probably the worst experience of my le. I don’t feel completely safe going back out again. Rhianna said the friends reported the injection spiking incident to the police but believed that the venue had been unable to help officers because of its poor CCTV footage. As a result, they decided not to report the second incident, which happened at the same venue. However, the friends hope that sharing their story will encourage others to be vigilant when on a night out. Just because people have stopped posting about [spiking] doesnapost mean that it isnapost still happening, Rhianna said.

Owners of The Isle of Barra Distillers decided to shorten the working week in a bid to offer workers more flexibility. The company says it hopes to give its tightly-knit team the opportunity to spend more time with loved ones and spend less time and money commuting. Ahead of the change, which began this month, employees agreed to work the same hours over fewer days - with people opting to work an extra two hours each sht. They have switched up their operation to make the transition work - meaning that orders are no longer being dispatched on a Friday. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Distillery manager Debbie MacMillan told the Mirror that the change was already having a positive impact. She said: The main kind of reason behind it is to offer work-le balance for each team member. Being on Barra, itaposs not so easy to get away without booking holidays so it lets staff travel to the mainland without hassle. Last weekend, two staff members took advantage and travelled for the three days they were off. Itaposs been a really positive start. She added: I think we felt two days a week was never long enough. Itaposs just given us more time. We donapost have to use as much holiday because we have the long weekend to get everything done. Itaposs already allowed us to have more time with family and friends. Itaposs already been more positive. Husband and we Michael and Katie Morrison, who founded the distillery, said: aposWe had discussions with employees to make sure this change will benefit everyone. aposThe four-day working week would provide employees with more free time outside of work, with no loss in pay. They are all looking forward to the change to their working week. aposIf at any point our teamaposs circumstances change, we of course look to make the hours work as best we can.apos Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ChildcareMental health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In photos and video footage, the cow can be seen with a third eye on its forehead, as well as four nostrils. Neeraj said: ”As soon as the cow gave birth, we thought it is some kind of a wound on his forehead before finding it as an eye with the help of a flashlight.  We then found four nostrils which further saw the locals thronging our home after the nocturnal birth. “The calf is moving normally and drinks milk from the motheraposs udder and makes good use of the third eye on his forehead. Itaposs more like God has visited us.” The Indian calf weighs around lbs and has a longer tongue than the average calf but is still managing to drink milk normally.  Locals believe the birth of the animal will bring villagers good luck and prosperity, with many showering the animal with gts such as coconuts and flowers. This is not the first calf with multiple eyes to be born. In May , a three-eyed calf arrived in Brynmawr, North Wales, where it was later slaughtered. Although the Indian calf is not destined for slaughter, its future is still uncertain, as one livestock department official believes the animal will not survive for long. They said: “These are rare cases but such mutant animals do not survive for a longer period.They either live for  months or they can die in a couple of weeks.” Neeraj has reached out to a local vet for a medical screening who confirmed that despite its unusual mutations, the three-eyed calf is currently healthy. The farmer also confirmed that the other calves that his cow has given birth to previously are in good health. He added: Before this delivery, she had given birth to two [calves]. They were healthy and without any mutation. As for the unusual appearance, a doctor has confirmed the cow’s extra features are purely down to science. Private practitioner, Madan Anand, said: The birth of a calf is just another case of deformity. It has nothing to do with the superstitions or even faith. “People should be made aware, especially those who are from rural areas who tend to worship such animals.  The local veterinarians in their respective domains such held awareness campaigns to avoid such practices.” Despite many seeing the calf’s rare appearance as a ine miracle, the vet maintained that the cause for the deformity is a hormonal disorder. The response from people in the immediate area suggested the calf was hugely important. It still struggled to stay upright as other calves do when they have just been born. But the reaction from the crowds which gathered suggested it had great signicance.

With so many artists out there, itaposs hard to know where to begin in the search for the right one. But one woman who entrusted her friend to do the ink was so horried by the final result that she was forced to get it fixed a week later.Jessica Williams shared the end product on her TikTok @jessicawilliams, where she said thank God for coverups.In a series of viral videos, Jessica explained: My friend and I tend to do a lot of things out of impulse because thataposs just how we are and it makes for great stories. After asking around for recommendations, the women were told about a mutual friend who tattoos at his house.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. This should have been red flag number one, she later realised. She explained: He showed us some of his work. His girl was there and she had her whole body covered in tattoos he did and they werenapost bad. He also tattooed himself and they werenapost bad. So she showed him a picture of what she wanted doing, a dainty design of two hands reaching out to each other. But unfortunately for Jessica, her Michelangeloaposs The Creation of Adam inspired piece ended up looking more like ET from the iconic phone home scene. She added: He put the stencil on, it looked great. It was what I wanted. But when I looked down when it was finished, that wasnapost the stencil... at all. The hands instead ended up looking more like claws thanks to the wobbly linework. Jessica later ended up going to a proper tattoo shop to get the ink fixed. She explained: The new tattoo artist told me that from the way it looked, the [mutual friend] pressed way too hard for it to be on my rib cage which was going to make it harder for him to cover up. So a week later, once the design has healed slightly, she went back to have it covered over with some flowers. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , likes and , comments from people who were stunned by the final result. One person said: Iaposve never done a tattoo in my le but I genuinely think I can do better. Another wrote: Iaposve seen jail tats better than that. A third commented: YOUaposRE JOKING ! WERE THE ARTISTaposS EYES CLOSED  Someone  put: This is the first one thataposs made me audibly cackle. Itaposs giving ET phone home.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Waves reaching up to  metres hit the outer Haaposapia island group, destroying all of the houses on the island of Mango, as well as the west coast of Tongaaposs main island, Tongatapu, the prime ministeraposs office said. In Kanokupolu village on the island of Tongatapu locals have been pictured staring at trees that have been felled, buildings in ruins and everything coated in black ash. James Garvin, chief scientist at NASAaposs Goddard Space Flight Center, said the force of the eruption was estimated to be equivalent to five to  megatons of TNT, an explosive force more than  times the nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. The blast was heard as far away as Alaska and was probably one of the loudest events to occur on Earth in over a century, according to Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.This might be the loudest eruption since [the eruption of the Indonesian volcano] Krakatau in , Poland told NPR. That massive th-century eruption killed thousands and released so much ash that it cast much of the region into darkness. Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haaposapai was completely destroyed by Saturdayaposs explosion, says Dan Slayback, a research scientist for NASAaposs Goddard, as well as Science Systems and Applications Inc. Slayback says the blast was so massive it even appears to have taken chunks out of the older islands nearby. They werenapost ash — they were solid rock, blown to bits, he says. It was quite amazing to see that happen.  With its airport smothered by volcanic ash and communications badly hampered by the severing of an undersea cable, information on the scale of the devastation has mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft. Planes sent from New Zealand show the damage from the air with images of the inundation caused by tsunami on the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.  A dficult humanitarian aid effort is now under way to help the survivors from the disaster. The Red Cross said its teams in Tonga had confirmed that salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash were polluting the drinking water relied on by tens of thousands of people. Securing access to safe drinking water is a critical immediate priority... as there is a mounting risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea, Katie Greenwood, the Pacic head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement.

The blizzard led to snowfalls more than ft deep which blocked doors and windows, reaching as high as the first floor in some areas. She was eventually found  hours after she initially went missing while ing from school. It took the search team  hours to find and rescue the youngster.  To keep herself alive, she was hugging a fluffy dog for warmth, according to local media. When found, Vika was lying with the stray mongrel on a mattress which animal-loving locals had put out for homeless pooches. It was lodged under a low balcony where they could shelter from the storm.  Local media initially reported she clambered into a kennel, which was later corrected. “She was taken straight to hospital, and found to have mild frostbite,” said a local source. She had left school at pm, and was found next morning at :am. Olesya Voznyuk, an official with the Investigative Committee, said: “She was hiding under a balcony with the dog. The girl loves animals very much, she used to play with local dogs all the time.“She went to feed these dogs after school and then got caught in the snow storm and strong winds.” The space under the balcony gave some shelter but it still took more than  people over  hours to find her from when her parents raised the alarm .  Her “relieved” mother Tatyana, , was reunited with Vika at hospital. The girl was allowed home the same day . Now there are plans to honour the dog that saved Vika -they can find it after the pooch went missing.

Mainland China aposs zero-tolerance policy is what led to the decision to cull the rodents, leaving animal lovers outraged.Authorities have ordered the hamsters to be put down humanely as well as putting a stop to imports and sales.Have your say on this situation in the comment section Multiple pet shops have been shut and disinfected as men in protective gear were seen cleaning the pet shop that is in the heart of the Causeway Bay district. Health Secretary Sophia Chan told a news conference authorities were acting out of caution even though there was no evidence domestic animals can infect humans. Meanwhile, the director for Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has told people to avoid kissing their pets and to wash their hands after touching them.  Leung Siu-fai told reporters: Pet owners should keep a good hygiene practice, including washing hands after touching the animals, handling their food or other items, and avoid kissing the animals. Leung said the hamsters had to be put down because it would be impossible to quarantine and observe each one. He also said that anyone who bought hamsters after December should hand them over to be culled and not leave them on the streets.  A hotline for enquiries is being set up, while some of the  customers of the pet shop were going into quarantine, officials said. The animals were said to have been imported from the Netherlands, local broadcaster RTHK said. Authorities in Hong Kong have also been carrying out Covid tests on rabbits and chinchillas, but only hamsters have tested positive so far. The local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which runs veterinary clinics, said it was shocked at the decision.In a statement, the organisation said: The SPCA is shocked and concerned over the recent government announcement on the handling of over , small animals, which did not take animal welfare and the human-animal bond into consideration. Research head Jan Schmidt-Burbach said:Culling animals should always be a last resort and we encourage governments to explore other options, such as quarantine, first.  Throughout the pandemic, there have been reported Covid- cases in dogs and cats, but scientists say there is no evidence to say animals play a major role in human contagion. Nikolaus Osterrieder, dean of the Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Le Sciences at the City University of Hong Kong said: It is obviously a drastic measure but one that is a consequence of zero Covid . Hamsters are very susceptible to SARS-CoV- and can produce large amounts of virus. Hong Kong has triggered fresh restrictions after dozens of new Covid cases. Last year, three pet cats that tested positive for Covid were put down in the Chinese city of Harbin, sparking outrage on social media. In , Denmark culled millions of mink over a Covid- mutation.

We also managed to keep the construction of Project Cosmos, now known as MY Galactica, on schedule - which was no mean feat.

A team working for TV channel Sat. have handed the evidence to detectives probing Brueckner over the infamous case.British youngster Madeleine was just three-years-old when she vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal in . German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead and named convicted paedophile Brueckner as their only suspect. Despite going public with the information in June , they have still not charged him with any offence. But now Sat. investigators claim to have found fresh evidence linking Brueckner, who denies any involvement, to the crime. They will reveal more information about their investigation in a prime-time documentary, which is yet to have an air date. Announcing the show, Sat. said journalist Jutta Rabe and a team of reporters gathered new information about Brueckner. They claim it includes proof he was near Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished while her parents dined in a tapas restaurant. The channel said they collected “many new clues and indications” that corroborate the suspicions of German prosecutors. Editor-in-chief Juliane Ebling said: “The sad story of Madeleine McCann is a story that has many German facets. “The case is being tried at the Regional Court of Braunschweig, as the German Christian B. is the main suspect.  “In his environment there are many German women and men who can describe inidual details surrounding the crime. “Jutta Rabe has researched shocking material in Germany, Portugal and England over the past months, which heavily incriminates Christian B.” Sat. confirmed the show will be airing on German TV but said “no exact broadcast date has been set”. When contacted by the Mirror, chief public prosecutor Hans-Christian Wolters was unavailable for comment. His office confirmed in December that they soon hope to charge Brueckner with raping a woman in Portugal. He is suspected of attacking Irish waitress Hazel Behan in the Algarve three years before Madeleine vanished.  She waived her right to anonymity two years ago to come forward and accuse Brueckner of attacking her in . The German, , is already serving a jail term for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in . Mr Wolters said he is % convinced” Brueckner also killed Madeleine, who was just three when she vanished. The German was living in a camper van close to Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappeared.

By the time the kayak arrived, only the roof of her car was visible above the sub-zero water. According to witnesses who shared videos of the crash on social media, at one point she said: Oh well. I guess Iaposll walk.  Police responded to the scene at .pm, and charged her with dangerous driving.But driving on ice is not actually illegal in the country, where it snows often, the MailOnline reports. Paramedics also attended but the woman refused treatment, according to Canadaaposs National Post newspaper. One Twitter user recalled seeing the woman drive past him at speed and rip by.He added that he wasnapost surprised she ran into trouble on the ice.  A separate video showed the car careening across the frozen river at a high speed. However, this couldaposve been caused by skidding rather than acceleration. In a press release, the Ottawa Police Service said: @This portion of the river has thin ice compared to other areas of the river. This portion of the river has thin ice compared to other areas of the river,apos said the Ottawa Police Service.  Ice conditions at this time of the year can be unpredictable. The Ottawa Police Service would like to remind residents to stay off the ice and remember aposNo Ice is Safe Iceapos. The vehicle remains where it sank in the river. Police have warned it could be a hazard for people curious while wandering around on the ice.

Regrettably, the principle of development is not considered acceptable in this location.”.removeIt adds: “The planning authority understands the applicant’s circumstances and need to find alternative, fit for purpose family accommodation that meets their very specic needs. Unfortunately, their very specic personal circumstances are not material to the assessment of this application and cannot be taken into account when determining the acceptability, or otherwise, of the proposed development.”However, at the meeting Mr Moffat, of the SNP, moved a formal proposal to approve the plans which was seconded by Hawick representative Clair Ramage.He said: “The family want to stay in the community where they have got a support mechanism. It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances. In pure planning terms I’ve heard what has been said and normally you wouldn’t take certain things into consideration.“I don’t often disagree with the planning officers [but] I would quite happily approve this in principle because it’s the right thing to do.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kelso-shoplifting-offence-man-33-sentence-deferred","story":"A -year-old man has admitted a charge of theft by shoplting at Selkirk Sherf Court.Daniel Hamilton gave an address in Kelso.Sentence was deferred until the outcome of his trial on June  for a charge of possession of a bladed article in a public place."},{"url":null,"title":"scott-praises-efforts-departing-boss-hastings","story":"MARTIN ‘Jimmy’ Scott says he is \"honoured and excited\" to take over as manager of Gala Fairydean Rovers.The former Ross County and Hibs player joined Rovers last summer as assistant to Neil Hastings, who has left the club for a full-time position.Scott has appointed former Aberdeen player Steven Craig as his number two and he will join the club this week.Speaking following his appointment the new gaffer said: “I’m honoured and excited to be appointed manager of the club and I am really looking forward to getting started this week.“It will be a smooth transition for me, and this is credit to the players, staff and everyone who’s involved in the operation of the club.“I’ve worked very closely with Neil over the last six months and ultimately the philosophy will remain the same in how we want to approach the game although I will always keep putting the demands on the players to improve on the good work already done.“I have added Steven Craig to assist with first team operations and to attract someone of Stevie’s pedigree shows what a fantastic club we have here and he’s very excited to start working with myself, staff and the squad.“On a personal note, I’m absolutely delighted for Neil moving to a full-time position in football.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll ranked one of the most peaceful locations in britain","story":"With demand for rural retreats rising and more people looking to escape the typical tourist hotspots for a tranquil break, holiday provider Cottages in Northumberland carried out research to find the top places to find peace and quiet in England, Scotland and Wales.Thinking about what makes an area quiet – no people, no noise, no light pollution and lots of nature and wildle – Cottages in Northumberland pulled together data covering population count, National Park counts and Dark Sky sites.This data was then ranked to reveal the UK#s quietest areas as follows:  Powys, Wales  Northumberland, England  The Highlands, Scotland  Argyll and Bute, Scotland  Morayshire, Scotland  North Yorkshire, England  Pembrokeshire, Wales  Cumbria, England  Aberdeenshire, Scotland  Devon, England.Just missing out on a podium spot, Argyll and Bute ranked highly thanks to the area#s low population count of  people per square kilometre, which is actually the third lowest count in the UK overall, following the Scottish Highlands and Western Isles.Being home to Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park and the internationally recognised Isle of Coll Dark-Sky Community also helped boost Argyll and Bute#s position.The only Scottish location to rank higher was the Highlands which came third in the overall rankings.Having the lowest population count in the whole of the UK, with a mere nine people per square kilometre, helped to elevate the Highlands into the bronze position.It also home to the Cairngorms National Park which is a centre for outdoor activity, with mountains, lochs, woodland forests and rivers, as well as small local villages which are lovely to explore.And whilst the Highlands does not have an internationally recognised Dark Sky park, it does have  Milky Way sites, ranking it second in the UK for Dark Sky sites.In second place, Northumberland was deemed England#s quietest place.The coastal county, which houses Northumberland National Park, has a low population count of  people per square kilometre.It is also well known for its stargazing potential, boasting one Dark Sky Orion site and  Milky Way sites – more sites than anywhere  in the UK.And taking the top spot, Powys in Wales was officially crowned the best place for peace and quiet in Great Britain.With a population count of  people per square kilometre, and home to the Brecon Beacons National Park where there are endless woodlands, waterfalls, hills, moorlands, and heritage sites to explore, Powys is undoubtedly a place of peace and serenity."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

weekly to choose a dish, go to the shops to buy ingredients, cook the meal and eat it together.Recipes include nachos and truffles Once a month, a group of older people from the community would join the session for an intergenerational meet and eat.Now, the youth project carries out a class online, where one young person takes the role of head chef and demonstrates how to make their chosen dish – ingredients are delivered to the chef’s home by staff from the youth project, which received funding from Tesco Community Grants to do so.Beth Smith, lead youth worker, said: “Not only have the young people learned new recipes but they have also grown in confidence and fed their families.“We had been posting the dishes on Facebook and had quite a few comments from teachers at North Berwick High

Getting an understanding of your car’s true valueThough you might value your car highly – it might even hold great sentimental value for you – when you come to sell it, you’ll quickly discover that its true value is set by the market.Your car’s value will be affected by such factors as age, mileage, condition, and service history – but market prices are the biggest driver. So, it is essential that you get a good idea of its true market value before selling.. How to value your carThe good news is that getting an accurate idea of your car’s value is quicker and easier than it’s ever been. There are now many online websites – such as Motorway – that will provide you with an instant estimated sale price for your car based on current market data, just by entering your reg number.However, you could also scan the pages of Auto Trader and eBay to check what prices similar models are reaching in private sales.. Making an informed choiceKnowing what you want from the sale of your car will help inform how you sell. Ask yourself, what do you care about most  Speed, convenience, or final selling price If you just want to sell the car as quickly as possible – and are willing to sacrice a bit on the end price for convenience, then you should probably choose an instant car-buying website or part-exchange your car at a dealership.If you are more interested in getting the best price you can for your car, then selling privately on a classied website or online auction is typically a better option. However, before embarking on this, it is worth remembering that selling privately can be a long and drawn-out process and it might involve you showing your car to a large number of prospective buyers over a long period.. Pick the best selling route for youIf you do decide to sell privately, you might attain a higher price than you would at an instant car-buying website. However, you’re also picking a sale route with no guarantees. Plus, you will most likely have to deal with several prospective buyers coming to your house, putting up with timewasters, and potentially bartering over the car’s price.Until recently, private selling, part-exchanging and instant car-buying sites were the only way to sell, butyou want convenience and the best price for your car, you could try Motorway.Motorway will put your car on sale with a nationwide network of more than , veried car dealers – who will then compete to buy your car. Not only is it quick and easy, but with this free online service, you can potentially receive more than £, more for your car.. Preparing your carIf you’re selling to an instant car buyer or part-exchanging, you won’t need to do too much with your car except to remove your belongings from it before handing over your keys.If you’re selling privately, however, you should ensure that your car is looking as good as possible to avoid prospective buyers chipping away at the price at the last minute.Make sure that your car is cleaned thoroughly inside and out and –it’s worth your while – fix any minor issues, such as correcting small dents and scratches. Replacing worn floor mats and buying a good-quality air freshener is usually a good idea.If you are using an online service like Motorway, it is also a good idea to make your car look as good as possible, as their network of veried dealers will study pictures of your car before they compete to make you an offer.. Knowing when to negotiateThough you are less likely to negotiateyou use an instant online car-buying service, some will try to chip down the price at the last minutethey discover the condition of your car is in any way dferent to how you initially described it.If you are selling privately or part-exchanging then you should probably be prepared to barter over the priceyou want to make a good deal. When meeting a car dealeror prospective buyer ensure you’re armed with research about what your car is worth. You should always try to stand your ground and be prepared to walk away from the negotiationa dealer or prospective buyer tries to radically reduce the price when they inspect your car.If you have done the requisite research, this will give you confidence about the car’s true value – and you will know when a dealer or potential buyer is trying to pull a fast one.If negotiating with buyers and dealers seems daunting, consider using Motorway’s free service which will match your car with a veried dealer willing to pay the best price without the need for negotiating.. Getting paymentHowever you choose to sell your car, it is vital that you don’t hand over your car keys until you have been paid. Never allow a buyer to pay by cheque or promise to transfer the money later.A reputable buyer will understand you need to be paid before you hand over the keys – either with cash or bank transfer. If it’s a transfer, you need to confirm that the appropriate funds have reached your bank account – or request evidence that the transfer has been completed in the form of a receipt or digital transaction statement.Motorway’s service is totally free for sellers – and payment is always made by secure bank transfer.. After the saleOnce you have confirmed payment for your car, you should hand over your car keys , the ‘new owner’ section of your VC , and your service and MOT history.As well as informing the DVLA that you have sold your car, you need to cancel your car insurance and reclaim your road tax. Many drivers don’t realise road tax can be reclaimed after the sale of a car. The DVLA actually makes this process very easy on their website.This article was brought to you in association with Motorway "},{"url":null,"title":"best-crypto-exchanges-2022","story":"Once you make the decision to become a crypto investor, there will inevitably be a series of questions floating around your head.

However, since eToro is available through a desktop site and mobile app, this is one of the speediest and most user-friendly brokerage sites in the business. As for the benefits of using eToro compared with some of the other exchanges, there are some fairly obvious advantages.

On the downside, Binance isn’t quite as competitive when it comes to fees! How to Sign Up to a Crypto ExchangeNow that we have broken down some of the pros and cons of the main exchange s, we’d like to also outline just how easy it is to register with them. There is a fairly standard process required to open an online investment account, and in terms of personal requirements, you must be over the legal investing age and be a resident of a crypto-supported country. Providing that you satisfy these criteria, you can set yourself up with a new trading account by running through the following:The Registration ProcessFirst thing’s first, you have to actually create your online account before you can invest in any cryptos at all. This is required at all exchange s, in accordance with FCA, ASIC, and FINRAregulations. So, once you’ve decided which exchange site you’d like to joinyou must create a fresh username and password for that site. Your username has to be unique, and the password must be strong so that it cannot be hacked into easily. From here, it’s time to supply the site with your personal details. In order for the site to very that you are legally allowed to trade crypto, you must provide your name, DOB, address, contact information, and title. Once these details have been shared, you can then set up any security questions that you wish to implement for your account. And finally, you must agree to the site’s terms and conditions before officially opening the account.  gtgtgt Register with eToro here ltltlt% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provide Verying Your DetailsOpening your account is just the first step in the process. Note that anyone could actually go ahead and open an account, but in order to enjoy unrestricted access to all products and services, your details must be veried. Some people assume that this is a complex and slow process, but we can assure you that this isn’t true. While you are signed in, you can head into your account profile where you should see a link to very your details. On that note, there are two things that the site needs to confirm - that you are resident in your stated country and that you are over the legal investing age.So, concerning ID verication, you are usually able to scan or upload a photo of either your driving license or passport. Since these documents have both your name and date of birth on them, this takes care of proving who you are. But in addition to this, you must then demonstrate that you are a legal resident, by proving your address. In order to do this, you can upload either a bank statement or utility bill, which usually needs to be a recent document .After you have submitted this information, your account should get veried within a few hours.Depositing FundsCrypto coins might be classied as digital assets, but your very first purchase of a crypto coin must be executed in fiat currency. This describes currencies that are legal tender in regulated countries, such as GBP, AUD, EUR, and USD . And in order to deposit some fiat into your account, you can choose between a range of supported payment methods on our recommended exchanges. In terms of the main methods, you’ll typically find a selection of the following:Making Your First Crypto PurchaseWith funds deposited into your account, you can start to browse through the list of coins that each  has available.

To avoid that, we’d like to highlight some key areas that you must look at before signing up with any exchange.User ExperiencePutting the actual range of products or cryptos aside for a moment, the user experience is often an overlooked area. When we say user experience, we mean how easy the  is to use, how well it has been designed, and whether it performs well in general. After all, you could sign up with the best crypto exchange in the world, butit is overly complex or dficult to use, your ultimate experience will not be satisfactory.Payment MethodsSome might also involve fees, which is why you must assess each of these things prior to processing a deposit or withdrawal.FeesFees can be charged by crypto exchanges for ious things. Of course, each of these fees takes money out of your account, and subsequently reduces the capital you have available for investing. In terms of what areas fees apply to, you could see fees for deposits, withdrawals, trades, and even for inactivity at some s. With that said, there are s out there that have all but eliminated fees for several of these areas. And the more you can reduce your fees, the more cash you’ll keep to invest.RegulationCrypto is a regulated market in many parts of the world, meaning that it is officially legal to buy and sell ious coins within certain borders. In this sense, you’ve not got much to worry about when it comes to the market as a whole. However, inidual coins certainly can fall victim to regulations in dferent countries around the world. Take XRP as a prime example - the Ripple project is still facing a legal battle against the SEC in the US, which has greatly impacted the price.Range of CryptosMuch like the range of payment methods discussed above, the more cryptos that a site has available, the better things are doing to be. After all, there is nothing more frustrating than identying a potentially great investment only to find that your chosen site doesn’t support it. But while an exchange might actually support your preferred crypto, you still need to identy what trading pairs are available for that specic coin.  gtgtgt Visit eToro here to get started ltltlt % of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerFinal ThoughtsWhen all is said and done, crypto exchanges are safe and reputable s that can be used to buy and sell ious crypto coins.

One of Scotlands highest villages, Braemar makes the list thanks to being \"perfect for hillwalking and mountain biking breaks, as well as ski trips\" due to its proximity to Glenshee, and simply because of its \"stunning terrain on all sides\".Rounding off the list is Moffat in Dumfries  Galloway Cullen, Moray Crail in Fe, Coldingham in the Scottish Borders and Brodick on Arran in North Ayrshire.A HomeToGo spokeswoman said: \"With searches for holiday accommodation in Scotland seeing a year-on-year increase of  per cent via hometogo, ahead of Burns Night on January , HomeToGo has taken a deep e into the data to reveal the top trending scenic Scottish destinations for travel in ..\"From the Hebrides to the Borders, these are the ten serene and scenic Scottish locations making a mark on itineraries for seaside staycations and countryside retreats this year.\"The list, created by the holiday rentals marketplace using a depth of internal search insight, shows the picturesque fishing village of Pittenweem in Fe soaring to the top spot.\"The top  is revealed as separate data found more Brits are choosing to holiday in the UK this year rather than heading off in search of some sun, as the staycation trend that boomed outside of pandemic lockdowns continues.A poll of more than , people found that % of Brits are planning to holiday closer to home this winter, compared with nine per cent planning to go abroad.Research by car finance provider Volkswagen Financial Servicesfound that % were planning a domestic road trip in the next few months as spring arrives, compared with % who hoped to jet off in search of sunshine abroad.Mike Todd, CEO at VWFS UK, said: “Holidaymakers were swapping their passports for walking boots and picnic blankets when staycations took off again last summer, but I don’t believe many people expected domestic getaways to be quite so popular this winter.“There are so many wonderful places to explore on these shores and even the great British weather isn’t stopping people enjoying a good old fashioned road trip.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dishonest-judge-rejects-tied-gagged-civil-servant-deeann-fitzpatricks-unfair-sacking-claim-marine-scotland","story":"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick claimed she was subjected to the ordeal for blowing the whistle on a culture of bullying and misogyny at Marine Scotland – but a tribunal has now found that she was dishonest about the timing and the reasons behind the incident.The image, which went viral at the peak of the #metoo movement, prompted a national outcry and an investigation by the Scottish Government body.However, the probe found the men involved had “no case to answer”, with the incident being described by some as office “high jinks” which she willingly took part in.Ms Fitzpatrick went on to be dismissed for gross misconduct over her lies.An employment tribunal has now backed that decision and rejected her bid to be reinstated by Marine Scotland and receive £, in compensation.Employment Judge Alexander Kemp said the tribunal concluded that the senior fishery officer “had been dishonest and not simply mistaken” about what happened – not that that was ever her position.He accepted that the photograph was taken in August , not – as Ms Fitzpatrick claimed – in December  after she reported an alleged assault on another member of staff.The judge said: “She maintained her position as to its date, and that position is, we concluded, wrong. It follows from that that the suggestion that it was a form of retaliation for her ‘blowing the whistle’, as she put it, cannot be right.”Ms Fitzpatrick was also dismissed for falsying emails about the incident and the tribunal found that these were likely “not genuine”.However, while the judge found in favour of Marine Scotland, he also fired a warning shot to the body over the “kindergarten” culture within its Scrabster office and its handling of the whole affair.The judgment states: “The claimant had the perception that she had been the victim of a bullying culture for a very long period. Whilst we have made the findings that we have, not all that she said in evidence was, we considered, unreliable or untrue.“Some of the behaviours at the office were entirely wrong. It was not a kindergarten, but a government office charged with enforcing the law. It was, at least for a material period, dysal, given the evidence of how those working there conducted themselves, and not all steps that were recommended to be taken to remedy that were.”The tribunal heard that while Ms Fitzpatrick had ious opportunities to raise the chair incident with managers or HR professionals, the first time she did so was “fleetingly” when she was facing another unrelated disciplinary in .It was not mentioned again until she raised an employment tribunal in , alleging harassment.While it was not part of her original claim in that case, she mentioned the incident while giving evidence and it received widespread media attention, with the image later being published widely in the press and on social media.This prompted a backlash against the men involved – Reid Anderson and Jody Paske – which Judge Kemp said was “so dreadful” some of it amounted to criminal conduct.Marine Scotland said Ms Fitzpatrick’s lies caused that abuse, as well as a subsequent police investigation into the men which resulted in Police Scotland taking no further action.The tribunal heard that Mr Anderson’s we even wrote to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell of the “living hell” they had been suffering and claiming that Ms Fitzpatrick had been harassing and bullying them, including via an online petition.Ms Fitzpatrick is also said to have upset other co-workers by making “derogatory and offensive” statements about them online, while she also wrote to Ms Sturgeon and said being asked to meet with a manager to discuss the chair incident was like “having to sit with a rapist while he gets away with the crime”.She was ultimately dismissed for lying about the timing and the nature of the incident after a digital forensic expert said it was beyond doubt that the photo was taken in August .Lying on oath at the previous tribunal and providing  details to the media also formed part of her disciplinary.Judge Kemp also rejected her claims for breach of contract and whistleblowing."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-goodwin-explains-jamie-mcgrath-st-mirren-absence-transfer-speculation-messing-head","story":"The Buddies attacking midfielder has been linked with a move to the English Championship with his contract due to expire in the summer.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC. However, there has been no lack of discussions over the years.

The cost of the bid was £million.Simon Hodge, chief executive of Crown Estate Scotland, said: #Today’s results are a fantastic vote of confidence in Scotland’s ability to transform our energy sector.

While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious. She was built especially for this purpose to give new le and to find out just how able you really are.“I#ll never forget my voyage and the wonderful friends I made and so overwhelmed at how challenges were overcome. Thank you Tenacious and thank you to the magnicent permanent crew who led and guided us all the way.”Patrick Fleming, JST’s chief executive, said: “Tenacious is the only tall ship designed to be sailed by a mixed ability crew – allowing fellow voyage crew members to join in with the day-to-day activities on board.“It’s great to hear stories from people like Mavis who’s lives have been truly touched by the experiences offered onboard.”The JST charity offers people of all abilities the opportunity to climb aboard their tall ship Tenacious for an immersive sailing experience and relies on funding from the public. Since its founding in , the Jubilee Sailing Trust has welcomed more than , people on board."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BOOK-LUKE-EVELING-4-scaled.jpg","title":"school pupils face massive social loss due to","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine of the worrying experiences he had witnessed among contemporaries during two years of the pandemic.And the pleas were echoed by the education chair of Highland Council, who urged the UK and Scottish Governments to make the wellbeing of school pupils a priority in the year ahead.Skye Councillor John Finlayson’s comments came after a record number of more than , cases of Covid- recorded across Scotland just a few days before schools ed in the region.The council’s education chair said Highland Council was committed to getting young people back to school and believed there should be a big push for –-year-olds to receive the Covid- vaccines.Expanding on the matter of how coronavirus had impacted education, the former head teacher said he believed that the pandemic had acutely affected the social and mental wellbeing of youngsters..“We have lived through two years that are completely dferent to any period in education we have ever seen.“While the impact on the academia side of things has been a real concern, the other side effects relating to mental health and wellbeing, socialisation, developing and sustaining relationships are also crucial.“The curriculum in its broadest sense is everything that happens in a school. So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

When I stung my hand on the nettles, she said to apply a leaf of dock growing nearby.It gave instant relief, and she observed that the two plants were never far apart. She then recited a rhyme which I did not remember as well as I should have, but was able to recover years later from a neighbour from the Glen:‘Dock leaf smooth, mild, gentleThe nettle has stung me’Three decades later, when the project was only in its initial stages, John Lorne Campbell was approached about making available his extensive collection of field recordings to this national resource.As a long-time lover of technology as well as Gaelic traditions, he agreed without a moment’s hesitation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

It would have cost just £m to make up the shortfall for the rest of the financial year, but we were told this was not possible,” he said.“People across the North are currently engulfed in a cost of living crisis. We have seen a failure to support people dealing with massive energy bills, experiencing food poverty, welfare claimants and those on social housing waiting lists. During the peak of our pandemic minimal support was offered and took an age to be issued.“People were crying out for self-isolation support and mitigation payments. There was no proposal to bring forward proper mortgage payment support. This money could have done a lot of good and I cannot fathom why it was surrendered at a time of so much need and so little delivery from Minister Hargey.”DfC has been contacted for comment.The news comes after the Belfastrevealed that the Department of Justice handed back more than £m to DoF since the beginning of the last financial year.DoJ figures show that, over the course of the   financial year, £m in non ring-fenced resource expenditure  was handed back to DoF, while just over £m in capital expenditure was ed over the same period.Up to the end of December of this financial year £.m in non ring-fenced resource expenditure and £.m in capital spending was ed to the DoF.Related topicsDeirdre HargeyDepartment for CommunitiesDepartment of Finance Andy AllenMark H.

It was designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and came into force on January , .Commenting on the rise in freight traffic from GB into Northern Ireland, Mr Leheny explained the tougher controls at Dublin Port has contributed to the sht.And Jarlath O#Keefe, from Grant Thornton Ireland, said: The CSO figures for November confirmed that there has been a signicant increase in cross border trade on the island of Ireland in  following Brexit. This is due in part to businesses adjusting their supply chains to avoid the administrative burden associated with importing goods from Britain.”The Department for Agriculture , which is responsible for implementing the protocol, revealed a total of , checks were carried out on , consignments at Northern Ireland’s ports between January , and December , .On average, a total of , trailers or vehicles from GB pass through Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint ports each year.Sanitary and Phytosanitaryconsignments subject to checks includes live animals, products of animal origin, plant and plant products, and high risk food not of animal origin.The three types of checks required are documentary, identity and physical. Straightforward documentaryand identitychecks made up , of the total checks in . Only , physical checks had to be carried out on lorries.Mr Leheny explained physical checks, which can last for several hours, are a “last resort”the documentary or identity paperwork is not up to scratch.He added that the number of consignment checks would have created a lot more admin work for DAERA officials, hauliers and traders.“A physical inspection is a last resort so it’s natural that would be as low as it is becausethe documentation doesn#t give DAERA the information they need well then they have to open up the doors,” said Mr Leheny.“They would say it’s potentially an unknown load so we have to physically open up the trailer and see what’s in it.”The DUP’s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson felt the figures should act as a “sobering statistic” for those who think the protocol is necessary. Behind those figures is a story of additional costs, delays, disrupted supply chains and products which had to be disposed of because checks meant goods got ruined,” he said.DUP MLA Diane Dodds added that % of all EU checks take place between GB and Northern Ireland and the figures highlight “the scale of the Irish Sea border imposed by the protocol”.“It is % more expensive to transport goods into Northern Ireland now because of the protocol#s paperwork costs,” she continued. “The Government has a responsibility to take action and we need to see a timetable for progress quickly set out.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the “best way” to reduce checks at ports is for the UK Government to agree to an EU proposal for a Swiss-style veterinary agreement, which would remove almost all physical SPS checks.“We have been making this proposal for months because we know that it will reduce checks and controls by %,” said the Foyle MP.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the SPS checks are a product of Brexit, and “in particular the decision” of the UK Government to opt for a hard Brexit.“An SPS agreement is necessary to reduce the current checks and those that would be otherwise requiredthe grace period ends without a permanent solution,” he stated.A spokesperson for DAERA said under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland is required to apply SPS checks on eligible goods entering the EU zone from GB, in line with those checks prescribed for Third Countries.

However, no progress has been made.A petition calling on the council to take action and restore Wilmont House to its former glory has been signed by more than  people so far.It was launched by local woman Sharon Marks, who said she had noticed the poor state of the building while taking walks in Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park during lockdown.“About a year ago, I contacted the council to see what the plans for the building were as it was gted to the council and the people of Belfast,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “For such a beautul building to fall into such a state of disrepair is just so sad. “The council said it was planning on carrying out an expression-of-interest exercise in early  to find someone to bring it back into use, but the pandemic has delayed this. “That really hacked me off, so I got in contact with local politicians to bring things forward, but that didn’t get very far.“One or two people in the council shouldn’t be gatekeepers of Wilmont House. “It was gted to the council and all the people of Belfast. People should be able to enjoy it.“It is such a beautul building and for that amount of heritage and history to be lost would be terrible.”Donal Lyons, a member of Belfast City Council’s growth and regeneration committee, agreed action should be taken.“There’s not many buildings like Wilmont House left in Belfast, let alone ones in such a setting, and we need to ensure that they are protected for future generations,” he said. “We’re lucky to have them. Each one of them captures a moment in the city’s history and everyone has their own personal stories in which these beautul buildings play a role. “We need to do more than just let them sit in decay.”A spokesperson for the council said: “Wilmont House at Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park is a Grade B-plus listed building owned by Belfast City Council. “We are in the process of preparing an invitation for expressions of interest to go to the market later this year, seeking a suitably qualied developer to restore the building and bring it into a new use.”Wilmont House, which dates back to , served as the headquarters of the US Army in Northern Ireland during the Second World War. It was later used as a nursing home and a parks office for the council.

Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said: “The latest survey results paint a dire picture of where our industry currently is after almost two years of restrictions and closures.“It is no exaggeration to say the hospitality sector has never been in a worse position with over % of trade down from  in food, drink and accommodation sales.“The financial burden of the restrictions are becoming apparent as a growing concern with members responding that the cost of unused stock due to poor footfall and restriction, looming tax bills and the cost of extra staff to monitor Covid- passports and provide table service is having serious strain on business viability.“In fact, some businesses have made the dficult decision to close until restrictions can be lted, having a detrimental impact on trade and staff.” SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also called for a “clear and managed roadmap” out of restrictions.“The success of the vaccination programme and the effort made by people to keep each other safe has put us in a good position to begin planning for the recovery phase of the pandemic. It cannot be dominated by the chaos of the early response,” he said.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender. We must abide by the rules in order we can bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible. There is no other way and we have to remain as safe as possible, he remarked.ldquoI fully appreciate the damage which the pandemic has done to the local economy and I fear that there could be job losses in .ldquoThe business community in Downpatrick and surrounding towns and villages needs help.

It was stated in the original prospectus that motor racing was one of three things which would be looking upon favourably, he explained.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The business community in Ballynahinch has been challenged to press forward with a development plan to take the town into the next century.The challenge made this week by South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, who appealed to local traders to lead the way in the commercial regeneration of the town.Addressing Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce on Monday night, Mr McGrady said it as up to the townrsquos business community to take the initiative and put together a package of measures which would be eligible for substantial grant aid.He told members: ldquoI will try to help in any way I can, but the major thrust of any regeneration of Ballynahinch must come from the people in this room.The SDLP MP said the town must take advantage of ious grant-aided programmes, such as the Department of Environmentrsquos urban development and environmental improvement schemes, which could be used to improve either inidual premises or sections of the town.NEWCASTLE ndash Newcastle Chamber of Commerce has defended its decision to erect just a few Christmas decorations in the town.Fteen illuminated figures were erected along Main Street before Christmas but at the monthly Chamber meeting several traders expressed dissatisfaction at the decorations.Some said the figures were too small and poorly illuminate while others said they looked insignicant when compared with those in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch.However, Chamber President, Mr Peter Law, defended the decorations, saying it was all the group could afford at the time.ldquoThe figures which we purchased cost pound, and there were additional expenses incurred in having them erected, so it was felt we would be better staying within our budge rather than over-reaching ourselves, he said.ldquoI do not think the Chamber would stay in existence very longwe had gone ahead and spent several thousand pounds and later approached the business community for the money, he added.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man who waded chest high in the flooded Moneycarragh River to save the lives of nine sheep is the toast of local farmers.Mr Philip Connor, , De Courcey Way was out exercising his dogs in the afternoon of New Yearrsquos Eve when his attention was drawn to the nearby river by raised voices.Seeing the plight of sheep struggling in the deep water, he raced home to lock up the dogs, which he reckoned would become a nuisance, and came back with a rope to begin a rescue bid as darkness fell.Believing they might have been owned by neighbouring farmer Wilbert Hassard, he had him contracted.He had been told that about a dozen sheep had been driven into the river by two collies. Some of them had become entangled with barbed wire as they crashed through fencing.He described the next half-hour alone in the cold, swirling flood waters as ldquosome wrestling match. But he could not have gone home knowing that they were fighting for their lives.Without his trousers on, but wearing wellington boots to protect his feet, he had to lt some of the trapped animals over two banks to safety.DOWNPATRICK ndash A Downpatrick social club faces the risk of closure following objections to the renewal of its licence.The RUC has formally objected to the renewal of the drinks licence for the Saul Street Social Club.It is understood to be the first objection by police in Down District to a club licence renewal since the new, stronger Registration of Clubs legislation came into force in February .Licence applications for a number of Downrsquos  other licences clubs were formally approve at Downpatrick Magistratesrsquo Court on Thursday.However, when the application by the Saul Street Club was formally called, police lodged an objection.

They are drawn from our century-and-half of operational work, and the lived experiences of those we work with today.We believe adopting these priorities will help to ensure people in crisis get the support they need no matter who or where they are.They are not only achievable, they are essential, and we urge all parties and candidates to incorporate them into their planning for the year ahead and beyond.A world where everyone gets the help they need in a crisis is within our reach onlywe choose it to be.l Sharon Sinclair is area director for British Red Cross, Northern IrelandThe publication British Red Cross Policy Priorities for the next Northern Ireland Executive is available on our website at: www.redcross.org.uk about-us what-we-do we-speak-up-for-change british-red-cross-policy-priorities-for-the-next-northern-ireland-executiveMore from the News Letter:Click here – VIDEO: Huge revamp of Belfast would create miles-long leafy avenue... turn Westlink into tunnel... and make city ‘blue again’ Click here – Wall of silence: Home Office suggests it is dangerous to tell public details about turning Carrickfergus hotel into base for foreign nationals Click here – Criminalising conversion therapy: Northern Ireland must avoid – not mimic – Canada’s new law says transgender writerA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And evenit was, the public could have misread such remarks as meaning they were in great danger, when it became apparent late last month that omicron was having a minor health impact. However, it is welcome to hear Dr Black now speak in a reassuring way, and admit that “our worst expectations haven’t been reached”. The covid crisis is not yet over – there have been too many twists and turns so far to be sure of any scenarios in the near future – but it is at a sufficiently mild level where we cannot tolerate the ruin of certain livelihoods and groups of people.Most society leaders — medical, scientic and political —who have demanded rigid controls are themselves financially untouched by lockdown because they are paid by the state.If lockdown does , the financial burden should be more evenly spread so that there is extra money for sectors such as hospitality. Politicians could show leadership by accepting voluntary pay cuts. But let us hope that it does not .We cannot keep planning for worst case scenarios of virus mutations.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are all focused on our own job of trying to play the best golf we can.”Luke Donald, Henrik Stenson and Robert Karlsson are the frontrunners for the role after Lee Westwood ruled himself out, but when asked who he would like to succeed Padraig Harrington in Rome next year, McIlroy said: “I wouldn’t want to name anyone because I wouldn’t want to influence it one way or another.“There are a number of candidates and they would all do a wonderful job. It’s not just about the one inidual. There’s a lot that goes into it. It’s the vice-captains, the whole Ryder Cup Europe team.

established in response to the coronavirus pandemic is still going strong in Larne.By Helena McManusWednesday, th January , : am  \"       \"  Just some of the projects Larne Area Community Support Group has been involved in since its foundation in March .Larne Area Community Support Group originally formed in March  as a space for friends and family to find help and support, including what was open locally, how to source essential items, and links to useful organisations.Group founder, Lynsey Poole said: “Within the first week we had grown to over , people and became a really positive social media hub for support and signposting.“In , we became a constituted group with a committee to enable us to access funding to support our aims and objectives.Easter treats sourced from Lidl by members of Larne Area Community Support Group were delivered to Lisgarel Nursing Home.“We also linked with Extern, a leading social justice charity as community health and wellbeing champions.”The group currently has six committee members, while its online following has grown to over , people from all age ranges.“We are very inclusive and believe that everyone has a voice to make a positive change where they live, in their own lives and to society as a whole,” explained Lynsey.Positive projectsSince its inception almost two years ago, the group has spearheaded a number of projects, both in Larne and the surrounding area.Their collective efforts led to recognition from then Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Councillor Peter Johnston, who in July  awarded the group for their voluntary services during the pandemic and lockdown.These included assembling breakfast packs at Christmas for families in need with Antrim Coast Vineyard, as well as collaborations with Women’s Aid ABCLN, Horizon Surestart, and Extern Carrick Larne.Through Extern, members created WEcare mental health mood boosting packs for those experiencing hardship or low mood through the pandemic, as well as mental health factsheets on food and mood and lockdown living.A donation of  boxes of school milk that would have went to waste was delivered to older people, children and those shielding in collaboration with Larne community Helping Hands volunteers.The group contributed as editors on Extern’s Larne and Carrick Community Resource Guide.“We also gained funding through Extern’s Community in Transitions project to implement a Community Fridge in the Larne area, which will be in place in Spring  after linking in the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council,” Lynsey said.“Last Christmas we created a Community Advent of Kindness, encouraging people to be kind to one another and linking with local groups and organisations to highlight their events and appeals.“We also had some busking musical sessions and some live music from local musicians.”The group created and distributed over  mental health mood boosting WEcare packs through the pandemic, with the support of Externs Communities in Transition project.Group remains ‘volunteer led’Larne Area Community Support has been involved in numerous positive stories, such as helping to source a replacement bicycle for a young boy whose bike was stolen, and assisting with bringing Easter gts during lockdown to local care homes for their residents.More recently, volunteers were involved in a Kindness Postbox activity between Corran Integrated Primary School and local care homes, sourcing items for people in need.“Our group remains a source of positivity, support and hope through dficult times and we are excited for what is to come,” Lynsey added.“Thegroup remains volunteer led and community led, linking in with other local charities and organisations, with each volunteer able to provide their own skill set and expertise.”As for the future, members are looking forward to more in-person interaction as restrictions ease.  “It will be lovely to have some more face to face activities and events in the new year in collaboration with other charities and organisations we are linked with.“Our main focus for the new year will be our Community Fridge for Larne town, along with hopefully supporting another in the wider Larne area.”LarnePeter JohnstonMayor  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularNew Carrickfergus ‘link’ road given green light by Mid and E...News arrested as police investigate a series of burglaries in

Contact Centres new premisesA centre which aims to facilitate contact between families is moving to a new venue in Carrickfergus town centre.By Helena McManusWednesday, th January , : am  \"       \"  Carrickfergus and Larne Child Contact Centres provides a safe, neutral, and comfortable place for children to see the parent they don’t live with, or sometimes other close family members.It was previously based in the YMCA building before relocating to new premises in nearby West Street, where it is hoped the service will be up and running next month.A registered charity, the centre provides a range of play activities for children aged -, with every family having the opportunity to enjoy safe contact time while being supported by highly trained and skilled volunteers.Volunteers from Carrickfergus and Larne Child Contact Centre pictured at their Christmas lunch in December .Shelly McCord, co-ordinator of the service said: “Our centre would not be able to run without the hard work and ongoing support of our team of volunteers. All volunteers receive regular training and are all vetted through Access NI to ensure their suitability to work with children and young people.“Families get involved in using our centre through the service of a solicitor, family court, or Social Services.”In Northern Ireland, contact centres utilise church halls and similar facilities to facilitate contact sessions. “During the pandemic, the Carrickfergus centre only closed for the first lockdown, and has managed to maintain direct contact for all of our families since June,” Shelly added. “During the lockdown period, indirect contact was maintained for families via our own Zoom facilities, enabling separated families to maintain much needed contact with each other.”Shelly is now hoping to expand the centre to bigger, better facilities, extending availability from limited hours to a six days a week service.The service is relocating to West Street in Carrickfergus town centre.Sensory room also for public useAdditionally, she envisaged the development of a ‘sensory room’, professionally designed and installed, free for public use for families with children who might benefit.Shelly and the centre’s chairperson, Tony Barclay, embarked upon a development project to identy potential costs, location and feasibility of the proposals. In October , whilst researching potential premises,  West Street was identied as a potential option. A former butcher’s shop, the unit had been completely redesigned as offices, a project which had stopped during the pandemic.The trustees of the charity agreed that the project should commence, and a lease for  West Street was signed. Within the centre, facilities are being developed to accommodate children of all ages from birth to  years, including an open play area for younger children a private, secluded room for older children, and – uniquely in any contact centre in NI – a professionally designed and installed sensory room, to be made available not only to service users of the contact centre, but also to other charities working with children who would benefit. The sensory room is also to be made publicly available to any family whose children would benefit from it, at no cost to the family.“We anticipate opening the centre and its facilities in February , once the full fit out is completed,” Shelly said.“We anticipate the sensory room will also open and become publicly available around the same time, bookable for -minute sessions for single families. A booking system is being developed for this purpose. “Our research has identied the existence of other sensory rooms in schools and other facilities across NI, but none which are available publicly – we believe this is the first.”Superb support from local communityThe Contact Centre is partly funded by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and partly by charitable grants.So far, staff have secured £, of funding specically towards the development of the sensory room, although another £, is needed to complete it, including lighting, soft flooring and soundproofing the walls.\"The local community, businesses and iniduals have been superb in supporting us as we move forward, including builders merchants providing materials, the local community coming together to provide equipment, and iniduals providing their own support,\" Shelly continued.\"We have been especially blessed in the form of local resident and businessman Gary Connolly, who has provided a great deal of time and personal effort to build the walls within the new centre, including the Sensory Room, free of charge to us.\"In order to complete the new centre, we need to raise more funds, and furnish the centre with equipment suitable for the families we support. As a registered charity, we provide all of ourservices free of charge to our service users. As well as needing to raise £, to complete the sensory room, we need durable flooring, baby change facilities, accessible toilet handles emergency call system, fire extinguishers, a secure door access system, a small CCTV system, and more.\"We greatly appreciate all the help the local community has offered, as well as the support from the Law Society of NI, who have fully endorsed and are supporting the development of the new centre, which will offer so much to the local community – and possibly much further afield.\"Meanwhile, waiting times for access to a contact centre will be reduced, and possibly even eliminated, with the planned six day opening. \"Families with special needs, including wheelchairusers and those with sensitive children of all ages, will have the opportunity to access a centre designed to meet those needs.\"The fit out of the new premises is already underway. There is still much to do in order to be ready for opening day in February. The charity welcome any and all support, in terms of funding to help us achieve our goals including the sensory room, to provide furniture and toys for all ages from - , and to finish the fit out.\"Shelly McCord can be contacted by email at [email#protected], or by phone at  , while Tony Barclay can be contacted at [email#protected] or by phone at  .CarrickfergusWest StreetNorthern
