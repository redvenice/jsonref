She admitted he can be ‘pretty impatient’ sometimes - and Charles himself freely admits to ‘meddling’ in public affairs (file image taken during a reception at St James\u0027s Palace, London, ahead of a visit to The Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria)In a landmark BBC documentary to mark his 70 years, Charles is portrayed as a man at peace with himself - but with a burning desire to improve the world around him.The filmmakers showed the prince in an arboretum at Birkhall, his Scottish estate.‘This is George’s wood,’ he said, referring to his first grandchild. Charles planted dozens of different tree varieties when George was born five years ago.\u0027Reminds me of Mr Bean!\u0027 Jeremy Corbyn gives the Maybot a...Shocking moment train smashes into lorry on level crossing...Share this articleCharles added: ‘As I get older, all I really long for is to plant trees! I hope it will be quite amusing for George, as they grow up, and he grows up.’Camilla, filmed with her husband among the autumnal red and gold trees after the long dry summer, said he was worried there had not been enough water, joking: ‘He does rain dances most of the day, to try and get some more.’In the BBC film, Charles’s sons added their own touching interpretation of their father’s dedication to causes he believes in - or ‘banging the drum’, as Harry puts it.          Charles says in the documentary: ‘As I get older, all I really long for is to plant trees! I hope it will be quite amusing for George, as they grow up, and he grows up’ (file image taken during a reception at St James\u0027s Palace, London, ahead of his visit to The Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria)The younger prince said of his father: ‘The man never stops.’Harry is said to admire his father’s persistence with issues such as the environment, plastic waste and climate change.‘Whether it’s dinner or tea or whatever and we sit there and speak to him, he gets so frustrated. You can understand why, when he cares that much and he’s been banging the drum for this long,’ Harry said.Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge cited Charles’s devotion to his Prince’s Trust charity, which has helped more than 900,000 young people.    The Prince of Wales meets staff during a visit to the London Ambulance Service HeadquartersWilliam said: ‘One of the things I’m most proud of my father for is the Prince’s Trust. I think what he set up there for young people has been absolutely incredible, and as I go around the country the amount of people who tell me about the Prince’s Trust - I mean, honestly, it’s phenomenal, it really is.’The Prince’s list of passions is exhaustive, from red squirrels, Wagner and Shakespeare to community architecture, corporate social responsibility and a better understanding of Islam.Some have accused Charles of meddling in public affairs, but he bluntly told BBC documentary film-maker John Bridcut: ‘If it’s meddling to worry about the inner cities, as I did 40 years ago, and what was happening, or not happening, there - the conditions in which people were living - if that’s meddling I’m very proud of it.’According to the BBC documentary, Charles - said to be the best-prepared monarch-in-waiting in history - is a workaholic.    The Prince’s list of passions is exhaustive, from red squirrels, Wagner and Shakespeare to community architecture, corporate social responsibility and a better understanding of IslamHe works a seven-day-week, starting at 9am and often finishing after midnight.Last year, he is said to have held 500 ‘business’ meetings behind the scenes, on top of his official engagements.Documentary maker Mr Bridcut told the latest issues of the Radio Times: ‘He paces himself by going for walks, and makes a point of keeping his eyes open, whether counting the orchids in his wildflower meadow, or suddenly yanking a dead branch out of a tree, as he did - with surprising force - on his way to our filmed interview at Highgrove.’He travelled with Charles last November to three Caribbean islands wrecked by hurricanes two months before.Mr Bridcut said: ‘The amazingly cheerful people he met were clearly thrilled to see him.‘All the time he was listening and learning, in the attempt to help small island states improve their resilience to increasingly violent storms, which he believes are the direct result of climate change.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"Amazing photos capture quirkiness everyday British life past decade","story":"    Brighton, August 2018: A seagull swoops down to steal a chip from two terrified girls on Brighton Pier as tourists watch on under the sun in East Sussex.

I think it is at best doubtful.Over the years, Charles has established close working and personal ties with royal Arab leaders. \u0027I was lucky to have known him\u0027: Prince William leads...\u0027Publicity-hungry\u0027 Prince Harry gazumped his father Charles...Share this articleHe is well respected in the Gulf States and Middle East, not least for his sympathetic speeches about Islam. Like Blair, he studied the Koran in depth and has even, over years, learned Arabic.When corresponding with Arab leaders he always signs his name in Arabic, another small nod to respecting the other culture. Indeed, he thinks Islam can teach us all a way of understanding and living in the world, which sadly, he believes, Christianity is poorer for having lost.Prince Charles believes that, by shackling Britain to the flawed Bush administration, Tony Blair missed a golden opportunity to forge an alternative consensus, one that both secured the crucial support of Arab leaders and embraced their unique perspective and understanding of the often troubled region.Privately, he castigated both President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Blair\u0027s combative role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 2003 military invasion of Iraq.          The prince was diametrically opposed to the Blair–Bush Iraq War strategy. He believed that, by shackling Britain to the flawed Bush administration, Tony Blair missed a golden opportunity to forge an alternative consensusHis views did not come with hindsight. Charles made his no-nonsense position clear to those in power at the time.He told political figures and those in his trusted circle that he regarded the Bush Administration as \u0027terrifying\u0027 and pilloried what he believes was Blair\u0027s lack of perspicacity. He believed Blair had behaved like Bush\u0027s \u0027poodle\u0027 and said so.One of his circle revealed: \u0027Whenever he followed in the wake of the Prime Minister on an overseas visit he would quote a phrase dryly, \u0027Thou shalt go behind the rear of the Lord to declare his song.\u0027 It would always get a laugh.\u0027Indeed, the Prince of Wales cast serious doubt on the government\u0027s 2002 intelligence dossier long before the BBC report in May 2003 that it had been \u0027sexed up\u0027.           Prince Charles told political figures and those in his trusted circle that he regarded the Bush Administration as \u0027terrifying\u0027As for George W. Bush, Charles believed the president \u0027lacked intelligence\u0027 and said Bush would always remain a \u0027mystery\u0027 to him.On Blair, the Prince was even more condemnatory. With a heavy dollop of irony, he scornfully dubbed the premier \u0027our magnificent leader\u0027 whenever talking about him in private and derided him for ignoring the wealth of sound intelligence available to him at the time that contradicted the American view.Charles repeatedly told friends that Blair should have listened to Arab leaders about how to act over Iraq.The Arab rulers had told him again and again how uneasy they were about Blair becoming so closely aligned with Bush and how \u0027bewildered and saddened\u0027 they were by the UK\u0027s position in being \u0027tied to the USA\u0027s coat-tails\u0027 over Iraq. Charles asked one high-level source damningly: \u0027Why did Mr Blair do it, despite what they must all have been telling him before the conflict about the dangers of stirring the hornets\u0027 nest up in this part of the world?\u0027          The Prince of Wales (pictured with sons William and Harry) repeatedly told friends that Blair should have listened to Arab leaders about how to act over Iraq\u0027The Prince,\u0027 one senior source and former member of the Royal Household said, \u0027had a very clear position on the West\u0027s so-called democratisation of Iraq and the region, based on years of study and conversations with leaders there.\u0027HRH did try very hard to engage senior figures on this, but nobody in government wanted to listen to a word he said. Their minds were made up.\u0027When given the opportunity, the Prince would point out why the delicate differences in culture in the region were crucial to understand. It was a region dominated by tribal loyalties, and still is. So marching in carrying a banner for Western-style democracy was both foolhardy and futile.One of the Prince\u0027s circle, who was fully aware of his views at the time, said: \u0027The Prince was wise enough to foresee that. Why weren\u0027t the politicians of the day?\u0027The 2003 invasion of Iraq lasted from March 20 to May 1. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Charles found the United States and United Kingdom government \u0027solutions\u0027 to be both naive and inept.The Prince privately questioned the legitimacy of so-called \u0027democratic elections\u0027 that followed when it was happening against a background of intimidation, violence and inter-tribal feuding.One impeccable source said: \u0027Around this time the Prince grew increasingly frustrated with the Iraq issue. It left him deeply depressed.\u0027 Another informed source told me: \u0027I remember one evening when the Boss was particularly animated on this subject.\u0027He was very critical of the Bush administration and the President in particular, saying that he felt our children\u0027s futures appear to be in the hands of what he described as an \u0027awful\u0027 administration and it absolutely terrified him. He just didn\u0027t trust them one bit.\u0027          According to sources, the Prince (pictured at Balmoral Castle) thought it was \u0027absolutely extraordinary\u0027 that neither the Americans nor those in authority in the UK ever seemed to listen to the Arab perspectiveThe Prince, according to sources, maintained it was \u0027absolutely extraordinary\u0027 that neither the Americans nor those in authority in the UK ever seemed to listen to the Arab perspective or consider their knowledge of Iraq and its religious and tribal complexities when seeking postwar solutions there.Ignoring their perspective, the Prince felt, was fatal and had led to what he described as \u0027the bewildering mess we are facing now at home and abroad\u0027.One former member of the Prince\u0027s household ulged that Charles was completely baffled by Bush and his stance in totally ignoring the advice of local leaders.\u0027The Prince could not understand the sense in America\u0027s position,\u0027 the source said, \u0027which was a need to revisit the \u0027crazy\u0027 de-Baathifican policy (sacking professionals who were members of Saddam Hussein\u0027s B\u0027aath party) that had led to the exclusion of so many badly needed professional people throughout Iraqi society and turned so many people against the coalition.\u0027Charles, the source said, was particularly derogatory about Bush\u0027s Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice — the first black woman to hold that post — and the extent of what he deemed U.S. ignorance of the Middle East. The Prince couldn\u0027t fathom why Ms Rice resisted all requests to visit the area.And some of her statements left him cold, such as: \u0027The people of the Middle East share the desire for freedom. We have an opportunity — and an obligation — to help them turn this desire into reality.\u0027\u0027But what does that actually mean and how on earth were they going to implement it?\u0027 he would question.In the Prince\u0027s view, the only way proper democracy will ever be achieved in Iraq, and the West will stand any chance of winning the war on terror is by dealing with the \u0027real toxin\u0027 infecting the whole world: the Israel– Palestine question.He maintains that the West must also focus on education and resisting what he believes is a \u0027terrible distortion\u0027 of Islam and how it is perceived.Only then, he believes —when the wider world embraces the real Islam, combined with a serious collaborative effort to find a workable solution to the Israel–Palestine question — will the rage that drives the war on terror start to wane.            Prince Charles and Princess Diana leave Gibraltar on the Royal Yacht Britannia for their honeymoon cruise in 1981. Prince Charles still keenly misses the royal yacht, which was decommissioned in 1997He pointed out that on his 2018 Australian tour he’d convened a round-table meeting with big-business CEOs to examine the challenges faced by the world’s ocean reefs. Yet senior representatives from Australia’s mining industry had failed to show up, and other industry leaders had sent more junior executives to represent them.Charles was clearly a little peeved, reflecting that this wouldn’t have happened if the meeting had been aboard Britannia. Whenever she was due in port, the British Ambassador — who advised on invitations — was suddenly the most popular person in the entire country, he said.

The wave generator produces a single large concentric wave which radiates outwards. When this wave intersects each reef, a wave breaks and runs the length of the reef before dissipating on the shoreline. Up to six waves sets can be run with a short break in between. The waves will vary in size from 1m (3ft) to 2.4m (8ft) face height, catering for beginner to advanced surfers simultaneously. According to Surf Lake’s website, the pool is capable of generating one pulse every six seconds, causing four a-framing peaks (eight waves in total) to break. That means 80 rideable waves per minute, and in use the system will make 2,4000 waves per hour (allowing the displaced water to re-enter the system).           The world-first technology has the highest wave productivity as hundreds of surfers are able to catch up to ten waves each per hour          The five different levels of waves will vary in of difficulty, size, and lengthThe wave pool relies on a giant plunger positioned at its center, which generates one pulse every six seconds to send the water rippling 360 degrees around.At this rate, the plunger is capable of creating 80 rideable waves per minute, or 4800 waves per hour, according to Magicseaweed.For now though, it will be kept at a rate of 2,400 waves per hour.          The facility near near Yeppoon on Queensland\u0027s Capricorn Coast is expected to open soonThe wave pool can fit a capacity of up to 240 surfers and learners each hour with different abilities, which avoids the problem of waiting for different sessions to run.The world-first technology has the highest wave productivity as hundreds of surfers are able to catch up to ten waves each per hour.          Surfers will be able to test the pools\u0027 \u00275 wave\u0027 technology, which produces five different levels of waves simultaneously around the lake          Surfing legend Mark Occhilupo has already given the facility the thumbs upA variety of waves can accommodate for a range of watercraft.Intermediate waves are suitable for short boards, long boards, stand-up paddleboarding and surf skis.Advanced and expert waves are suitable for short boards and knee boards.Australia\u0027s first man-made surfing wave pool was founded by Aaron Trevis, part of the Surf Lakes team. PhD engineer and Surf Lakes Director Chris Hawley oversaw the build and design of the pool.The project was funded by private investors and finance expert and fellow Director Reuben Buchanan.

The 75-tonne whales are sacred to Inupiat people, who cook and eat three per year, leaving the bones in a designated place for the polar bears to finish off the scraps of meat stuck to the bones Photographer Eiji Itoyama spent five days in Kaktovik village, Alaska, which is on the edge of the Arctic Ocean, taking pictures of the bears, which are around a year old.The 48-year-old from Osaka, Japan, said the Inupiat people are only allowed to hunt three bowhead whales per year, which can reach up to 60ft in length, leaving the carcass out on the ice for the bears to eat the leftovers.He said: The local people called Inupiat are allowed to hunt three bowhead whales every year and they put the remains in a certain place every time for polar bears to eat the rest of whale meat.Basically, polar bears love playing, especially the cubs.Their curiosity drew them to these whale bones. They pushed them around, pulled at them, trying to climb up, and were play-fighting over the bone.The cubs follow their mother over the ice, but sometimes they find something interesting or something they need to check out.The mother polar bears that I saw were very tolerant - this one was waiting until her cubs finished their game, as long as she felt it is safe for them.The bone piles are a central place to find polar bears in Kaktovik.They hang around the bone piles and I saw lots of mothers and cubs during the morning and evening times.Even though most of bones are years old and have been left there from previous years, they still attract bears with left-over old meat.The cubs easily spent more than half an hour playing with the bones before the family moved on.          Photographer Eiji Itoyama said: \u0027Even though most of bones are years old and have been left there from previous years, they still attract bears with left-over old meat.          \u0027The cubs follow their mother over the ice, but sometimes they find something interesting or something they need to check out,\u0027 Itoyama added          I had such a smile on my face while I was taking photos. The cubs were so cute and I completely forgot that polar bears are dangerous animals.I heard from the local people that there are around 30 polar bears in Kaktovik this year.It was 70 last year and I wonder why they are so few this year, maybe an environmental reason. I am not sure.But, the bears I saw during my stay are all peaceful and looked healthy, even though there is not a lot of food at this time of year.October is still early for polar bears to hunt seals because the sea water is not frozen yet and it does not allow for them to walk on the ice to find seals in breathing holes in the ice.For now, they are forced to eat carcasses of seagulls, seal, and whale until they start hunting. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/29/20/51C62E7100000578-0-image-a-35_1540844314303.jpg","title":"Venice starts recover perfect storm left three quarters city water","story":"The owners of Caffe Florian, in St Mark\u0027s Square in Venice, began bailing out floodwater on Tuesday (left) a day after three quarters of the city was submerged, causing the historic square to close (right, debris washed up in the storm)          Caffe Florian, which has claim to being Europe\u0027s oldest coffee shop having stood in St Mark\u0027s square since 1720, saw its floors and furniture damaged by floodwater on Monday          Shopkeepers around St Mark\u0027s Square also scrambled to reopen their businesses on Monday as the floodwaters subsided in the hopes of drawing more tourists in          Tables, chairs and decking outside the prestigious London hotel in St Mark\u0027s square was deserted on Tuesday having been largely wrecked during flooding the previous day          While bad weather was due to continue in Venice on Tuesday, only eight per cent of the city was due to remain underwater, allowing business owners time to repair the damage (pictured, the London hotel in St Mark\u0027s Square)          A \u0027bricola sign brought down by overnight storms in Venice floats in one of the city\u0027s canals on TuesdayShocking moment man is punched outside chicken shop and left to dieFootage taken just minutes before fatal Leicester helicopter crashRebekah and Jamie Vardy weep as they visit Leicester sea of flowersHilarious moment Liz Truss accidentally sits on MPs in the CommonsPassengers on cruise taking on water furious over communicationPolice search Suzy Lamplugh\u0027s body in John Cannan\u0027s mother\u0027s gardenSport presenter makes off-mic comments at Leicester memorialChris Kamara holds back tears during tribute to Leicester ownerBritish swimming star Tazmin Pugh shares fun moment from her trainingA Brisbane woman has been jailed for killing her rapistPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at reception with New Zealand PM\u0027It was the perfect storm during which adverse meteorological conditions contributed to the situation in the sea and winds,\u0027 civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said. Venice was not the only part of Italy to be badly impacted by severe weather, which killed 11 people across the country, largely in the north.The majority of those deaths happened when cars were hit by falling trees, but one fatality was caused by a landslide in Trento, while a windsurfer died after being slammed into rocks in Emilia-Romagna.Flooding also impacted the city of Rapello, in the north west, when breakwater walls surrounding the Carlo Riva marina burst, causing  water to surge through.The surge overwhelmed many of the expensive yachts moored there, either partially sinking them or smashing them against nearby rocks, where they were stranded high and dry.Among them was a £5.3million, 120ft yacht belonging to Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s son Pier, the Seguno, which was photographed over on its side and half submerged in the water. Spooky SKULL rises from the deep in stunning shot of an icy...Typhoon Yutu smashes into the Philippines, with 95mph winds...Russia\u0027s only aircraft carrier is damaged when floating dock...Share this articleExtreme weather was expected to continue across the north on Tuesday, though only eight per cent of Venice was expected to remain underwater by the end of the day - thwarting predictions made on Monday that it could be the worst to ever hit the city.Italy\u0027s Civil Protection agency declared the highest alert possible in several northern regions on Tuesday, while an orange alert, the second highest on the scale, was issued for the central regions of Abruzzo and Lazio - which includes the capital Rome - where gale-force winds topped 100 kph on Monday. The national fire brigade said it had intervened in 7,000 cases across the country and that one of its staff had died, crushed by a tree during a rescue operation in a small town in South Tyrol.Nonetheless, the main highways across the country were open, with closures only on secondary roads.The weather was expected to improve from the late afternoon, \u0027giving the country a truce\u0027 an official from the civil protection agency told Reuters.

New Guinea was connected by land to Australia until about 10,000 years ago, meaning the first people could walk down through what is now Cape York to the rest of the continent.Kealy also tracked other factors, like whether a particular route would involve going over or around a hill, in order to determine the most likely path of travel.“We are looking at the first sea journey of our species,” she said.The route follows roughly the same path as the northern route described by US anthropologist Joseph Birdsell in 1977, who theorised two likely paths that have been largely accepted and used as a model for researchers.Birdsell’s northern route goes through Sulawesi to West Papua and the southern route goes through Timor and ends with a significant sea crossing to the Northern Territory or Kimberley coastline.Archeologists have since found a number of sites in East Timor that show proof of human occupation, but none are older than 45,000 years old.Artefacts from the oldest known site in Australia, a rock shelter at Madjedbebe in the Jabiluka mining lease within the Kakadu national park, on Mirarr country, have been dated at 65,000 years old.A site on Barrow Island off the coast of Western Australia has been dated at 50,000 years old.“Obviously people had to travel through these islands somehow to get to Australia so presumably the dates that we found in Australia should be younger or around the same age as the dates that we are getting from these East Timor sites,” Kealy said.The fact that those sites are significantly younger, she said, suggests that maybe the first peoples took a different path.Islands along Birdsell’s northern route have received comparatively little archeological attention due to isolation, expense, and political conflict in West Papua.Kealy and co-author Prof Sue O’Connor, are applying for research grants to investigate some likely sites along the northern route next year.“If we can find something that’s older than 60,000 years old, I would be super-dooper happy,” she said.The timeframe of 65,000 plus years is not universally accepted in the academic community. Another recent study asserted 50,000 to 55,000 years was the most likely timeframe but Kealy said her modelling tracked changes in both coastline and sea level from 45,000 to 70,000 years ago.The sea level was at its lowest point 65,000 years ago and highest 70,000 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b5df31c054b9ded4ab1fbf8bfc09a1be93505d/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=529ad4dbf011ad91e47fa8e076211028","title":"martin amis london fields film amber heard interview","story":"As the troubled adaptation finally hits screens to negative reviews and bad box office, the author talks about the difficult journey from page to screenHollywood fiascos of this caliber come once or twice a decade.After over 15 years of assorted delays, a big-screen adaptation of Martin Amis’s murder-mystery novel London Fields arrived in US theaters at the weekend. David Cronenberg was attached to the earliest phases of the project in 2001, replaced by a series of decreasingly prestigious film-makers that has led to Katy Perry music video veteran Matthew Cullen. Cullen prepared a cut of the film for the Toronto film festival in 2015, but was decidedly displeased to discover that the producers had re-edited the film for exhibition on the festival circuit. He sued over the rights to final cut privileges along with fraud and failure to provide payment, and the production team countersued over his contractually prohibited choice to pursue side jobs while working on London Fields.As soon as that had been settled, the producers brought new litigation against star Amber Heard for reneging on her voiceover commitments, which she met with a competing lawsuit over a mishandled nudity clause. Everybody reached a settlement this past September, et voilà: London Fields was ready for the world.So you’ve seen the film then?Yes, but first, a few principles. It’s wise for an author to withdraw from things like this, and while I’m not saying I’m not going to talk, you should put some distance between the books you write and films made from them. Everyone tries to do this, because it’s futile to hope for a transfer of your work on to the screen in one piece. Film is about exteriors and fiction is about interiors, usually. Having said all that, I found it surprisingly faithful in many ways. It certainly doesn’t go off on a tangent. It’s toilingly faithful, by my standard.But yes, I saw it last for the third time, having seen the producer’s cut and the director’s cut. I have to say that I was quite moved by it. I thought the central relationship was moving, between Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton, both very strong actors. That’s the kernel of the book, and same with the film.Did you notice any significant differences between the various edits that have been assembled for this film?I can’t say that I did, though I saw the previous version two or three years ago, so it’s a bit faint in my mind. But everything in the new cut looked familiar, so I can hardly remember what all the argument was over. I think it was the ending? All I know is that the cast was very much against the producer’s cut.Having completed your contribution to the production itself, did you have a detached perspective during all of the legal troubles that befell the release? Or did you find yourself getting invested anyway?Apart from wishing that it wasn’t going on, that things had gone more smoothly for the film, I didn’t have much of an opinion on the course of events. I’m glad that they’ve sorted it out enough that they can show it to the public instead of just trotting it out at festivals.As London Fields has entered public release this weekend, the notices have been largely negative and box-office receipts are looking dismal. Do you have any ideas as to what this could be ascribed?Not really. The film is rather confusing as it opens, and it could’ve done with a lot more clarity in its first half or so. That’s all I can say. I mean, I never thought it would be a popular film.London Fields has a reputation as one of those “unfilmable” novels. What does that word mean to you? What makes a book impossible to adapt?Given enough imagination, I don’t think any novel is really unfilmable. I mentioned Cronenberg before, and he’s got a reputation for adapting supposedly unadaptable books like Crash and Naked Lunch, because he found a way in both cases. I don’t think there’s anything particularly unfilmable about London Fields.I had been thinking that this particular novel is both a story in the noir tradition and deconstructive of that same genre, which could be difficult to represent in a visual medium. Do you see a challenge in distinguishing between the two without a guiding authorial voice?I think you’re right, and I’m surprised by how much of that made it into the film. Same with Money, which was made into a two-hour TV thing, and they got rid of most of the postmodern aspects. Postmodernism has started to look a bit antique, in my view. The movement had great predictive power, as we’ve seen life becoming increasingly postmodern in many aspects, but it hasn’t always transferred as literature. Though Harold Pinter wrote the film adaptation of The French Lieutenant’s Woman and found a way of doing it where you could see the cast both as actors and in their roles, which seemed to be a clever equivalent to postmodernism. Whether that made the film more watchable – well, I don’t think it is.If postmodernism is in decline, by what has it been supplanted?It’s been put aside, as an interesting digression. Social realism has come barging back in, certainly with the novel. Most of the innovations of the 20th century, stream-of-consciousness in particular, have petered out in fiction. Fiction’s a social form, a coherent form, a rational form. These experiments of the past haven’t had much stamina.Nuclear anxiety figures prominently into London Fields, something that’s only grown more urgent in the years since the novel’s publication, even since the film’s completion in 2015. With the States now hurtling toward the apocalypse, have you reappraised the story at all?Yes, I have, though I’m surprised to hear you say it’s grown more urgent. I wrote the novel at the end of the 80s, during the Reagan buildup that won the cold war. We went from the era of mutually assured destruction to the era of nuclear proliferation, and I think we’ve now entered another era. Despite Trump messing around with the treaties and having a soft spot for nuclear weaponry, the gravest threat is now the rogue nuclear weapon – this idea that a terrorist operating independent of a state apparatus could take control of a warhead. That’s not quite as urgent as mutually assured destruction, which promised the end of everything. That was to be the end of civilization, and I don’t think anyone’s worried about that at the moment.Really? I feel as if I’ve always got enough time to worry about the end of civilization.Civilization is in better shape than people think. More than optimism, that’s just the rational response. Availability bias means that what you see in the media tends to point one way, but it’s actually an illusion. Things have, in a grand sense, gotten better. People look at you incredulously when you say it, but it’s all data-driven. Political people tend to live on restless extremes, and don’t see the finer lines that undergird progress.I had a talk about this with Ian McEwan many years ago, and we agreed that it’s easy to be dark. They say happiness writes light and darkness writes dark the words just show up on the page. In fact, it’s a great challenge to write a novel with characters that are good people. Dickens never wrote a good character, he wrote about eccentrics and villains and contemptibles.One of the most popular criticisms I’ve seen levelled against the adaptation of London Fields concerns the Nicola Six character, that she’s nothing more than the male fetish object Billy Bob Thornton’s character described her as.It’s a criticism I’m very familiar with. All it really means, I think, is that she’s pretty. Since the question is met head-on in the film and in the book, I tend to sort of shrug it off. The question of sexual attractiveness is invidious, you know? It’s likely to cause resentment, and if you write about sexually charismatic figures, you’re going to run into trouble. But we all know they exist, and that they account for much human motive and action.I suppose that this is part of the hazard of adaptation, that you’ve got no control over how the camera treats her, whether the cinematography makes an object of her. Do you feel that your work gets away from you when someone else adapts it? If so, does that cause any consternation?I think that, by definition, it does. But my work isn’t adapted often enough for serious consternation. When it’s suggested that a book of mine be made into a film, I always say, ‘Take it away, I don’t want to have any control over it. It’s yours now, do what you will with it.’ Life really is too short to worry about the secondary may-offends, you just focus on your end of it.There’s been a pattern of troubles in past treatments of your work – adaptations of Dead Babies and The Rachel Papers were critically lambasted, and the film version of Money couldn’t even come together. Is there something intrinsically tricky to translate in your writing?Hm, I suppose there must be, on empirical evidence alone. But I don’t really see it myself. There’s a way of doing anything, nothing’s intractable. Maybe there just hasn’t been a successful one yet. I thought The Rachel Papers was actually pretty palatable. But, uh, we’ll see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e697b320277c2d0d57bb5ebefc124b8f1a6c2a54/0_193_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edaad50c5c3aa8c6586fc91b7b9e768d","title":"universal credit could silence working class writers mps told","story":"All-party inquiry into authors’ incomes hears new benefit’s rules could mean only the wealthy will write. Meanwhile booksellers welcomed budget business-rate changesMPs have been warned that the rollout of universal credit championed in Monday’s budget will further undermine professional writers’ falling incomes. As a result, authors such as 2018 Man Booker prize winner Anna Burns, JK Rowling and Sarah Waters, all of whom relied on benefits to write their breakout bestsellers, would be unable to write full-time unless they had an alternative income.In the acknowledgments to her winning novel, Milkman, Burns thanked her local food bank, various charities and benefits from the Department for Work and Pensions for support that enabled her to write the book.Speaking to a cross-party inquiry into authors’ incomes on Tuesday, the Society of Authors’ chief executive Nicola Solomon said at a time when writers’ ability to earn a living from their work was under unprecedented threat, changes to how benefits were calculated left them vulnerable.New rules demand that the self-employed prove they are in businesses “with a view to achieving a profit”, but Solomon said that the nature of professional writers’ earnings, which fluctuate from month to month, meant it was hard to prove they were commercial enterprises.Writers’ unstable incomes also meant they might not reach the “minimum income floor” above which universal credit is paid. Solomon said: “We have a benefits system that doesn’t understand how writers work and now the minimum income floor means that authors may be cut out of the benefits system entirely.”For those who argue that writing is a privilege rather than a profession, Solomon said: “If writing is a privilege then only the privileged will be able to afford to write, and that gives us an incredibly narrow group of people writing about the same group of people that are reading their books.”She added: “It boils down to a question of whether you think that a working-class woman like Anna Burns should be able to write.”Authors’ struggles to earn a living wage were heard as part of a submission to an inquiry into writers’ incomes launched by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Writers. The submissions were heard after chancellor Philip Hammond announced a raft of other measures that were welcomed by the book industry. These included a cut to business rates that offers a lifeline to struggling independent bookshops.Waterstones managing director James Daunt said that although his business would not gain from a cut that sees a third lopped off rates bills for high-street businesses with a turnover of £51,000 or less, the move would ensure booksellers could compete more effectively with online rivals, the biggest of whom pay little or no tax in the UK.Describing the proportional imbalance of taxes paid by the likes of Amazon compared to small retailers as iniquitous, he said the issue should have been addressed when the economy was in better shape and not under threat from a hard Brexit. “George Osborne should have done this,” he said. “While the sun is shining you should fix the roof. Hammond has gone up there with a bit of plastic to cover the holes as a very black storm threatens.”According to the trade magazine the Bookseller, retailers greeted the news with a mix of surprise and joy. Judy Brook, owner of Kenilworth Books in Warwickshire, told the magazine: “This has got to be a good thing in helping us compete with online sellers and compete with other retailers on the high street.” While Louise Chadwick of Button and Bear bookshop in Shrewsbury said: “We are delighted that the budget is recognising the value of the high street and giving some much-needed support to businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538b6c45a1a764c6dd252583e2c272980bbe8417/0_522_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede4f2cd3f24602d3a5f048f02e7b202","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The same crew awarded gold stars to many billions-worth of US sub-prime debt that turned out to be crud. Equally, however, rating agencies survived that fiasco a decade ago because financial markets tend to value the views of outsiders who take a cold look at financial risks and offer a detached opinion. It is why S\u0026ampP Global’s warning that a no-deal Brexit would cause a long, if “moderate”, recession in the UK should be taken at face value. This is not Project Fear. It is a sober assessment of the odds.S\u0026ampP also starts from the reasonable premise that the UK policymakers would do their best to limit the damage. The Bank of England, it expects, would ignore temporarily higher inflation and cut interest rates to zero and possibly start buying corporate bonds to stimulate the economy. S\u0026ampP also expects the UK and EU to put in place “at least some safeguarding measures”.Like “cliff edge”, except worse.

That’s hardly news but it does put Monday’s budget into context. In a no-deal outcome, you can ignore almost everything chancellor Philip Hammond said.The silliest detail within the Restaurant Group’s announcement of its £559m purchase of Wagamama wasn’t the claim that the incoming business appeals to customers across different “day parts”. That’s just hideous management-speak for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The worse offence, championed in the opening paragraph, was the buyer’s boast that it is paying a multiple of only 8.7 times Wagamama’s top-line earnings in the past year.If 8.7 was a clean figure, Restaurant Group might be getting a bargain. But it’s not. Wagamama made earnings before interest, tax and depreciation last year of £43m, so an enterprise value of £559m equates to exactly 13 times, which looks expensive by normal yardsticks for valuing mass-market restaurant chains.Restaurant Group gets to its 8.7 figure by including “cost and site conversion synergies” – in other words, stuff that hasn’t yet happened and will not arrive for free. It’s a bizarre way to present the figures. The elaborate dance won’t fool any investor, so in that sense it is harmless, but why bother? Management looks defensive from the off.Maybe it will work out happily. Certainly, Wagamama’s recent sales growth has been vastly superior to that produced by the most of the brands within Restaurant Group. Pan-Asian food may be a long-term market worth pursuing. Yet Wagamama has been through private equity’s lean-and-mean model for the past seven years and the seller, Duke Street, says the £559m price-tag means it will have made 3.4 times its money. That doesn’t obviously leave much on the table for the next owner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65464bd43e93c5025f204ad7bb9466191072976c/0_96_5214_3128/master/5214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18893ead4e06d4effecb517047c314cd","title":"leicester city owner vichai srivaddhanaprabha","story":"Football and race have always made uncomfortable bedfellows. My first piece of journalism, from when I was 13, was about the Let’s Kick Racism Out of Football campaign (now known as Kick It Out), which launched in 1993. More lasting than the impression the campaign itself left on my young mind – as relayed to me by the QPR players I interviewed back then – were the experiences of racism that motivated its creation. I’m still yet to meet a black football fan from that era who doesn’t have a heartbreaking story of being abused: not by the other side, but by supporters of their own team.Since then racism has changed. The need to end it is agreed by everyone in any official position, bar the odd American president.October is now celebrated as Black History Month, even by a Conservative prime minister who in recent memory was deporting black Brits. There have even been attempts to make the England flag marginally less scary after decades during which it symbolised not the inclusion of black people in this country but the continuing threat to their safety from the far right.The far right has changed too. I was more or less tolerated on an English Defence League march (I was there as a journalist) because, although I’m black, I’m not Muslim, and so am marginally more bearable. And just at the moment when nativism and imperial nostalgia have taken hold of politics, we are capable of a huge, united show of loss for a foreigner of a different race and language with – dare I say it – a hard-to-pronounce name.It’s one of the many tragedies about the helicopter crash, which killed five people outside Leicester City’s stadium, that it took their deaths for most of us to know anything about their lives.

His surname was an honour bestowed by the former king of Thailand in recognition of all he had given back to his nation from his wealth – it means “light of progressive glory”.It seems the affection for him in Thailand was matched in Leicester, because after rescuing the ailing club in 2010 he led it to a fairytale Premier League triumph in 2016. Right now, as England faces an unprecedented wave of hate crimes against people from visible ethnic and religious minorities, and feels gripped from top to bottom by anti-immigrant sentiment, here was a migrant who was truly loved.Only here’s the thing: apparently that is a bad thing to say. According to many of those mourning Srivaddhanaprabha on social media – and there are many – to point out that he was Thai, that he had a different heritage, faith and language and yet they loved him, is very offensive. It’s a particular offence of “mentioning someone’s race when they were actually a really good person”. There is a positive side to the appearance of this new offence – consistent awareness of which across Twitter Britain has, I must admit, taken me by surprise. This is that people who are no friends of antiracism are perfectly capable of seeing someone from a different race as “one of them”. They are perfectly capable of embracing migrants. They can revere and hold up someone who was born poor in Bangkok as a part of their own family – sentiments on ample display in the recent outpourings of genuine grief.I say they are no friends of antiracism because on social media they’ve been pretty damned quick to throw racial slurs my way. But I guess that’s because I’m bad: bad immigrant, ungrateful woman. One person went so far as to tell me his country had given me shelter and a passport, and I should conduct myself accordingly.In the past, I thought the problem in Britain was that race was something we chose not to see. And, as should be self-evident, “not seeing” something is unlikely to facilitate a sophisticated analysis of it. But the problem is becoming more complicated.But Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha did not have a race, because he was good. Deracialising him – an honour reserved for the “good” immigrant – is a final benevolent gift of thanks that the people trolling me this week can give him.This is not to speak ill of Srivaddhanaprabha in any way. On the contrary. His death is a terrible loss. The accident was devastating. But it’s clear that some people, such as those on social media, think calling someone an immigrant is an insult, whereas I don’t.And by ignoring the heritage of an outsider thriving in Britain, people seem able to continue to demonise migrants as a group while celebrating the few they find useful. That is precisely how things do not change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccbbe13f721df860ad4b8df19edc28dd20784ff3/0_53_2256_1353/master/2256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3a5a2145faaa14a7767d00a2c2a16ec","title":"new 50p brexit british coins europe","story":"“Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”: what a curious motto for the new 50p coin that the Treasury has announced will commemorate Britain’s exit from the European Union. It has an air of playground desperation about it – the neediness of a kid who, having wilfully pissed off all 27 of his friends, is slinking nervously back into the schoolyard looking for someone – anyone – to play with.It will not be the first time that Britain’s relationship with Europe has been marked on its coinage. Commemorative 50p pieces were struck in 1973 when Britain joined the European Economic Community, and in 1998 to mark the UK’s presidency of the EU. But you could argue that the neatest parallel to the Brexit coin goes back almost two millennia, to the third century AD and the first, dramatic Brexit – under Britain’s breakaway Roman emperor, Carausius.A Roman officer from modern Netherlands, Carausius was given command of a fleet whose job was to rid the Channel of Saxon raiders. But, accused of colluding with the pirates, he was sentenced to death. His response, in about AD 286 or 287, was to seize control of the Roman province of Britannia, along with a chunk of France around Boulogne.Precisely what was really going on here is hard to unpick there is hardly anything to go on in the historical record (a fact that probably helped rather than hindered the writer Rosemary Sutcliff in fleshing out a wonderfully compelling account in her children’s book The Silver Branch). But there are strong clues in the distinctive, highly suggestive coins Carausius struck. One declared him “the restorer of Britain”, another “spirit of Britain”. Another was inscribed with words that translate as “Come, awaited one” – an adaptation of a phrase from Virgil. Another had an image of Romulus and Remus suckled by the she-wolf – the great, resonant image of Rome’s mythical origins – with the inscription, “the restorer of the Romans”, along with the rather enigmatic initials RSR. Carausius was claiming to hark back to a better, stronger age.For years no one had a clue what the letters RSR or INPCDA alluded to. Then, in 1997, it suddenly occurred to the writer and broadcaster Guy de la Bédoyère – while running a bath for his children – that they could perhaps be something to do with Virgil. On the offchance, he flicked through the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. And there the letters were, right in front of him. RSR stands for redeunt saturnia regna, or “the Golden Age returns” INPCDA for iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto – “now a new progeny is sent from heaven”. Together, they are the most famous line and a half of Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue – an ecstatic poem foretelling the start of a glorious new era.Carausius’s “Brexit” coins, then, can plausibly be seen as a claim that he will preside over the rebirth of Britain – coupled with a bold, not to say shameless, assertion of legitimacy. (By pure chance, until the round British pound coin was replaced with a dodecagonal version last year, it also had a quotation from Virgil inscribed on its rim – decus et tutamen, meaning shield and protection, which comes from the Aeneid.)It strikes me that the leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson, for one, might like nothing better than to have himself minted on to a coin wearing a toga and surrounded by quotations from Virgil announcing him the harbinger of a new golden age. But the rest of the story might put leavers off a bit. In around 293 Carausius was assassinated by a shadowy figure called Allectus, who assumed control of Britannia. And then, in 296, the general Constantinus Chlorus arrived with troops and brought the province back into the empire (he was the father of Constantine the Great, proclaimed emperor in York a decade later). Britain’s first Brexit, as far as we can tell, was a short-lived and unhappy affair – whatever the coins might have claimed.• Charlotte Higgins is the ’s chief culture writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68776de8fcd9f62e9d9f4e7f105c582178941120/0_0_3221_1932/master/3221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dbbd07f22da7e73f9dfb27848bda122","title":"no deal brexit not end negotiations eu","story":"The shock of crashing out of Europe would bring the UK back to the table quickly – so member states are willing to stand firmThe UK Brexit debate has consistently misread the EU’s aims, and its determination to pursue them. We are now at risk of doing so over the negotiating endgame. No deal, if it happens, will be a process – not an event – managed by the EU to their negotiating advantage, just as the article 50 talks have been throughout. The difference is that a no-deal process would be much shorter and more brutal for the UK.The Brexit debate in the UK often misses the very modern political motivations of the EU27. Yes, they are determined to defend the rules-based single market, built up through decades of compromise. But leading EU member states have a political aim closer to home they must defeat the idea of a painless Brexit. Otherwise, they fear, the European parliament elections next June will be dominated by their own populist opponents, who will claim that they, too, can shed the obligations but keep the benefits of EU membership.The UK’s bruising experience in the Brexit negotiations, and the likely outcome, may have already made the point clearly enough. But if British politics remains stuck on demanding the impossible, as the EU see it, no deal can also become a process to make the message crystal clear.Some key EU governments think that a “managed” no deal, with the worst effects mitigated for the 27 by temporary recognition of UK standards to allow, for example, direct flights to continue, would be bearable. The European commission is preparing plans along these lines. There would be emergency support for those, like Ireland, who were worst hit. And, crucially, the crisis would be short. The impact on the UK from customs delays alone would be so disastrous that London would quickly come back to the negotiating table.In this sense it doesn’t matter whether the UK government or parliament is the blocker to a deal. For the EU, no deal is not an end state it is the continuation of negotiation by other means.This is not fully appreciated in the UK, where – because of the internal struggle for Conservative MPs’ votes – both sides deliberately talk about no deal in extreme, quasi-religious terms. The UK will “fall” into a dark pit of rationing and transport chaos if backbenchers defy the prime minister, or (as hard Brexiteers have it) the country will purify itself of self-doubt in a baptism of fire. Either way, no deal is depicted as a long, hard struggle.In reality, as cabinet ministers are realising, no deal would quickly bring the UK to a halt, and destroy the government which presided over it. Blaming EU intransigence would not hold as a line for very long, with motorways gridlocked and essential supplies uncertain. Very senior customs officials compare this scenario privately to a first world war battlefield. “It will be triage,” says one customs officers on the ground making inidual decisions to wave through suffering live animals, or medicines, holding back almost everything else. The National Audit Office shows how far away the UK is from being able to cope with the realities of a third-country relationship with the EU at 11pm on 29 March.The EU will not choose this route just to make a point. It would be painful for many member states, and particular regions – such as Calais and the surrounding Hauts-de-France – would suffer. A prolonged no deal would be disastrous for Ireland, trapped by geography. It could fracture EU unity over Brexit. But the important fact is that key EU leaders think they can take the risk, confident it would only last a matter of days before the UK had to seek a deal.It is a huge risk. The British government would either come to terms or quickly fall. Even if the UK agreed a deal, we would be facing an unprecedented political crisis. The government would still have to get a deal through parliament, with a substantive bill, as we explain in our report “Time is running out to enact a withdrawal agreement bill”.Approving a government motion on the withdrawal agreement is just one of two steps needed for the UK to ratify the deal. The second is the passage of primary legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement, which must receive royal assent before the Brexit deadline of 29 March.That would happen in a mood of shock and, potentially, humiliation. A general election, even a new referendum, are possible. But so is a hung parliament or a popular rejection of the deal. In that scenario, all bets are off.There will be more negotiating posturing before agreement is reached, and quieter fears of no deal happening by accident. The UK’s decision-makers, in government or on the backbenches, would be better placed to avoid that risk if they understood why the EU can – and will – contemplate no deal. And why they are sure that the UK cannot.• Paul McGrade provides senior counsel at Lexington Communications.

I just think that’s unbelievable,” he said.Brodie defended the SLC’s practice under robust questioning from the committee’s chair, the Conservative MP Robert Halfon.“Social media tends to be public. We have a duty to make sure that the taxpayers’ funds are being properly disbursed, and if there are public sources of information the terms and conditions on which people apply allow us to look at public sources of information,” he said.Halfon repeatedly pressed Brodie to say whether he personally approved of the SLC’s use of social media to uncover sensitive information.“Surely that is an abuse. You’re creating a surveillance society. How can it be right to trawl people’s social media accounts?” Halfon said. “I find this really sinister, to be honest, because people don’t always use privacy settings and they might have deeply emotional issues or family trauma, rightly or wrongly.”Despite receiving eight questions in succession from Halfon, the SLC’s non-executive chair kept to his position. “Parliament requires we have a duty to look after public funds,” he said.“It doesn’t say you should trawl through Facebook accounts,” Halfon replied.Earlier in the hearing Paula Sussex, the SLC’s newly appointed chief executive, told the committee that the company’s handling of the issue “could have been a lot better, clearly”.“We’ve taken away several lessons from very many points in the organisation, and it’s now my job to oversee them being delivered,” she said.Asked by Mears if the episode showed that the SLC needed to be humanised in the way it operated, Sussex replied: “It’s very difficult for me to say after five weeks to say if it is human or not. I think listening more carefully, and perhaps having the courage to say, ‘This doesn’t feel quite right’.“But when you’re in a frontline service, and you’ve got rising demand, phones ringing off the hook, queues, et cetera, it’s quite hard to develop that muscle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38166628f8bdb58897b2bd2c7a746c4ba06b1813/0_285_5018_3012/master/5018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d56baffc74aa4310a640ab20a3fb12","title":"humanity wiped out animals since 1970 major report finds","story":"The huge loss is a tragedy in itself but also threatens the survival of civilisation, say the world’s leading scientists The new estimate of the massacre of wildlife is made in a major report produced by WWF and involving 59 scientists from across the globe. It finds that the vast and growing consumption of food and resources by the global population is destroying the web of life, billions of years in the making, upon which human society ultimately depends for clean air, water and everything else.“This is far more than just being about losing the wonders of nature, desperately sad though that is,” he said. “This is actually now jeopardising the future of people. Nature is not a ‘nice to have’ – it is our life-support system.”“We are rapidly running out of time,” said Prof Johan Rockström, a global sustainability expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “Only by addressing both ecosystems and climate do we stand a chance of safeguarding a stable planet for humanity’s future on Earth.”Wildlife and the ecosystems are vital to human life, said Prof Bob Watson, one of the world’s most eminent environmental scientists and currently chair of an intergovernmental panel on bioersity that said in March that the destruction of nature is as dangerous as climate change.“Nature contributes to human wellbeing culturally and spiritually, as well as through the critical production of food, clean water, and energy, and through regulating the Earth’s climate, pollution, pollination and floods,” he said. “The Living Planet report clearly demonstrates that human activities are destroying nature at an unacceptable rate, threatening the wellbeing of current and future generations.”The biggest cause of wildlife losses is the destruction of natural habitats, much of it to create farmland. Three-quarters of all land on Earth is now significantly affected by human activities. Killing for food is the next biggest cause – 300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction – while the oceans are massively overfished, with more than half now being industrially fished.African elephants: With 55 being poached for ivory every day, more are being poached than are being born, meaning populations are plungingOrangutans: More than 100,000 were lost in Borneo alone between 1999 and 2015, largely due to forest destruction for timber and palm oil, leaving the great apes critically endangeredWhale sharks: Numbers of the largest fish have collapsed by two thirds in the last 75 years in the Indian and-Pacific Oceans, due to overfishing and ship collisions.Wandering albatross: Populations are declining rapidly, driven largely by accidental catches in long line fisheries.

Global trade introduces invasive species and disease, with amphibians decimated by a fungal disease thought to be spread by the pet trade.“It is a classic example of where the disappearance is the result of our own consumption, because the deforestation is being driven by ever expanding agriculture producing soy, which is being exported to countries including the UK to feed pigs and chickens,” he said. The UK itself has lost much of its wildlife, ranking 189th for bioersity loss out of 218 nations in 2016.The Living Planet Index has been criticised as being too broad a measure of wildlife losses and smoothing over crucial details. But all indicators, from extinction rates to intactness of ecosystems, show colossal losses. “They all tell you the same story,” said Barrett.But Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, said the fundamental issue was consumption: “We can no longer ignore the impact of current unsustainable production models and wasteful lifestyles.”The world’s nations are working towards a crunch meeting of the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020, when new commitments for the protection of nature will be made. “We need a new global deal for nature and people and we have this narrow window of less than two years to get it,” said Barrett. “This really is the last chance. We have to get it right this time.”Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: “We are the first generation to know we are destroying our planet and the last one that can do anything about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722449c1ed9e5e0c431ebb7cf2ddc5374cfe1b76/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14a0287ed9df2978f0559a8ef41a345a","title":"atmospheric autumnal scenes london in pictures","story":"As the leaves began falling from the trees, photographer David Levene took his son Solly around London to capture autumn in all its glory"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3cbcbeaa5fc81e89042436b2a1655b74a6ecd0/1334_57_2036_1222/master/2036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc7268b94e8c1bf4ccb6600462b55cdb","title":"what is the meaning of theresa may twofer coat","story":"George Osborne’s Caesar haircut showed that budget-day dressing is ripe for analysis. So, what does the prime minister’s Italian double-coat tell us?If it feels unfair to analyse what Theresa May is wearing in the picture above, bear in mind that there are few days when a politician’s clothes matter more than budget day, regardless of their gender. As with a royal at their wedding or pre-season catwalk collections, these optics can prove useful as an indicator of what is to come. And whether or not you like what you see, you can certainly read into it – just remember what fun we had with George Osborne’s Caesar haircut at the 2015 budget.So, where to begin with May’s coat? First, it is one coat, designed to look like two, and known as a twofer. Double-coating is a trick, but it is also rooted in fashion: it has been in vogue since Balmain 2015 and was seen on this year’s autumnwinter catwalks. And May is a woman who asked for a lifetime subscription to Vogue on Desert Island Discs. The fact that she is wearing a coat deliberately designed to look like two suggests prior knowledge.As for the complex layering – it has a funnel neck, cropped sleeves, a quilted lining, a detachable neck and sleeve panels for added layering insulation – it is drowning in symbolism. Yes, we are having a cold snap, but couldn’t that be linked to climate change, which was mentioned nowhere in Hammond’s budget? And is it fair to say the reception on Monday wasn’t much less frosty? In short, is this layering a question of May protecting herself from the cold?Alternatively, did she choose it to make it look as though she was wearing all her clothes simultaneously, you know, like she is thrifty? After all, this coat costs £750, a curious amount of money to spend, even if the end of austerity is supposedly in sight. We all remember trousergate, when May wore a pair of £995 gold leather trousers in a Vogue shoot in 2016 while answering questions about the “just about managing” families look how that played out.The final piece of the puzzle is the brand, Herno, an Italian company that specialises in functionality and outerwear and is based in Lombardy, which is in the EU. I will just leave that there.When Steve Bannon wore two shirts, his spokesperson claimed it was about planning: “He’s always got a contingency plan. If one shirt gets ruined, put the next one on. If one pen dies? Just use another pen.” In the case of May, we live in a world where communication is visual, where clothing is our common language and where buying a £750 coat seems tone deaf when your government is introducing income tax cuts that will benefit only the sort of people who can afford to spend that much on fashion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ffc0261db6220879f2c63c436c860e6964fd72/0_957_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adad06899db00308ad5b1a464e1f775e","title":"nigel slater celery soup with toasted cheese","story":"A deep, satisfying soup bursting with flavourWash and trim 700g of celery.

Cardiff were also involved in conversations with Leicester and the Premier League over the best way to approach Saturday’s game, and the club’s executive director issued a message of support.“Following Saturday evening’s terrible events at the King Power stadium the thoughts and feelings of Leicester City are at the forefront of our minds,” Cardiff’s Ken Choo said. “We will be offering our support to Leicester in any way necessary in respect of this weekend’s fixture.”Leicester’s City Hall and County Hall will light up in blue this week as part of ongoing tributes to Vichai and the four other victims, Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare and pilots Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz.

This is not just bad science – it will cost lives, say expertsButter is back. Saturated fat is good for you. Cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease. Claims along these lines keep finding their way into newspapers and mainstream websites – even though they contradict decades of medical advice. There is a battle going on for our hearts and minds.According to a small group of dissident scientists, whose work usually first appears in minor medical journals, by far the greatest threat to our hearts and vascular systems comes from sugar, while saturated fat has been wrongly demonised. And because cholesterol levels don’t matter, they argue, we don’t need the statins that millions have been prescribed to lower them. A high-fat diet is the secret to a healthy life, they say. Enjoy your butter and other animal fats. Cheese is great. Meat is back on the menu.This is more than bad science, according to leading scientists and medical authorities. It will cost lives. “Encouraging people to eat more saturated fat is dangerous and irresponsible,” is a typical verdict, in this case from Prof Louis Levy, the head of nutrition science at Public Health England (PHE). “There is good evidence that a high intake of saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease. We need to think about where the sources of saturated fat are and how we can reduce them. The largest contributions are dairy products, including butter, and meat and meat products.”The advice from PHE, the World Health Organization, the British Heart Foundation (BHF), Heart UK and other institutions and top academics is consistent. Butter and cheese may be fine in modest amounts in a balanced diet, but the saturated fat that they contain is potentially risky. Too much of it causes the liver to overproduce “bad” LDL cholesterol, which is implicated in heart disease.Mainstream scientists usually keep their disquiet to themselves. But last week, some broke cover over what they see as one medical journal’s support for advocates of a high-fat diet. More than 170 academics signed a letter accusing the British Journal of Sports Medicine of bias, triggered by an opinion piece that it ran in April 2017 calling for changes to the public messaging on saturated fat and heart disease. Saturated fat “does not clog the arteries”, said the piece, which was not prompted by original research. “Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease and it can be reduced effectively by walking 22 minutes a day and eating real food,” wrote the cardiologist Aseem Malhotra and colleagues. The BHF criticised the claims as “misleading and wrong”.David Nunan, from Oxford University’s centre for evidence-based medicine, and three colleagues wrote a rebuttal that the journal at first did not use and then, more than a year later, put behind a paywall, while the original article was free. Last week’s letter of complaint asked Dr Fiona Godlee, the editor-in-chief of the BMJ, which publishes the British Journal of Sports Medicine, to intervene, saying the journal had run 10 pieces advocating low-carb diets and criticising statins in the past three years and that the reluctance to run the rebuttal showed a bias and lack of transparency. She replied defending the journal’s right to challenge “the status quo in some settings”, but allowed free access to the rebuttal.Every time a new review or opinion is published in an obscure or unlikely journal – sports medicine is, after all, primarily about helping the fit get even fitter – it is picked up by newspapers that know statin scares sell. Very often in the UK they quote Malhotra, a charming and telegenic young cardiologist in private practice whose website describes him as “one of the most influential and effective campaigning doctors in the world on issues that affect obesity, heart disease and population health”. He is, it says, “not just a cardiologist. This is a man who wants to change the world one meal at a time by not just rocking the system but by rebuilding it.”Malhotra urges a low-carb, high-fat diet. His book, The Pioppi Diet, has the distinction of being named by the British Dietetic Association as one of the five worst “celeb” diet books in Britain – celebrities who have tried it include MPs Keith Vaz and Andy Burnham. It includes lots of fruit and vegetables, olive oil and fish, but otherwise “hijacks” the Mediterranean diet, says the BDA.“The authors may well be the only people in the history of the planet who have been to Italy and come back with a diet named after an Italian village that excludes pasta, rice and bread – but includes coconuts – perhaps because they have a low-carb agenda,” says the BDA. “The suggestion that this Italian village should be associated with recipes for cauliflower-base pizza and rice substitute made from grated cauliflower or anything made using coconut oil is ridiculous. It also uses potentially dangerous expressions like ‘clean meat’ and encourages people to starve themselves for 24 hours at a time every week.”He was accused by Prof Rory Collins at Oxford University of endangering lives. Collins said scare stories about statins could do as much harm as Andrew Wakefield did when he claimed that vaccines caused autism.When it comes to statins, there is a huge database of research. Since 1994, the Nuffield department of population health at Oxford University, led by two eminent epidemiologists, Collins and Prof Richard Peto, has been amassing and analysing the data in order to figure out how well they work in preventing heart attacks and strokes.They have published many papers. In 2016, in a major review in the Lancet, they concluded that lowering cholesterol over five years with a cheap daily statin would prevent 1,000 heart attacks, strokes and coronary artery bypasses among 10,000 people who had already had one. It would also prevent 500 in people who were at increased risk, for instance because of high blood pressure or diabetes.“Our review shows that the numbers of people who avoid heart attacks and strokes by taking statin therapy are very much larger than the numbers who have side-effects with it,” Collins said at the time. Most side-effects can be reversed by stopping the statin, he pointed out – but heart attacks cause permanent damage. “Consequently,” he said, “there is a serious cost to public health from making misleading claims about high side-effect rates that inappropriately dissuade people from taking statin therapy despite the proven benefits.”But the cholesterol sceptics and statins critics reject the evidence on the basis that the trial data is from big pharma and that the raw data is not in the public domain. Maryanne Demasi, a journalist in Australia whose TV programmes questioning statins were pulled from the ABC network because of concerns over impartiality, wrote in January – again in the British Journal of Sports Medicine – of a “crisis of confidence” in the public because “the raw data on the efficacy and safety of statins are being kept secret and have not been subjected to scrutiny by other scientists … Doctors and patients are being misled.”There were cholesterol sceptics before statins existed, doubting the hypothesis that high cholesterol in the blood, particularly in the form of LDL, furs up the arteries, leading in the worst cases to a blood clot that can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Yet, says Dermot Neely, a consultant in clinical biochemistry and metabolic medicine and a founder trustee of the Heart UK charity: “The cholesterol hypothesis is supported by a vast amount of scientific data.” Recently, an expert paper was published by the European Atherosclerosis Society summarising all the evidence, to try to silence the sceptics.But they won’t be silenced. A website called Thincs – The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics – links to published and unpublished papers as well as the various books its members have written, including a joint one entitled Fat and Cholesterol Don’t Cause Heart Attacks. And Statins Are Not the Solution.”That is flat-earthism, says Collins. “The claims that blood LDL cholesterol levels are not causally related to cardiovascular disease (which is really in the same realm as claiming that smoking does not cause cancer) are factually false,” he maintains. He believes there is an argument for refusing to give cholesterol-deniers a platform, just as some will no longer debate with climate change sceptics.Neely says a lot of people ring the nurses and dieticians staffing the Heart UK helpline after reading such stories or hearing about them from family and friends. “We’re very concerned whenever these messages result in people stopping a statin that they were prescribed after their heart attack. Every time there has been a statin scare story in the papers, there is a wave of people who just stop picking up their prescriptions. And as a result of that, many will probably be readmitted with another heart attack down the line,” he says. Some of those are young people who have high cholesterol from birth because of a mutated gene. One of Neely’s patients is a young man whose grandfather and father died of heart attacks at 50. He is on a statin and will be the first in three generations to escape that fate, says Neely.Asked how he can be sure of his position when the vast majority of top research scientists disagree, Ravnskov says: “Because I am right. The reason why the so-called experts say that I am mistaken is that the vast majority are paid generously by the drug companies.” Asked to elaborate, since statins are out of patent and therefore no longer make money for the companies that originally put them on the market, he expounds on the corruption, illegal practices and wealth of pharmaceutical companies.The Oxford researchers, including Collins, have published their funding. The unit has research funds from pharmaceutical companies, but the iniduals do not take money from them. Ironically, say the researchers, if people refuse statins because of concerns over side-effects, they may be put on expensive newer drugs to lower their cholesterol – and this will make money for big pharma.That means statins are given to healthy people to prevent disease and side-effects have become a major issue. The stories are so widespread that people repeat them as if they are incontrovertible, yet the evidence from trials is that even the much-discussed muscle pain is rare. The sceptics dismiss that evidence. Those trials were funded by big pharma, they say, which had a vested interest in hiding any problems with the drugs.Some side-effects may be caused by interactions with other drugs people are on, such as antibiotics. But there is also evidence that some people get muscle pain because they expect to after everything they have heard. It is called the nocebo effect.The dissidents’ arguments are attractively simple. Eat fat, avoid carbs and don’t take the tablets, says Malhotra – who declined to answer questions for this article. We would probably all agree that we should ditch junk food and eat well instead of taking pills. But, realistically, telling people to “eat good food” isn’t going to cut it. The majority of people in the UK and the US are now overweight or obese, with all the heart and vascular problems that brings, and the trend is ever upwards.One thing is for sure – the dissidents are not going to shut up shop. “My belief about the cholesterol sceptics is that they are a bit like religious fundamentalists,” said Neely. “They are not open to argument. Whatever argument you present, they will find another argument because this basically defines who they are.” He cites a cardiologist in the 1980s, Prof Michael Oliver, who was a sceptic of the cholesterol hypothesis that more LDL increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Oliver did a U-turn as more evidence accumulated, saying: “When the facts change, I change my mind.” But, says Neely, “unfortunately the cholesterol sceptics we know currently don’t do that”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a36b379614e6e5dca65419696f54aadf5f56473/0_170_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f969dbfba85d9bccb3c82265a3f407c","title":"wexford opera festival 2018 leoni giordano mercadante bolcom","story":"The Irish festival specialises in reviving neglected rarities – and proves that the road less travelled is well worth takingAlways do something different. Richard Wagner’s famous advice to his admirers should be the motto of Wexford Festival Opera. Different is what Wexford does, year after year – sometimes in the face of daunting financial, artistic and political challenges. It has made the festival what it is: an improbable but unique place of annual autumnal pilgrimage in the opera world as well as one of the prime cultural achievements of modern Ireland.This year’s festival, which ends on 4 November, has been hewn from the same operatic motherlode as its 66 predecessors. Wexford’s speciality is the unknown and neglected operatic repertoire. Its calling cards are the works – sometimes written by household names – that have fallen into neglect. This year’s edition offers new productions of Franco Leoni’s L’Oracolo, Umberto Giordano’s Mala Vita, and Saverio Mercadante’s Il Bravo, along with the European premiere of William Bolcom’s Dinner at Eight, all served up at the excellent National Opera House in which the festival has been based for the past decade.Four new productions is a huge undertaking. In an era when opera companies and audiences in, for instance London, seem determined to play it safe with repeats and revivals, there is something heroic about Wexford’s determination to live more dangerously. Happily, fortune favours the brave. The festival’s audiences roughly comprise one third international visitors (mostly from the UK), one third from the Dublin area, and one third local people. Given that there is much less opera of any kind in Ireland – certainly in comparison with London – it is a striking thought that Wexford’s Irish audiences acquire a much wider education in the art form than most British operagoers. Its variety is surely one reason why they keep coming back for more.It is a smart idea to make a double bill out of Leoni’s L’Oracolo and Giordano’s La Mala Vita. Other than being by Italians of the verismo era and having the tragic endings that this tends to entail, the two works have little in common. The Leoni is set in San Francisco, the Giordano in Naples. Musically, Leoni’s is mostly feeble, while Giordano’s is often the real deal, especially when the Spanish tenor Sergio Escobar lets rip. But the energy level rarely falters in either.Partly that’s because Francesco Cilluffo, who conducted Mascagni’s equally rare Isabeau for Opera Holland Park this summer, grips these scores with such commitment. But Cordelia Chisholm’s revolving tenament set is the real star. Its doorways, windows and shop fronts double as Chinatown and the Neapolitan slums, and – as in Hitchcock’s Rear Window – there is always plenty going on behind the curtains. Street scenes, private passions, dark crimes and stock operatic cliches come at the audience from all sides.Production values at Wexford are always high, and this pays terrific idends in Bolcom’s stylish comedy Dinner at Eight, set in Depression-era New York and based on a George S Kaufman and Edna Ferber Broadway play of 1932. Here too, sets and costumes are full of style and conviction. And operas about dinner parties – Bolcom is following Hindemith and Lennox Berkeley along this seam – have the built-in advantage that they invariably involve a rich mix of contrasted characters, domestic dramas, farcical possibilities and ensemble opportunities.It helps greatly that in the pit is David Agler, Wexford’s artistic director since 2005 (and whose last season will be in 2019), who also conducted the world premiere of Bolcom’s new work for Minnesota Opera last year. It helps too that the wealthy hostess Millicent Jordan is played by the creator of the role, soprano Mary Dunleavy, who brings her to life with vocal and stage daring. Bolcom’s music, efficient and light in touch, is matched by a high-quality libretto by Mark Campbell in which every word is clear.Clarity is not a word that comes to mind when confronted with Mercadante’s Il Bravo. This is the sixth of the prolific Mercadante’s works to be staged at Wexford. The Italian composer’s 1839 setting of what was originally a novel by James Fenimore Cooper has a plot about Venetian treachery and assassination that is hard to follow and harder still to believe. There is fine music, especially in ensembles, in which Rubens Pelizzari in the title role excels, and Mercadante was not alone in writing operas on such daft themes. But it is his fate to have written the kind of operas that Verdi, 18 years his junior, wrote far better, far more incisively, and took in wholly new directions. Il Bravo’s case wasn’t helped by a staging by Renaud Doucet and André Barbe that weighed it down with too many visual pretensions.In the end, however, Wexford audiences don’t seem to mind too much. And there is logic in that approach. Operas that have languished in obscurity for decades, even centuries, have invariably done so for a reason. Very few are likely to come up from out of the vaults of dusty neglect to be revealed as brilliant and gleaming masterpieces. But almost without exception, these works are worth hearing, worth seeing, worth making an effort for and worth thinking about. Sometimes they are revelations. And that is what makes the Wexford festival not just consistently different – but consistently fascinating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c3a840d0d8d878054499602fcbe4703e712a496/781_135_1340_804/master/1340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785d1091eefa2989f187dc0d75a5520a","title":"employers required brexit check eu nationals right to work uk","story":"Caroline Nokes tells MPs firms will have to check eligibility after a no-deal Brexit – but does not know howEmployers will be expected to check whether EU nationals have the right to work in the UK if there is a no-deal Brexit, even though it will be almost impossible to assess this, and the nature of the checks remain unknown, Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, has told MPs.Her disclosure caused dismay among employers’ groups, which have said they have “serious concerns” that the Home Office may give them an impossible task with just five months left until Britain leaves the EU.In a fractious appearance before the home affairs select committee, Nokes said it would be up to companies offering jobs to EU nationals after Brexit to determine whether those applicants were eligible to work in the UK.“If somebody hasn’t been here prior to the end of March next year, employers will have to make sure they go through adequately rigorous checks to evidence somebody’s right to work,” Nokes said, in an apparent new policy disclosure.This appears to contradict a press briefing this summer in which the Home Office indicated it would not require employers to make immigration checks on staff who are EU citizens.When questioned by MPs, Nokes conceded that it would be difficult for employers to make such checks, given that longstanding residents from EU member states had a guaranteed two-year period to go through the “settled status” programme, proving their right to remain and to work.When asked how employers could be expected to make the checks, Nokes said she did not know, and would have to write to the committee later.EU citizens are required to apply for “settled status” to stay in the UK after Brexit, but the registration process is still being tested in a live trial and MPs heard that so far only 650 of the estimated 3.5m who will need to apply have gone through the process.They were also told that the digital system allowing people to apply for the scheme only worked with Android devices, as it had not been possible to come to an agreement for it to work on Apple’s systems.While confirming that a promised immigration bill would “turn off free movement” once Brexit happened – removing the automatic right of EU nationals to live and work in the UK – Nokes said that determining people’s status would be tricky during the planned two-year transition period, whether or not there a deal was agreed. Even if there was no deal, EU nationals would still have until March 2021 to apply for settled status.“In the intervening period of any transition period, it will be incredibly difficult to differentiate between an EU citizen coming here for the first time, for example, and somebody who has been here for a significant period of time and hasn’t yet applied for their settled status but would be perfectly entitled to it if they were to,” Nokes said.Asked by Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, whether companies would be expected to distinguish between the groups, Nokes confirmed that they would: “As part of the right-to-work check, we expect employers to make sure that they are not employing people who do not have the right to work here.”.Repeatedly questioned on the practicalities of any checks, Nokes struggled to respond, at first saying she hoped that “a pragmatic approach” would prevail. Cooper said she was “really baffled”, adding: “Either you’re going to have a system that in practice is unworkable because employers can’t implement it, or you’re going to have to accept that people who are arriving after March 2019 will just be covered by exactly the same rules as people who are already here.”Questioned by Kate Green, the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, Nokes conceded that she did not know what checks might be required. Green replied: “I think it would be very important to employers to know very soon what it is you’re expecting them to check.”After Cooper allowed more questions from MPs, Nokes protested that the session had gone 45 minutes over schedule and she was being kept away from important Brexit planning.Cooper said with only five months to go to a potential no-deal Brexit, the committee had “a whole series of questions that parliament hasn’t had answers to”. Kristiina Cooper of BBC Radio 4’s Today in Parliament shared a video of the tense exchange on Twitter:Nokes said that in talks with business groups, no employer had raised that issue with her. This was disputed, with some saying they had repeatedly raised the issue of what they would be required to do in the event of no deal and had not been given any guidance.“We’ve raised this as a source of serious concern for business communities given the shortening timeframe,” said Mike Spicer, director of economics and research at the British Chambers of Commerce. “Businesses can’t plan on the basis of warm words they need to see written in black and white directions from the government about how exactly this scheme will operate if no deal is reached.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3695cccd44cb35c9218fb789e0c4b06f2123557/0_409_4880_2927/master/4880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10139f6e119fe4e435c700afd212774b","title":"khashoggi case could impact uk support for saudi involvement in yemen","story":"Middle East minister rejects calls by aid agencies for UK to demand unilateral ceasefireThe outcome of the investigation into the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi could potentially impact on British support for Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the war in Yemen, the UK’s Middle East minister has said.Speaking on Tuesday, Alistair Burt told the House of Commons it was “not an illegitimate question” to ask whether the inquiry would reveal something of the character of the regime in Riyadh and that this would have a bearing on the war in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia entered in 2015.In an often stormy session of the international development select committee, Burt stood his ground despite warnings from aid agencies that Yemen was heading towards one of the worst famines in history and claims he was not using British diplomatic influence at the UN to end the civil war between the Saudi-backed government and Houthi rebels.He rejected impassioned calls by aid agencies and former senior diplomats for the UK to use its influence to demand a unilateral ceasefire and the full deployment of humanitarian aid.A London meeting of the Elders, the most senior group of former UN diplomats, called for the UK to encourage the UN to take urgent, credible action to lift the humanitarian blockade. The group, chaired by the former UN climate change special envoy Gro Harlem Brundtland, also demanded an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia.Burt was speaking as the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, held unscheduled talks in London with Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen. Conservative backing for the war in Yemen has been badly damaged by the Khashoggi murder, even if there is little support for the Iranian-backed Houthis.Burt repeatedly insisted the UK was not a party to the conflict and blamed the Houthis for the failure of talks organised by the UN envoy in Geneva.His claim drew a furious response from the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who told Burt: “We arm the Saudis. We maintain the air force. We have British soldiers embedded in the control centres. We command the war flight paths. We train Saudi pilots in Wales – the only thing we don’t do is press the button to drop the bomb.“Can we just not be honest? We are party to this war. We have decided to cosy up to a regime that dismembers its own civilians in consulates of Nato allies.”Burt responded, saying: “We are not party to the conflict, we do not control any flight paths, the coalition is acting in defence of a legitimate government.”Ending UK support for Saudi Arabia would not bring an end to the conflict, he added, while rejecting efforts to push for a new ceasefire resolution at the UN, saying Griffiths did not support such a move since it was unlikely to be accepted on the ground.Earlier, Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the UK was one of a small group of countries that could stop Yemen’s relentless deterioration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bef485bc387a89a1eba43316d553daf97589138d/51_0_1675_1005/master/1675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=759ba275fb3962f82299f4c790c30588","title":"philip hammond defends budget in morning interviews politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Philip Hammond’s morning interviews about his budgetMedia reports have surfaced this weekend suggesting UK intelligence services were aware of the Saudi plan to abduct the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and take him back to Riyadh, and of the deployment of the hit squad to Istanbul for that purpose. Can I give the foreign secretary the opportunity to tell the House today that those reports are categorically untrue?I hope she will understand that I don’t comment on intelligence matters, but if it reassures her I had absolutely no prior knowledge myself of the terrible Khashoggi murder and was as shocked as I think everyone else.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, then asked Hunt again if the intelligence services knew in advance about the plot, or whether he had asked them this.

Thanks for your contributions.This morning Philip Hammond, the chancellor, claimed that overall the poorest gained most from the budget. (See 8.22am.) As evidence for this, he cited the Treasury’s distributional analysis. But this focuses on the impact of all changes since autumn 2016, and this timescale means that the impact of the massive welfare cuts announced in the George Osborne summer budget of 2015 are not included. In its own briefing on the distributional impact of the budget the Institute for Fiscal Studies looks at the impact of all changes since the 2015 general election and, over this timescale, it is clear that the poor have lost the most policy has been regressive.Here is the key chart. It shows that what was announced yesterday made almost no difference to the overall pattern since 2015 (see the difference between the black and orange lines).This is from the Joint Council from the Welfare of Immigrants on Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, saying employers would have to check the status of EU nationals from April next year if there is a no deal Brexit. (See 3.31pm.)The Commons home affairs committee is just winding up a hearing about immigration after Brexit. According to colleagues who were following the proceedings, it was a bit of a car crash, with Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, making a particularly poor impression.Here are some Twitter highlights.From my colleague Peter WalkerFrom my colleague Lisa O’CarrollFrom the BBC’s Dominic CascianiFrom the BBC’s Laura KuenssbergThis is from Ayesha Hazarika, who worked as a Labour adviser to Harriet Harman and Ed Miliband in a previous era.McDonnell seems to have answered her question. (See 2.39pm.) The latter, it seems ...John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been speaking to journalists and defending his decision to accept the income tax cuts in the budget (see 10.13am), my colleague Heather Stewart reports.As the  reports, Hammond is being criticised by some of his own colleagues for this decision.Turning back to the IFS briefing, here are the main points from the briefing (pdf) from Paul Johnson, the IFS director. All that said, this is no bonanza. Many public services are going to feel squeezed for some time to come. Cuts are not about to be reversed. If I were a prison governor, a local authority chief executive or a headteacher I would struggle to find much to celebrate. I would be preparing for more difficult years ahead.With some other changes designed to smooth its roll out, this will increase planned spending on universal credit by around £2bn a year. For many people this increase in work allowances will essentially undo the cuts announced by George Osborne in 2015 – though not for the childless non-disabled. Their work allowances were cut to zero in 2015 and there they remain. These changes, on top of the cut in the taper rate announced last year, will help “make work pay” for many recipients. They are just about enough to push the expected cost (and hence generosity) of universal credit higher than the system it replaces. This is a small increase in generosity compared to the cuts to working age benefits introduced since 2015 and it is small relative to cuts still to come in. Four years of benefit freezes, and the ending of family premiums and of payments in respect of third and subsequent children are a much bigger deal than this increase in work allowances.Of course these changes benefit the better off – though you only need £12,500 in income to benefit from the personal allowance increase. On average they will benefit over 30m people by an average of around £44 a year, with the typical higher rate taxpayer gaining £176 and the typical basic rate taxpayer gaining £24. Contrast that with the changes to universal credit. They help far fewer people – about 2.4m families – but help them a lot more, by over £600 a year.Whilst capital spending is still set to rise and to reach a high level by historic standards, Mr Hammond actually raided some of the increases he announced a couple of years ago to pay for more day-to-day spending. Capital limits were cut by a pretty chunky £7bn for 2020-21. Mind you the OBR had assumed that most of this would not have been spent in any case. To announce big increases in capital spending, fail to persuade the independent fiscal watchdog that you are capable of actually spending it, and then raid it a couple of years later, does not speak to the highest quality of spending control and planning.It’s important to put improvements in the forecasts in context. Yes they got better. Borrowing this year is set to be £12bn less than forecast in March. But that is still nearly £30bn more than was forecast in March 2015. Borrowing next year, after the measures announced yesterday, is forecast to be £2bn less than expected in March this year, but £40bn more than forecast in March 2016. Q: When you leave the EU, will you follow Nordic environmental and climate change politcies? Or will you make your own?May says the UK wants to see the EU continuing to be a strong entity.She also says the UK is serious about tackling climate change. The Chequers plan would involve the UK maintaining high standards in this area, she says.May finished her speech without saying anything newsworthy (even by the standards of a live blog.) But she is now taking questions.Q: Can you assure us the Nordic people will still be able to enjoy the access to the UK they have now? And will you offer people a referendum?May says when people voted in the referendum they wanted an end to free movement. Free movement will come to an end. Instead the UK will develop immigration rules affecting people coming to the UK from around the whole world. The new system will focus on skills.But, as the UK negotiates with the EU, there will be a mobility heading, looking at things like short-term business visitors. And she says the government wants seamless movement for visitors.On the referendum, she says it may come as a disappointment to the Nordic Council, but the UK parliament decided to give the decision to the people. And they voted to leave the EU.Theresa May is giving a speech in Oslo to the Nordic Council now. There is a live feed here.So far she has just been making general remarks about links between the UK and Nordic countries, including the observation: “Some of us occasionally dance to Abba.”This is what Paul Johnson, the IFS director, says in his statement at the briefing on whether the budget means that austerity is over.So to the inevitable question, “is austerity over?”. Well we will only really know when we have some firmer plans, but from the numbers we have I think we can say the following: There was a big upward revision to overall spending plans Spending on the NHS will rise substantially – though less quickly than spending has risen on average over its 70 year history Despite more money for universal credit there are still £4bn or so of net welfare cuts working their way through the system, most obviously with the freeze to the rates of most working age benefits next April Total spending is set to rise in real terms but to fall very slightly as a fraction of national income. Does that add up to the end of austerity? On a narrow definition perhaps it does, on wider definitions it doesn’t, at least not yet. But whatever the precise definitions this is certainly a considerable easing in spending control and a change of fiscal direction. Any idea that there is a serious desire to eliminate the deficit by the mid 2020s is surely for the birds. Here is the quote from the IFS’s director, Paul Johnson, explaining why he thinks the budget was a gamble.So now we know. When push comes to shove it’s not tax rises and it’s not the NHS that Mr Hammond is willing to gamble on, it’s the public finances. Because yesterday’s budget was a bit of a gamble. Yes the OBR reduced borrowing forecasts so he was able to find more money without committing to more borrowing. But what the OBR gives the OBR can take away. Suppose the public finance forecasts deteriorate significantly next year. They might. There’s perhaps a one in three chance of that. What will he do then? It’s hard to see austerity starting up again with promised spending increases not materialising. The chances of getting sizeable tax rises though parliament are next to nil. It’s surely borrowing that would take the strain. Fair enough. That’s a judgment. But it’s a judgment that could see debt ratchet upwards.Here is the text (pdf) of the opening remarks from Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, at its briefing about the budget which is taking place now.I will post a summary shortly.Philip Hammond has taken a “gamble” on the future health of the public finances by using better short-term borrowing figures to raise spending on the NHS, according to Britain’s leading tax and spending thintank.The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that the public finances could deteriorate next year, at a time when Britain leaves the EU, which could pose difficult questions for the government after the chancellor increased spending on the health service.It said there was perhaps a one in three chance that the public finances would deteriorate significantly next year.Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said: When push comes to shove it’s not tax rises and it’s not the NHS that Mr Hammond is willing to gamble on, it’s the public finances.James Rothwell, the ’s Brexit correspondent, has more on what Oslo thinks about the UK staying in the EEA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f81c1d55254ab87ba8adf9e746224b463bc61068/47_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a40f0dd89c8f9f2815d9507b76eb98f","title":"the lazy zombies guide to youth a radio course with the power to change lives","story":"A new course from ŠKODA is giving young adults a chance to explore their creativity, voice their feelings and expand their skillsOnce home to countless giants of broadcasting, Manchester’s Granada Studios is now a training ground for a new generation. Though the telly sets are long gone, it remains the home of Reform Radio, an online station that also acts as an incubator for young people interested in a career on the airwaves.And if getting ahead in creative industries means subverting expectations, it’s clear the latest batch of students are off to a good start. Huddled around mixing desks and microphones, the show they’re workshopping is called The Lazy Zombies’ Guide to Youth – a sardonic riff on the perceived lack of motivation and creative energy often attributed to the digital generation.They arrived on Monday with little to no relevant experience by the end of the week they’ll produce and present the show to a gathered audience of friends and family. A project from ŠKODA in partnership with The Prince’s Trust as part of the former’s Driver’s Seat Initiative – which aims to celebrate independently minded people who want to make a positive difference to the world – it’s open to 16-25-year-olds who are not in education or employment. That’s a fairly broad window of eligibility, so what drives participants to get involved?For Rhys Forteau, 19, it’s about generating a creative spark. “I think that doing something creative helps you understand yourself a bit better – you find new sides to yourself, and that gives you more motivation,” he says. “My mum wanted me to be a care assistant. I did a bit of training and I enjoyed it at first, but it’s not something I could see myself doing in five years’ time. This course has shown me I can make my own opportunities, not just follow in others’ footsteps.”Along with independent thought, another trait in no short supply among the group is tenacity. Jacob Bowen and Sophie Heng-Travis, both 24, have worked in a number of jobs since graduating with qualifications in creative fields, though both feel they have yet to realise their full potential. For them, the course is an opportunity to widen their skillsets and meet similarly ambitious people.“For me it’s about building my toolkit,” says theatre graduate Bowen. “It’s alright doing filler jobs for a while, but I graduated three years ago. It gets a bit tedious.”Writer and poet Heng-Travis agrees, and suggests it’s a lack of persistence that leads to a lot of young people falling short of achieving their dreams. “I think for some people our age, it’s sad that you have to settle and just do something that’s not what you want to do. But you have to make money and be part of the system, which can mean doing something that’s mediocre. That’s what I find frustrating. But you’ve got to be persistent, you’ve got to keep going.”Course tutor Adam Seymour has not only seen the effect the course has had on countless young people – he’s also a living, breathing testament to the power of training to change lives. He took a similar course himself as a student two years ago, at a time when mental health issues had been holding him back. “I didn’t have a lot of confidence in my own abilities,” says Seymour. “I needed a bit of a boost, a safe space, I needed people around me who were in the same boat, because sometimes when you’re suffering with anxiety and depression and other wellbeing issues, it’s hard to reach out to people.”Seymour’s experience suggests it’s not simply inidual qualities, but rather a joint mentality of determination, and a willingness to collaborate, that’s the key to making the most of a course like this. Bowen agrees: “Having a platform where we can use that fire in our belly, from all the things that are going on with today’s youth, is massively, massively important. It’s about getting together with a few different people from different backgrounds, being on a level playing field and having something to say.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe65b87703bc20d82471bd0973fbb747ddce33b/424_137_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a5d6d90abb53b06b0c38d325c1d324","title":"why young creatives are choosing theatre over digital mediums","story":"Theatre may not seem like the natural medium of young people, but a creative course from ŠKODA is finding that plenty of aspiring young people are keen to get a start in the craftGathered in a studio space within Birmingham Repertory Theatre are a group of people who have either discovered an incredible anti-ageing product, or are bucking a serious trend. According to audience-monitoring charity Audience Agency, younger people are in such short supply at the theatre that the typical crowd’s average age is 52 years old. This lot, it seems, are the exceptions.The group are taking a week-long theatre course that’s part of ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative, which works in partnership with the Prince’s Trust, to give people aged 16–25 not in education or employment a leg-up. The initiative includes starter courses in all sorts of digitally-focused creative industries that you might expect the younger generation to opt for instead of fusty old theatre, so what’s the allure of this most analogue of mediums?“It’s an evolving art form, which fascinates me,” says 21-year-old Freddie Apperly. “What’s considered the norm of theatrical practices today, could be old school and prehistoric in 20 years’ time.” Considering the proliferation of immersive theatre, and the cross-pollination of mediums evident in entertainment such as Secret Cinema and escape rooms, it’s hard to disagree with him.For Laurie Weston, 22, a grounding in theatre is the ideal way to pick up transferable skills. “It’s a great way to learn collaboration and teamwork,” he says. “You’ve got actors who bounce off each other, then you’ve also got people who design the set, sound and lighting who all have to work closely together to get the cues right.”To other young people, the very fact that theatre isn’t a primarily digital medium is all part of the appeal. “Curiosity drove me because I just wanted to know how it works,” says 18-year-old Harry Bell, who’s keen to get backstage to find out more about sound and lighting. “I went to see Chicago with school – now, I can’t remember a thing about Chicago, but I just remember thinking: ‘How are they getting those actors’ voices from there to my ears?’ I wanted to know how it worked, the acoustics of the theatre, I wanted to understand that.”As well as a reputation for appealing to older generations, theatre also carries an image of inaccessibility and elitism at a grassroots level. And while today’s would-be thesps are well aware of the barriers to entry, it seems these are not enough to put them off. For 20-year-old Danni Manley, it just means being more selective about the doors you try to shove your foot in. “I went to apply for drama schools, but you have to pay to audition and I couldn’t afford them all, so I only did two out of three,” she says. “It’s quite annoying. It doesn’t put me off, it just makes it harder.”Bell, for one, is taken by a medium that offers an alternative to the polished, nipped and tucked output of most digital media consumed through a screen. “With theatre, you can’t really fix anything in post,” he says. “You have to get it right, there and then. That’s definitely something I want to do, without a doubt in my mind.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4639aab0971f623fdd4ba037df8d1bedc983a0fe/0_5_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8ee27267df074d186be10abd49c59df","title":"salford mayor","story":"Salford’s mayor on the fight for truly affordable, quality housing – and an end to outsourcingIn the run-up to this week’s budget, the chancellor’s phone will have been ringing off the hook, with cabinet ministers lobbying for more funding for their briefs. Theresa May claimed in her party conference speech that “austerity is over”, but for most local authorities that simply isn’t the case, and without a billion-pound cash injection, councils already cut to the bone face making yet more cuts.The elected mayor of Salford, Labour’s Paul Dennett, feels this acutely: “Since 2010, we’ve lost a significant amount of money: £198m in direct reductions to our grant, and also increased budget pressures and devolved responsibilities which are often unfunded by the government. A good example of that is the pay deals and awards for staff, which are nationally negotiated, but we get no money from government whatsoever to finance that.”Dennett says “an awful lot” has been lost already. Intermediate care packages have been “decimated”, alongside cuts to welfare rights, debt advice, homelessness and health improvement services, and a reduction in numbers of iniduals eligible for personal care support.With such fiscal brutality landed on local authorities, the temptation to outsource services to cut costs is high, but Dennett says Salford has fought it. “In Salford we’ve tried our hardest to hold on to public sector workers and public sector jobs. We have already taken the decision to bring highways, building control and utilities back in house. In addition, we would ideally like to be taking our care workers back in house, and council-house stock, too.”How difficult is it to bring outsourced services back in house? “We genuinely believe in direct employment of public sector workers: we think they are best placed to deliver services within our local communities. So we’ll do as much of that as we possibly can. However, it doesn’t get any easier when we’ve got another £16m to take out of the budget over the next financial year,” he explains. “Obviously what that does is drive an agenda of outsourcing and commissioning of services and a race to the bottom in terms of employment. And we’ve seen that especially with domiciliary care workers and some of our care homes, whom we commission but don’t directly employ. These people aren’t paid for travel time, they’re paid what the government classes as a living wage, which isn’t a living wage.”Growing up in Warrington, Dennett experienced poverty and deprivation first-hand when his father lost his job, and is passionate about the importance of frontline public services as a result of the experiences of his family, housing in particular. Using funds from a developer, Salford is building socially rented, council-owned properties through its company Dérive, named after a revolutionary theory by French Marxist philosopher Guy Debord. “When Andy Burnham came to power he asked me to join his cabinet, so I lead on planning, infrastructure and housing, homelessness and rough sleeping. Three of those areas are significant priority areas for Andy. I’m leading on the Greater Manchester housing strategy, and negotiating with, or trying to negotiate with, the government on the housing deal at the moment,” he says. “Which is easier said than done: the government is fixated on housing as a number, it’s not necessarily interested in what we’re interested in: truly affordable, good-quality housing.So could Salford go bust like Northamptonshire county council effectively did earlier this year? “We are lucky in many respects, and have had good fiscal leadership for a long time,” he says. “Salford has an extensive capital programme, and capital investments, which have sparked growth at MediaCityUK and the Quays, bring in commercial revenue, and regenerate areas, resulting in much needed business rates. We also have significant population growth, contributing to a growing tax base.Northamptonshire is in the predicament it currently is partly due to cuts, but also because of a culture of outsourcing which fragments the delivery of services and increases costs and exposure in the long term.”Dennett is one of the few senior local authority figures who is a member of the Labour campaigning group Momentum: “I’m a member of Momentum, I’m a supporter, I think they’re doing a fantastic job at keeping our party where they should be and that’s on the left of the political spectrum, driven by proper values and beliefs and an understanding of what solidarity really means,” he says. “We talk about ‘For the many, not the few’, and actually we need to practise that as a party.” At the Labour party conference, Dennett and several other local politicians launched their Councils Against Austerity campaign, which seeks to lobby more effectively against cuts and collect and commission qualitative and quantitative academic research into the impact of austerity measures on services delivered by local authorities, and on people’s lives and communities.“We’ve done a lot of work recently on the lived experience of people in the private rented sector – they have no choice because of the lack of supply of council housing, but actually getting that data out there and getting academic institutions to give you a methodology is really useful because then you have something you can actually lobby the government with,” he explains. “But we want to do the same with austerity and cuts and how that’s played out since 2010. So where have the government cut resources? Where have they removed ringfences? Where have they devolved responsibilities to local authorities and not funded them? It’s about drawing attention to that and telling the story since 2010, because I don’t think that’s been done effectively, if I’m honest with you.”Education: Great Sankey high school, Warrington University of Ulster (BA international business, MSc human resource management \u0026amp industrial relations, MRES research in social sciences) Manchester politan University (PhD new public management).Career: 2017-present: cabinet member for housing, Greater Manchester combined authority 2016-present: Salford city mayor 2012-2016: councillor and lead member for workforce, industrial relations and equalities, Salford city."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c926293d5473a42cacf821fdbeadc499bfcb5f77/0_199_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66ceb4fcf41e515425f3a898d73c07c8","title":"she is looking for memories love after dementia photo essay","story":"Gladys Saroli’s frontotemporal dementia is a cruel disease but her husband, Jose, spends every day by her sideGladys Saroli’s hand is warm and soft to the touch. She gives mine a gentle squeeze.“Hola,” she greets me softly, but soon turns back to the daytime television that fills the common room. Her husband, Jose, is all smiles and handshakes beneath his black cap advertising Peru, the country of their birth, and observes: “Gladys, she look good and well.”Six months ago, when I first met Gladys and Jose, this was not the case. Gladys has frontotemporal dementia. It is a cruel disease that affects the right and left lobes at the front of the brain. Her mobility is limited and speech is almost non-existent. Unlike Alzheimer’s disease, it affects younger people and, rather than targeting memory loss, it begins with a deterioration of speech and abnormal personality changes. The frontal lobes are where we process what we see and hear, meaning the breakdown of these areas results in changes in mood and behaviour and a progressive deterioration of motor function and cognition. “It is a disease which presents with early behavioural or language changes, as well as other cognitive changes including some memory loss,” says Associate Professor Michael Woodward, an expert in the field.When Jose raised the topic with Gladys he was met with confrontational and aggressive moods, which was out of character. Gladys was a strong, intelligent, open-minded woman whose devotion to her husband and family never wavered. Jose and Gladys had been inseparable since resettling in Australia amid political instability in Peru. Belief in each other is the cornerstone upon which their relationship is founded, and to see that belief erode from Gladys pained Jose. “She accuse me of having the hungry eyes. She say: ‘I see you have the eyes for a woman.’ This make me feel no good, because she not believe in me.”After testing and diagnosis, Gladys’s health deteriorated and the family decided to move her to an aged care facility where she would have immediate access to physical and mental healthcare. Jose would remain her primary carer. Since diagnosis, he has spent every day by her side and only when she drifts off to sleep does he return to the family home. “We do have a number of spouses and relatives who visit daily and support their loved ones but this is quite exceptional. It is the commitment Jose and indeed their children have also shown to supporting Gladys which is a standout for me,” says Darinka Rozanic, the manager at Moran Aged Care, where Gladys lives. “The labelling of photos to help support memories, the enthusiasm displayed for participating in activities and events and in general speaking with Gladys even when she could not. They all see the person, not the disease.”The daily care has meant the family, particularly Jose, sees any change in behaviour or health and can act immediately. In April, Gladys’s shoulders were hunched, her eyes vacant and she slept for much of the day. Six months later, she is upright and living permanently outside the specialised dementia unit. That improvement is a testament to Jose’s dedication to Gladys’s wellbeing.“If she is showing a certain type of behaviour, it’s about having the patience to go through, try this, try that, to find a cause then eliminate that for her,” says Roxana, Jose and Gladys’s daughter. “Six, seven months ago her general wellbeing was very bad. No walking, no movement, no facial expression. Dad noticed that and said: ‘No way. This is not what’s meant to be.’” Jose asked to see a specialist and it was decided to slowly reduce Gladys’s medication. He kept a diary to monitor her progress. Roxana adds: “She is more settled, happier. As long as she is good, we are good. She has taught us so much through this.”Jose says: “My favourite moments now are birthdays. Family birthdays she come back to our house in Epping. She is looking, looking. She is happy. She try to remember. To me, she is looking for memories.” Dementia is a formidable foe for the 436,366 Australians living with the disease. Research has yet to find a cure and positive prognoses are scattered.“There are so many factors in ensuring a person with dementia has good quality of life,” says Belinda Nixon, services operations manager at Dementia Australia. “If you are engaged, if you’ve got support, if you are having your needs met, you are going to be better off. No doubt about it.” Jose is in a fortunate position – he has a supportive family, a facility working with him and access to support networks. Sitting in Gladys’s room, surrounded by images of a life lived before dementia dug in its claws – a family portrait at the beach, birthday candles blown out, smiling grandchildren – I ask why he does all that he does for Gladys. Jose touches his heart and says: “Because she is in here, always. She is in here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7640de8a5c7142729203b0fe1372f3986f7202f0/0_237_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86e0c3a175e38796b9ed0bbee11ec79d","title":"simone biles world gymnastics championship team gold usa kidney stone","story":"Simone Biles is now an 11-time world champion after leading the USA women to team gold at the World Gymnastics Championships in Doha on Tuesday.Biles had the highest inidual score in the entire competition on the floor, uneven bars and vault as the US recorded a total of 171.269, with Russia second on 162.863 and China winning bronze with 162.396.

Arthur Flitwick (Steve Pemberton) is back from the shops. He puts a mobile phone on the kitchen table, sticks Symphonic FM on and sets about coddling an egg. The phone rings, there is some sinister but indistinct white noise, the egg explodes in the microwave and the caller rings off. Flitwick redials the last number and what appears to be some vaguely underwhelming domestic farce involving a lost phone and a confused old lady begins to ensue.It is often said that in the age of Twitter and on-demand streaming, secrets are impossible to keep shocks are diffuse and signposted TV is no longer a communal experience. This autumn has presented two strong rebuttals to that idea. First, there was Jed Mercurio’s frantic drama Bodyguard. But on Sunday, the truly audacious live special of Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith’s dark anthology comedy Inside No 9 went further still. You really did have to be there.From Flitwick’s phone call onwards, all bets were off. The arrival of Shearsmith’s vicar Reverend Neale saw the manifestation of the first gremlins: the sound disappeared and BBC Two’s continuity announcer intervened. Twitter collectively speculated about P45s on the way to the production crew and the show lost a fifth of its viewers as the less patient gave up the ghost. But the ghost was just getting started. A repeated (largely silent) episode of Inside No 9 began, but soon we were back in real time, in Pemberton and Shearsmith’s dressing room. Shearsmith flicked on the News at 10 where the green and gold flags of Jair Bolsonaro’s celebrating supporters could be glimpsed. Yes, this was actually happening, right now.This perfectly perplexing half hour of television has been in preparation for a while. The production team have been carefully seeding the show’s central conceit: the haunting of Granada studios. An article appeared in the Sun last week claiming that interventions from deceased Coronation Street stars had been making rehearsals impossible. But even so, what began to unfold was remarkable and unsettling. BBC Two itself appeared to be possessed, stricken by visitations from the studio’s illustrious and traumatic past. From Bobby Davro’s notorious faceplant during the filming of shiny-floor folly Public Enemy Number One to a serious fire during which costumes for The Jewel in The Crown were destroyed, we were suddenly scrolling through an index of Granada-based mishaps. Who knew where it would stop?Were people fooled? However much they might deny it now, yes they were. And actually, what fun to be so playfully toyed with by television to gaze at your screen and feel genuinely bewildered. But better yet, Shearsmith and Pemberton included us, made us participants. Shearsmith tweeted “Are me and Steve Pemberton on BBC two now?” and people replied. Viewers’ real time reactions became part of the spectacle in a way that felt more profound than usual, possibly because what we had seen had been confounding enough to make speculation unavoidable. Co-star Stephanie Cole’s Wikipedia entry was altered to reflect her sad, on-screen suicide as the possessed studio continued to work its dark magic.Event TV is a term that is now lazily applied to everything from cookery shows to talent contests. But the Inside No 9 live special really did deserve that description. It is now on BBC iPlayer and is well worth a second (or indeed, first) look. But if you weren’t there at 10pm on Sunday, you missed the essence of it. What the show demonstrated was that in the hands of true masters, modern media networks like Twitter are simply more tools, more colours a writer can add to their palette. The show’s closest relative is probably BBC One’s spectacular 1992 Halloween epic Ghostwatch. But Ghostwatch was able to take advantage of less jaded, less media-savvy, more credulous times. To even approach its mischief and magic in 2018 feels like a triumph of imagination. It also feels like a vindication of the idea that in the right hands, TV still has the capacity to surprise, disconcert and delight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce32a8067a7a42bbccf5954e17387f260f9d6d1/0_296_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f040b92f814cdb75c38bf62e4cea1b","title":"bangladesh and myanmar agree to start rohingya repatriation in mid november","story":"Bangladesh and Myanmar to start returning refugees days after warning of continuing genocide against MuslimsMyanmar and Bangladesh have agreed to start the repatriation of Rohingya refugees next month, less than a week after UN investigators warned that a genocide against the Muslim minority was continuing.More than 720,000 of Myanmar’s stateless Rohingya people fled a military crackdown in August last year, taking shelter in crowded camps in Bangladesh and bringing with them harrowing tales of rape, murder and arson.At a meeting of the Bangladeshi foreign secretary, Shahidul Haque, and his Burmese counterpart, Myint Thu, on Tuesday, the two countries drew up a “very concrete plan” to start repatriations.“We have shown our political will, flexibility and accommodation in order to commence the repatriation at the earliest possible date,” Myint Thu told reporters. Authorities in Buddhist-majority Myanmar say more than 100 displaced Rohingyas have returned in recent months, but Bangladesh says the official process has not begun.Myint Thu’s comments were echoed by Haque, who said: “We are looking forward to starting the repatriation by mid-November.”Rohingya families who fled Myanmar have been living in cramped, makeshift refugee camps in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district. Bangladesh initially proved very welcoming to those fleeing the violence, but the burden of looking after the refugees has become politically contentious in the impoverished country.This is not the first time a date has been set for repatriation. A previous attempt, in November 2017, hit insurmountable obstacles. A year on, Rohingya living in the camps have the same fundamental questions about their safety if they return.Somsu Alom fled his village in northern Maungdaw in September last year after soldiers and Rakhine Buddhists set it alight, and now lives at Thaingkhali refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar with his wife and six children. He said his family was desperate to go home but “the situation in Rakhine is still unsafe” for Rohingyas.“In smaller groups, Rohingyas are still fleeing to Bangladesh. We cannot understand how they have announced that repatriation of the Rohingya refugees will begin in November. It’s very disappointing for us.”He described how those who had fled from Rahkine in recent weeks had recounted ongoing violence and a hostile environment for the Rohingya community still there.“The Rohingya still are not allowed to move around in Rakhine freely. Occasionally, Rohingya are still being targeted in violence and the hardship and threats are still forcing the remaining Rohingya to flee. We cannot return home in the current situation,” Alom said.There are also questions about the logistics of repatriation. Many Rohingya homes and villages were razed in the crackdown, so it is likely they would be relocated to new residences built by the government in Rahkine. It is unclear, however, whether they would have free movement or whether the homes would simply be “open air prisons”, as some human rights groups have suggested.Bangladesh reportedly handed Myanmar a list of 8,000 Rohingya refugees whom it had processed and were ready for repatriation earlier this year. Abul Faisal, 42, who fled his home in Maungdaw town in September last year, said there was confusion about who had even been cleared for return.“The authorities in Bangladesh collected names and other details of the Rohingya refugees living in Cox’s Bazar, but we were never told why,” he said. “Most importantly, I have not heard of any Rohingya refugee who was asked if he or she wanted to return home to Myanmar. So we do not know how the local authorities got those names of Rohingya for repatriation.”He emphasised that Rohingya demands for safety and citizenship had not been met by Myanmar authorities and described Rahkine as dangerous for the Muslim community. “The saddest fact is that neither Myanmar nor Bangladesh involved the Rohingya community in the negotiations for the repatriation.”Marzuki Darusman, chair of the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said last week that thousands of Rohingyas were still fleeing to Bangladesh had faced discrimination, and those who remain“continue to suffer the most severe” restrictions and repression.“It is an ongoing genocide that is taking place at the moment,” Darusman said.Myanmar signed a memorandum of understanding with the UN in June, which stipulated that certain conditions need to be met for repatriations to take place, including guaranteed security and a pathway to citizenship.The Rohingya community has lived in Myanmar for generations, but a 1982 law stripped it membersof their citizenship and made most of them stateless. No clear process for reinstating their citizenship has been demonstrated.There is also still widespread discrimination against the Rohingya by Buddhist citizens in Myanmar, and they are widely referred to as “Bengalis” by the government, inferring they are interlopers. A recent  visit to Rahkine state showed that Buddhist community leaders and citizens still refer to the Rohingya as terrorists and made it clear that “no one wants them to come back”.Myint Thu insisted the Myanmar government was working to eliminate such discrimination ahead of repatriation. “We have trained the police, different law and enforcement agencies in workshops, educating them against discrimination. Also, we have been raising awareness against such discriminations,” he said.Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency, recently said the organisation did not believe “that conditions are currently in place in Myanmar for voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of Rohingya refugees”.Additional reporting by Jacob Goldberg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e616286827f60f979da7ed2d05549aefb613bfc/0_118_4680_2808/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=842087f7f4ea1ac9a4bf615614758016","title":"swim england in deep water for swimsuits to flatter women advice","story":"National sports body removes web advice on ‘flabby stomachs’ and ‘too long torsos’ after student’s criticismSwim England’s guidance on choosing swimwear has been criticised for focusing too much on the shape of women’s bodies.The national governing body for swimming in England suggested on its website suitable costumes for female swimmers with short or long torsos, in the plus size bracket, with a “pear shape”, with a large or small bust, a “flabby stomach” or “boyish body”. The web page was later taken down.“Ensuring you have the right swimwear for body shape is vital. It’s important to be honest with yourself or the person you are buying for. It can make a world of difference,” the guidance noted.Simone Webb, a PhD student in gender studies, came across the guidance while searching for a swimsuit to buy. She said: “I was thinking about trying to swim again because I needed to get my cardio exercise up to track and wanted to do something warm and indoors. I was genuinely surprised and shocked that the national government body would have something like this on their website.”She said the guidance suggested that making women’s bodies look as close as possible to a particular feminine ideal was the most important thing when choosing clothing in sport. Although Swim England’s advice was aimed at encouraging people to swim, the guidance risked deterring women from the sport, she claimed.The guidance covered “swimwear material”, “know what the swimwear is for”, and “choosing swimwear for women by body shape”. The last section went into the greatest detail, but there was advice on appearance in other sections as well. Under swimwear material, the guidance told female swimmers: “If you have a bodily feature you like, use bright colours to highlight it. Alternatively, to hide a less loved feature, use solid colour.”Webb said: “I can’t quite work out how it got there in the first place. How did someone write that and thought yeah this is spot on?”A Swim England spokesperson said: “This was an old web page from 2010 that does not represent the views of Swim England. As soon as it was brought to our attention we removed the page and are in the process of replacing it with more appropriate information. Swimming is one of the most accessible activities for people of all ages and abilities. We want everyone to feel comfortable in the water and apologise for any offence this old information may have caused.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3680925.1540930407!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary school teachers reject government pay proposals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnnouncing the result of the ballot of INTO members on the two-tier pay system, general secretary Sheila Nunan said the proposal by Government failed to signal an end to pay inequality for all new entrants.  Photograph Nick BradshawPrimary school teachers have narrowly rejected new Government proposals to address the controversial two-tier pay system in schools. The move increases the potential for disruption in schools in the months ahead.In a ballot, members of the INTO voted against the Government initiative on new entrant pay by a margin of 53 per cent to 47 per cent. The turnout was 55 per cent.The union’s central executive will now consider its next steps, including a ballot for industrial action, at a meeting next week.Last month, the Government tabled proposals to end the system of those recruited since 2011 receiving lower pay than longer-serving colleagues by allowing those affected to catch up by jumping two increments on their pay scale over a number of years.The Government estimated the initiative would cost nearly €200 million by the time the process was completed in 2026.The INTO said on Tuesday that the vote of its members demonstrated the commitment of its members to secure pay equality.“The proposed agreement left several new entrant cohorts from 2011 onwards paid less than their colleagues and the membership has sought to stand in unity with their colleagues in demanding full restoration”, it said.INTO general secretary Sheila Nunan said: “Notwithstanding progress to date on pay equality, the proposed agreement by Government failed to signal an end to pay inequality for all new entrants. Acting in solidarity with their colleagues who are paid less for doing the same job, our membership has signalled that they will not stand for any agreement which leaves them in a similar position.”“The central executive committee (CEC) will meet next week to consider the result of the ballot and decide how best to proceed including a ballot for industrial action.”Last week members of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) voted to support the Government’s pay initiative in a ballot by 53 per cent to 47 per cent. However the union maintained the Government’s proposals, in themselves, would not bring an end of pay inequality .The TUI said the proposals “do not deliver pay equality and will not tackle the recruitment and retention crisis currently afflicting second level schools”.A vote by members of a third education union, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) is expected next month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3679782.1540918913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of refused british applications for irish passports in double digits","story":"Speaking at meeting of foreign ministers in mid-October in Luxembourg, Tánaiste Simon Coveney called on the British government to follow through on commitments made in Brexit talks. Video: EU Council\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorldwide, the number of applications for Irish passports received from outside the State surged from 190,905 in 2016 to 227,223 last year. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe number of Irish passport applications from British residents refused last year is understood to be in “double digits”.The Department of Foreign Affairs received 80,752 applications from British residents last year, according to figures released by Tánaiste Simon Coveney. A total of 65,678 passports were issued through the Irish embassy in London,The Department said that while the difference is 15,074 not all applications are submitted through the Irish embassy.In 2016 a total of 63,453 British residents applied for passports. The Irish embassy in London issued 63,452.The difference that year was just one passport fewer than the overall number of applications from British residents.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy in reply to a parliamentary question that the Passport Service does not compile data on the number of applications refused but that in general it was “small”.Sources in the Department of Foreign Affairs said the number of refusals was in “double digits”. Mr Coveney said that all passport applications had to meet the requirements of the amended 2008 Passport Act. “Section 12 of the Act, makes provision to refuse a passport in certain circumstances.”He said that “in all cases, the Passport Service must be satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and that the applicant is an Irish citizen”.Where applications were incomplete, applicants would often be contacted for clarifications or requested to provide further documentation. Difficulties can also arise in applications for minors. “All s must provide consent for a minor’s application or if unavailable or unwilling, submit a court order as appropriate,” Mr Coveney said. Worldwide, the number of applications for Irish passports received from outside the State surged from 190,905 in 2016 to 227,223 last year and up to the end of September this year had hit 191,271.Mr Coveney said that in the 18 months since the online passport application service was launched in March last year 270,187 passports were issued using this procedure. Overall hundreds of thousands of UK residents have applied for Irish passports since Britain voted for Brexit and the rate of applications continues to increase.Statistics supplied to Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond by the Irish Embassy in London show that the number of passport applications from the UK has risen significantly since the year before the Brexit vote.In 2015 there were almost 99,944 applications from Britain and Northern Ireland, a figure that rose to 131,035 the following year. In 2017 there was a further increase of over 30,000 applications to 163,026.And figures this year to the end of May show 91,860 applications were made.The number of people from the North who applied for an Irish passport rose from 53,715 in 2015 to 67,582 the following year.Applications jumped again last year to 82,274 and up to the end of May this year 46,898 people in the North applied for Irish passports.“Embassy officials predict that based on this, 2018 will be the busiest year so far for Irish passport applications in the UK,” Mr Richmond said.People born to Irish parents or grandparents are entitled to apply for an Irish passport through a claim to citizenship.“At least 10 per cent of the UK’s population, not including Northern Ireland, are estimated to qualify for an Irish passport and in light of Brexit” many were “staking their claim” to the passport, Mr Richmond said.Mr Richmond said that “while many in the UK are concerned with the looming disaster of Brexit, we must seize the positives from this new wave of people reconnecting with their Irish heritage, our post-Brexit UK-Irish relations can be built on a strong, connected diaspora”.In contrast, applications from the Irish diaspora elsewhere around the world have dropped slightly.Ms Murphy noted that the number of applications has fallen annually since 2016 in locations with significant Irish populations including New York, San Francisco and Boston in the US although there has been an increase in applications to the Chicago consulate from 1,126 in 2016 to 2,046 last year and 1,435 up to the end of September this year.Applications outside the EU are also falling including those from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, United Arab Emirates, China and Japan.In Africa, applications from Nigeria, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tanzania have also fallen. In Kenya, there were no applications in 2016 or last year but four this year.This article was changed on October 30th, 2018 to reflect clarification received from the Department of Foreign Affairs on the reason for the difference between the number of British applications for passports and the number of passports issued by the Irish Embassy in London."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

The wildlife does not disappear. And everybody beyond the rank of turning a shovel doesn\u0027t come from the US to do that job... Oh, and by the way, we don\u0027t leave the country billions of dollars in debt.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pick up poo or we take the dog: Chinese city rolls out \u0026#39social credit\u0026#39 system for pet owners3,000-year-old Assyrian palace artifact goes on sale at auction in New YorkDeng Xiaoping’s son urges China to ‘know its place’ in counterpoint to Xi\u0026#39s expansionist foreign policyComment: There\u0026#39s nothing fair about the way the \u0026#34rich\u0026#34 are treated by the tax systemNotorious Boston gangster James \u0026#39Whitey\u0026#39 Bulger killed in jailBelgian research could replace USB sticks with data stored in powderPhilip Hammond accused of stealth tax raid on middle England with National Insurance hikesHyde Park bomber has transferred assets into wives name and refuses to reveal where he lives, court hearsLethal drugs can be bought online in just five minutes, health watchdog warnsNato says Norway exercises will go ahead despite Russian missile tests off the coastBrexit latest: Norway pours cold water on EEA model as Theresa May meets Nordic leaders - live updatesPittsburgh\u0026#39s Jewish community tells Donald Trump to stay away as first victims\u0026#39 funerals take placeRussia\u0026#39s only aircraft carrier damaged whilst undergoing repairs after floating dry dock collapsesTalking Strictly podcast: Faye Tozer, Hallowe\u0026#39en curses and the end of kissgateNavy commander accused of sexually assaulting colleague cleared in 57 minutesComment: Miserable John McDonnell: the greatest character Dickens never createdSwim England apologises over advice to women on how to hide \u0026#39flabby stomachs\u0026#39 and \u0026#39boyish bodies\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000027014573_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4cHFBfxHqfroyKoKkNhhsByS1DQrn_Wl7Sp7sNOKUT0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hyde park bomber has transferred assets wives name refuses reveal","story":"John Downey has refused to officially inform the court of his home addressAn alleged IRA bomber accused of the 1982 Hyde Park bombing showed his contempt for British justice yesterday by refusing to appear in court to hear claims for damages against him by the families of those he stands accused of killing.The family of one of the four Royal Household Cavalrymen who died in the blast launched a civil action against John Downey in the High Court yesterday.Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, 19, Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, 36, Lieutenant Dennis Daly, 23, and Trooper Simon Tipper, 19, were killed by a car bomb as they rode through the park to attend the changing of the guard.Mr Downey, who has always denied responsibility for their deaths, walked free from the Old Bailey in 2014 after it emerged he had received a so-called ‘comfort’ or ‘on the run’ letter dating back to 2007 as part of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal.The trial judge ruled that the letter given to Mr Downey guaranteed he would not face trial and that to proceed was an abuse of executive power.The 187 ‘comfort’ letters were given to IRA suspects in a secret deal agreed between Tony Blair’s government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.Lance Crpl Young’s family have now launched a civil claim for compensation against Mr Downey on behalf of all the families, in a case that is expected to take more than a year to complete.But Mr Downey is refusing to either appear in court in person or to instruct a legal representative to appear on his behalf. He has also indicated he has no intention of recognising the jurisdiction of the court in this matter.A bomb exploded as the Household Cavalry was passingMr Downey, now 66, has also refused to officially inform the court of his home address, forcing the families’ solicitors to communicate with him via email.Anne Studd, QC, counsel for Mr Young’s family, told a preliminary hearing in front of Master Davison: “He (Downey) says that at the moment he is not going to participate. He has not been willing to tell us where he is.”The High Court heard confirmation of revelations by the Daily  earlier this year that Mr Downey has transferred part of his assets to his wife, including a share in their home in Co. Donegal, Ireland, in an apparent attempt to avoid paying any damages awarded against him.Ms Studd told Master Davison that Mr Downey had transferred part of one property to another person and part of another property built nearby, to his wife.Yesterday’s hearing came after this newspaper revealed how Irish Land registry documents showed that Mr Downey removed his name from ownership of this second house, worth £300,000, on June 7 last year, just as lawyers for victims of Hyde Park bombing were preparing the civil case against him.Nevertheless Ms Studd told the court that she was confident that would not stop the families seeking compensation from him.“We are reasonably confident he has assets to which a judgment could be attached,” she said, pointing out there are “reciprocal arrangements” in place with the Irish republic to allow the British authorities to pursue Mr Downey for any compensation payments ordered by the courts.Crpl Young’s daughter Sarah-Jane, has previously criticised what critics have described as the “hounding” of British soldiers by the authorities for actions they carried out on active service in Northern Ireland.Ms Young, who brought the civil damages claim against Mr Downey in the wake of the collapsed trial, told the : “It’s appalling and disgusting. He is the chief suspect in my father’s death but is able to enjoy his retirement.  It makes me upset that the Government have been treating our boys like this by allowing police to investigate them. It is really appalling.”Lance Coporal Jeffery Young one of the soldiers who was killed in the blastMs Young, now aged 40, remembers witnessing the aftermath of the atrocity as a child aged four, when she watched injured soldiers returning from the bombing past her nursery. Her father was just 19 when he died.Mr Downey lives in a remote corner of County Donegal, overlooking a beach on a picturesque inlet a few miles from north west Ireland’s rugged Atlantic coastline.He has spent the past two years building his new house, following the sale of another property a few hundred yards along the road. He made much of his money by setting up a business supplying oysters from the local waters to the retail and restaurant trade, which he ran with his wife until 2011.When the  approached him Mr Downey refused to comment, saying only: “No, no thank you” before shutting his front door.It was indicated in court yesterday that Mr Downey may object to the case against him as ‘an abuse of process’ and argue that too much time has past since the events in question for him to receive a fair hearing.In a rare interview given by Mr Downey to his local newspaper, the Donegal Democrat, after his trial collapsed, he called for the establishment of an international truth commission as a way to safeguard the peace process.The row over the contrasting treatment of troops and suspected terrorists has been reignited by the ongoing police investigations into Army veterans.The  disclosed earlier this year how a 76-year-old former paratrooper was interviewed under caution for attempted murder for firing his rifle and dislodging masonry which may have hit two protesters, possibly injuring them, during the Bloody Sunday riot in 1972 in Londonderry in which 14 civilians were killed.Pick up poo or we take the dog: Chinese city rolls out \u0026#39social credit\u0026#39 system for pet owners3,000-year-old Assyrian palace artifact goes on sale at auction in New YorkDeng Xiaoping’s son urges China to ‘know its place’ in counterpoint to Xi\u0026#39s expansionist foreign policyComment: There\u0026#39s nothing fair about the way the \u0026#34rich\u0026#34 are treated by the tax systemNotorious Boston gangster James \u0026#39Whitey\u0026#39 Bulger killed in jailBelgian research could replace USB sticks with data stored in powderPhilip Hammond accused of stealth tax raid on middle England with National Insurance hikesLethal drugs can be bought online in just five minutes, health watchdog warnsNato says Norway exercises will go ahead despite Russian missile tests off the coastBrexit latest: Norway pours cold water on EEA model as Theresa May meets Nordic leaders -

You should be supporting swimmers of all abilities, shapes, and sizes, not shaming them!Swim England responded to criticism, and said in a statement:  “Thank you for bringing this to our attention. This is an old web page that does not represent the views of Swim England and the content has now been removed. We apologise for any offence caused and hope this doesn’t put you off swimming.”Please review our commenting policy3,000-year-old Assyrian palace artifact goes on sale at auction in New YorkDeng Xiaoping’s son urges China to ‘know its place’ in counterpoint to Xi\u0026#39s expansionist foreign policyComment: There\u0026#39s nothing fair about the way the \u0026#34rich\u0026#34 are treated by the tax systemNotorious Boston gangster James \u0026#39Whitey\u0026#39 Bulger killed in jailBelgian research could replace USB sticks with data stored in powderPhilip Hammond accused of stealth tax raid on middle England with National Insurance hikesHyde Park bomber has transferred assets into wives name and refuses to reveal where he lives, court hearsLethal drugs can be bought online in just five minutes, health watchdog warnsNato says Norway exercises will go ahead despite Russian missile tests off the coastBrexit latest: Norway pours cold water on EEA model as Theresa May meets Nordic leaders - live updatesPittsburgh\u0026#39s Jewish community tells Donald Trump to stay away as first victims\u0026#39 funerals take placeRussia\u0026#39s only aircraft carrier damaged whilst undergoing repairs after floating dry dock collapsesTalking Strictly podcast: Faye Tozer, Hallowe\u0026#39en curses and the end of kissgateNavy commander accused of sexually assaulting colleague cleared in 57 minutesComment: Miserable John McDonnell: the greatest character Dickens never createdFather who \u0026#39deliberately\u0026#39 infected two women with HIV claims he was contaminated when a man sexually abused himCat or crow: Latest online optical illusion is so good that even Google\u0026#39s AI algorithms can\u0026#39t work it outWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/30/16/irpower.jpg","title":"airpower release date where announcement apple event iphone airpods","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsAn AirPower wireless charger is displayed along with other products during an Apple launch event in Cupertino, CaliforniaUpdated AirPods\u0026nbsphave also failed to turn up for the much-rumoured release dateClick to followThe Independent TechApple did not release its AirPower charging mat at its latest event, despite first showing off the technology with a showy video more than a year ago.The wireless charging pad was unveiled alongside the iPhone X and 8, as a way of embracing their wireless charging capability.

And it adds new features, like the Apple Watch charging, which will not work on any third-party chargers.Apple also said it would be able to charge up the AirPod wireless earphone, using a special new case. That also did not arrive at the event.The AirPower\u0027s\u0026nbspstandout feature is that it is able to charge three different products at once, using a wide variety of charging technology. And those products can be placed absolutely anywhere on the wide mat.It is thought to be that complicated system that has taken Apple so long to develop.Apple is rumoured to be potentially holding another event next month. But it is expected to unveil new iPads\u0026nbspand Macs at that launch, making it unlikely that the iPhone accessory is being saved until then.This article was originally published in September, after Apple\u0027s iPhone event. It has been updated and re-published, after the October event passed without any mention of AirPower at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is available to order now ahead of a release date on 7 November.Alongside the MacBook Air came a new Mac Pro, which benefits from the same recycled metals, a new look, and vastly upgraded internals. Both the Mac Mini and the MacBook Air have been neglected for years, with so little attention that some feared it was more likely they would be killed off than refreshed.The iPad Pro came with a similarly radical redesign, which removes the home button from the bottom and almost entirely gets rid of the bezel that has traditionally wrapped around the sides of the screen. That also meant Apple brought a\u0026nbspnew way\u0026nbspof unlocking it, with the introduction of Apple\u0027s Face ID facial recognition technology into the tablet for the first time ever.Apple removed the Lightning port on the bottom of the iPad, and swapped it for USB-C. That has been used on some of Apple\u0027s laptops, but will mean that owners will no longer be able to charge their iPad and iPhone with the same cable.iPad ProApple also introduced an upgraded version of the Apple Pencil, which was first introduced with the first iPad Pro. It now charges by clicking onto the top of the tablet, and features a button on the side that can be press for extra controls.Alongside that came a new look for the Smart Keyboard that is sold alongside the iPad Pro.The new iPad\u0026nbspPro comes in two sizes: an 11-inch version, which because of the smaller bezel takes up the same space as the previous 10.5-inch one, and a bigger 12.9-inch size.The smaller one starts at $769 and the bigger\u0026nbspat\u0026nbsp$969. Both are available to order now and will also go on sale on 7 November.Below is our live blog from the event, detailing Apple\u0027s announcements as they happened.Apple is holding its October event in New York this year. Leaving California is a strange decision, especially when the company relatively recently opened the Steve Jobs Theater that was built specifically for this kind of launch. But it\u0027s probably doing so because of the venue: the Brooklyn Academy of Music. That has a beautiful, old theatre, and is presumably part of an effort to emphasise creativity that is also in keeping with the iPad Pro and the unique Apple-themed invites that were created for each invitee.\u0026nbspTo add to the weirdness, the timings are all a little strange. In part that\u0027s because of the location – the timezone means that everything will be happening earlier than usual, when it\u0027s held on the West Coast – but also because the US is still in summer time when the UK isn\u0027t, meaning the gap is only four hours compared to the usual five.The Apple Store is DOWN, so you can\u0027t buy anything new even if you wanted to. (That includes the brand new iPhones.)\u0026nbspIt used to be said that Apple had to do this, because its ancient back-end meant that it couldn\u0027t put new products up on the shop without taking it down entirely. But the site got a redesign relatively recently and you would have thought that would have been fixed.\u0026nbspSo now it\u0027s not clear why it happens, but it does, every single time. Do they just want to build anticipation ahead of the event? Does it still need all that time to be fixed up instead? Or are they being nice, making sure that people don\u0027t buy products that are just about to be overtaken by something new?Here\u0027s some more detail on the Brooklyn Academy of Music, from the Ibrahim Salha, the Independent\u0027s head of audience and former New Yorker:\u0026nbspI\u0027m a former BAM member, and I think Apple have done brilliantly in choosing the venue for their latest event. It\u0027s a stunning space, as Andrew points out, and will make for quite a departure from the usual announcement live streams we tune in to. Depending on how long the event lasts, attendees can nip in to one of the movie theatres and watch A Star Is Born, or go for a wander around Brooklyn. I recommend the Cesar\u0027s Empanadas food truck – worth waiting in line for.Apple will be livestreaming the event, of course. And you can find that here.Sorry, I was wrong: not just\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspApple logo. A whole big selection of them, presumably from the same pool that Apple used to send out unique invites to all of the attendees today.\u0026nbspSome of them are actually pretty nice and oddly satisfying. So maybe you do want to fire up the live stream now, despite there being another seven minutes to go. Again, if you do, click here.Into our first thing: the Mac.Going through a rundown of what\u0027s new in MacOS Mojave. You can find all of that in our round-up, here.Our customers love their Macs.

Bitcoins can only come into existence if a computer “mines” them, which means the computer must solve complex math equations, sucking up electricity. Part of the economic draw of Bitcoin is that it cannot be produced easily or cheaply, meaning it is unlikely that it will be mined so quickly that it loses value. There is also a cap on Bitcoin production: there will only be 21 million in total.Mining one bitcoin “could take as much energy in that transaction to power your house for months”, said Jon Truby, Director of the Centre for Law and Development at Qatar University. “Right now, that’s not sustainable.”It is hard to predict the future of Bitcoin: it is highly volatile and is sometimes worth less than the amount of money it costs to mine. The difficulty of the equation that the computer has to solve can also make mining bitcoins take more energy. Many economists suggests that the value will increase, and it is possible that technology could also improve mining efficiency in the future. Some argue that cash is also environmentally destructive.Alternatively, maybe mining Bitcoins will eventually become more efficient and use less energy. “The mining efficiency has been improving quite a lot,” Camilo Mora, lead author of the study, said. “That is because you make more money there. That is something that the mining companies have tried to push hard.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A scavenger collects recyclable materials along the breakwater amid strong waves as weather patterns from Typhoon Yutu affect Manila Bay.

This is evidenced by bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency turning 10, and by more and more governments, regulators, financial institutions, and retail and institutional investors, amongst others, appreciating the real and growing demand for digital, global currencies in today’s ever more digitalised and globalised world, he said.\u0026nbspThis is\u0026nbspalso underscored by the UK government Cryptoassets Taskforce’s final report which states that ‘the market is continuing to evolve rapidly\u0027, before adding ‘there is increasing institutional investment in this space, and many banks are starting to explore how they can interact with this growing market’.\u0026nbspThe report’s proactive and pragmatic approach towards regulation of the burgeoning sector should be championed.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The cycling chain has 60 branches across the UK, and employs more than 1,000 people. In 2015, Evans was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners for £75m, however in recent months it has been scrambling to find new ownership and a £10m cash injection.

No purchase price has been disclosed.\u0026nbspMr Ashley said: We are pleased to have rescued the Evans Cycles brand. However, in order to save the business we only believe we will be able to keep 50 per cent of stores open in the future. Unfortunately some stores will have to close.”Matt Callaghan, PwC partner and joint administrator for Evans, said: “2018 has been a very difficult trading year for the business, in part due to the impact of the extended winter weather in the early part of the year and a lack of cash to invest in stores and develop the online platform.“A combination of losses, the capital expenditure requirements and tightening credit has led to a liquidity crunch.”He added: “Evans is a long-standing, well known and trusted brand with nearly 100 years of heritage in the cycling market. To have managed to preserve the business and transfer all staff to the purchaser is particularly pleasing.”James Keany at CBRE has been retained on all property related aspects, Sports Direct said.Mr Keany said: We are looking forward to working with landlords in order to help create a sustainable business. We will make contact with landlords over the next few days and discuss the future of inidual stores.Mr Ashley has been adding to his retail empire recently, buying House of Fraser out of administration for £90m in August. He has managed to save a number of House of Fraser stores previously earmarked for closure, but has apparently clashed with landlords at other locations.A spokesperson for House of Fraser said recently: “Some landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs.“However, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people.“We will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out.

In 2015, Evans was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners for £75m, however in recent months it has been scrambling to find new ownership and a £10m cash injection. House of Fraser blames ‘greedy landlords’ for store closure risksMike Ashley needs a new approach to make House of Fraser like HarrodsMike Ashley\u0027s House of Fraser deal boosts Debenhams with merger hopesA pre-pack administration process allows the sale of an insolvent business before administrators have been appointed. \u0026nbspEvans was previously reported to be fielding offers from rival Halfords, JD Sports, and a number of others, but\u0026nbspMike Ashley won out. No purchase price has been disclosed.\u0026nbspMr Ashley said: We are pleased to have rescued the Evans Cycles brand. However, in order to save the business we only believe we will be able to keep 50 per cent of stores open in the future. Unfortunately some stores will have to close.”Matt Callaghan, PwC partner and joint administrator for Evans, said: “2018 has been a very difficult trading year for the business, in part due to the impact of the extended winter weather in the early part of the year and a lack of cash to invest in stores and develop the online platform.“A combination of losses, the capital expenditure requirements and tightening credit has led to a liquidity crunch.”He added: “Evans is a long-standing, well known and trusted brand with nearly 100 years of heritage in the cycling market. To have managed to preserve the business and transfer all staff to the purchaser is particularly pleasing.”James Keany at CBRE has been retained on all property related aspects, Sports Direct said.Mr Keany said: We are looking forward to working with landlords in order to help create a sustainable business. We will make contact with landlords over the next few days and discuss the future of inidual stores.Mr Ashley has been adding to his retail empire recently, buying House of Fraser out of administration for £90m in August. He has managed to save a number of House of Fraser stores previously earmarked for closure, but has apparently clashed with landlords at other locations.A spokesperson for House of Fraser said recently: “Some landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs.“However, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people.“We will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out. Some closures will be announced.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They each try to collect the most spirits they can and then carry them back to their base, in two minutes, at which point the round comes to an end and a winner is declared.Google Doodle reveals the most searched for recipes in every stateBut it\u0027s also more complicated than that: the game offers a wide variety of different maps, as well as powerups that make it a little more varied. Players can get the ability to move around more quickly or to see in the dark, for instance.As well as being able to play in teams – either with strangers or people you know – each player is given personal awards depending on how they\u0027ve done.Special technologies had to be built to allow for the first multiplayer version of the game, Google said. The team built several systems to enable this multiplayer gaming, all running on the Google Cloud Platform, including integrating Open Match, a highly-scalable, open source matchmaking framework cofounded by Google Cloud and Unity, it wrote in a blog post announcing the new game.The Doodle is showing around almost all of the world – though not in Africa and some specific countries – and will presumably stick around until Halloween is over.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The smaller 11-inch takes up the same size as the existing 10.50-inch, using the extra space from the smaller bezels to pack in a bigger display the bigger 12.9-inch is the same screen size but has been reduced overall.Inside, it includes Apple\u0027s latest A12X bionic chip, which is an upgraded version of the processor in the iPhone XS and XR. It said that and other upgrades allow the new Pro to rival the Xbox One S for gaming performance, which it displayed by showing the latest version of the NBA 2K series.As well as those changes, Apple also swapped out the Lightning port that has traditionally been on the bottom of the iPad. In its place comes a USB-C port, which means that the tablet can be plugged into accessories like cameras or musical equipment – as well as charging the iPhone.The new iPads are available to order now, ahead of their full release on 7 November. The smaller one costs $769 or the same number of pounds, and the bigger one is $969.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also has a new microphone, which allows people to sound better on FaceTime calls as well as being used for Siri, which is always listening and can be activated just by saying Hey Siri at any time.The MacBook Air will start at $1199, considerably more expensive than the old version of the computer. It can be pre-ordered now and will arrive on 7 November.But Apple appeared to be most proud of its new way of making aluminium, which allows it to make the computers using entirely recycled metal. That is why Apple is referring to the computer as its greenest ever Mac.The new MacBook Air was revealed at the same time Apple also revealed a new Mac Mini.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

That would not be in the national interest.”Some observers believe that the Budget announced by Philip Hammond on Monday resembled a pre-election budget, with accelerated income tax cuts and some other popular measures.Fresh elections could be tempting because the Prime Minister lacks a majority in the House of Commons, meaning there is a good chance any Brexit deal she negotiates could be voted down.Though she secured the support of the right-wing\u0026nbspDUP with an extra £1 billion for Northern Ireland after the 2017 election, the party has since said it would not vote for an emerging deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.But with the Conservatives yet to open up a\u0026nbspsubstantial lead in the polls – and memories of last year’s shock result still fresh –\u0026nbspthe PM appears yet to be tempted.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

China was a high profile participant at the summit.Now Beijing has astounded leading wildlife organisations by diluting a 25-year moratorium on tiger bones and rhino horn, both hailed as traditional panaceas for a range of ailments.China\u0026rsquos State Council has issued rules that while banning the sale, import and export of the animal parts has a \u0026ldquospecial circumstances proviso.                ZOO FROM HELL: Lions and three-legged bear rescued This allows rhino horn and the bones of tigers bred in captivity to be used \u0026ldquofor medical research or clinical treatment of critical illnesses.The ruling also allows antique horn and tiger parts to be used in cultural exchanges with the authorities\u0026rsquo approval although they cannot go on open sale.Hospitals will be able to obtain animal body parts from China\u0026rsquos captive facilities \u0026ndash although not zoos \u0026ndash where both animals are bred. It is estimated that as many as 6,500 of the big cats live in China\u0026rsquos infamous but legal tiger farms, a number far exceeding the estimated 3,900 left in the wild.Using tiger bones in medicine was outlawed by China in 1993 but there has long been groundswell inside the country that the ban threatens ancient Oriental medicine.Poached tiger mutilated for its precious body parts (Image: )Reaction has been swift to the Chinese decision, with WWF describing it as an \u0026ldquoenormous setback for wildlife conservation and a reversal of efforts that have saved rhinos and tigers from extinction.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoChina\u0026rsquos decision to reopen a legalised trade in farmed tiger bone and rhino horn reverses 25 years of conservation progress in reducing the demand for these products in traditional Chinese medicine and improving the effectiveness of law enforcement, said Leigh Henry, director of wildlife policy, WWF-US.\u0026ldquoThis devastating reversal by China runs completely counter to the image of wildlife champion the world had come to expect with China\u0026rsquos ivory trade ban, which was such a positive development for the world\u0026rsquos elephants.What worries environmental groups is that any trade in captive products will fuel demands to plunder endangered animals in the wild. Another sour point is the 2010 declaration by the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies which urged members against using such wildlife products.Rare one-horned rhino poached in Indian refuge (Image: Getty)Iris Ho, senior specialist for wildlife programme and policy at Humane Society International, warned: \u0026ldquoWith this announcement, the Chinese government has signed a death warrant for imperilled rhinos and tigers in the wild who already face myriad threats to their survival.\u0026ldquoIt sets up what is essentially a laundering scheme for illegal tiger bone and rhino horn to enter the marketplace and further perpetuate the demand for these animal parts. This is a devastating blow to our ongoing work to save species from cruel exploitation and extinction, and we implore the Chinese government to reconsider.Conservation groups say Chinese traditional medicine recipes can make use of substitutes for products from wild animals.

The measures I set out yesterday are the right measures for Britain, we will be enacting them in a Finance Bill.I\u0027m very confident that we will get a deal with the EU and what I said yesterday is that if we get that deal, because there will be a benefit to the economy from getting that deal, I hope we will be able to do a little bit better still than I set out yesterday, with a bit more money for public services when we have our Spending Review next year, and perhaps a bit more available going forward for some more tax cuts.8.11am update: Hammond\u0027s \u0026pound500million cash boost for Brexit\u0026nbspMr Hammond on Monday announced a\u0026nbsp\u0026pound500million cash boost for Brexit, in a strong message to EU chiefs.During his last budget speech before Britain formerly leaves the EU, Mr Hammond also laid out a \u0026ldquothree-pronged to deal with Brexit.The chancellor said that the \u0026pound3.7billion already allocated to Whitehall for contingency planning would need to rise by another \u0026pound500million.This means Philip Hammond has earmarked \u0026pound4.2billion on Britain\u0026rsquos exit from the Brussels bloc between 2016 and 2020.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This will mean that the government’s flagship welfare reform is now more generous than the benefit system that it is replacing.While today’s reforms certainly won’t end all the problems some recipients have faced with Universal Credit, they should ease the rollout in the months and years ahead.But Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd said it wouldnt cover all the costs of the Osborne cuts., and there were still issues with the new system.He raged: UC’s serious design flaws were also not addressed, from long waiting times that are pushing people into indebtedness, to problems in how landlords are paid housing benefit.The pain caused by the roll-out of UC is not over yet.Today we revealed how a single mum is at risk of homelessness after going on to the new system - and isnt eligible for help with her mortgage debt payments.Tina Davidson says she feels tossed aside by the system and has had to put the house shes lived in for  years up for sale to pay off debts.The new system is designed to try and get more Brits into work and less reliant on the welfare system, but its been beset with problems.Many say its pushing them into debt as the wait for the first payment is at least five weeks.Others say they were driven to payday loans and even prostitution to try and make ends meet.Ministers say they are constantly trying to fix the systems problems as they go along - and the new system is much less complicated than the old one.It was reported earlier this month that ministers are planning moves to slow down the roll out to try and fix some of the issues.They can take out emergency loans, but have to start paying them back immediately so they get deducted from their benefits.Highlights of todays Budget include:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443835583.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"budget 2018 national living wage to rise to 8 21 from april 2019 meaning 690 a year","story":"The Chancellor said today he would hike the National Living Wage once again - up from £. - but it wont affect everyone.Its a five per cent hike, which will come into force from April, and will benefit around .million workers.Mr Hammond said today: From April [the National Living Wage] will rise again, handing a full-time worker a £ annual pay increase.But experts said it was still below what many need to live on - what they called a real living wage.And it doesnt apply to those under  either.Tess Lanning, Director of the Living Wage Foundation, said:“Today’s announcement of the rise in the government minimum wage is a welcome step towards closing the gap with the real Living Wage based on what people need to make ends meet.But the number of people paid less than the real Living Wage has increased this year, with millions of workers struggling to keep their heads above water. That’s why, more than ever, we need more employers to step up and commit to pay the real Living Wage, not just the government minimum.”Bryan Sanderson, chair of the Low Pay Commission, said: “The increase in the National Living Wageto £. in April  will ensure a pay rise for the lowest-paid workers that exceeds both inflation and average earnings.“Over the past year, the labour market has continued to perform well and the economy, while subdued, has met the criteria of ‘sustained growth’ set out in our remit for the NLW.

A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A big, welcome cut in business rates for struggling firms.New ideas flowed: a levy on web giants’ UK revenues, potentially raising £million, is long overdue — though Philip Hammond must ensure the ­burden does not fall on online shoppers.There was major funding to help councils transform our hollowed-out High Streets, including turning vacant shops into homes.

I didn’t feel drunk, I felt fine to drive - I didn’t think I was taking a risk. I gave my colleague a lt home, which I wouldn’t have doneI felt drunk.But the road was full of potholes. It did occur to me that I hope the police don’t think I am a drunk driver because I am swerving to avoid the potholes. I have had four punctures in two years on that car from potholes.But I didn’t think I caused the police van to swerve. The police woman told me to open my car and I told her that I needed to shut the car door to turn off the engine - I did struggle to get the car keys out when I did this.I told the officer from the very beginning that I had been drinking, but it was only one gin and tonic and a glass of Prosecco over the course of a three course meal.

Many public services are going to feel squeezed for some time to come.Cuts are not about to be reversed. If I were a prison governor, a local authority chief executive or a headteacher I would struggle to find much to celebrate. I would be preparing for more dficult years ahead.He said the Budget was a bit of a gamble as Mr Hammond took advantage of unexpected improvements in the public finances - and warned the gamble could backfire.Mr Johnson said there was a one in three chance that the public finances could get worse next year, and predicted the Chancellor would have to ramp up borrowing even though Britains debt already stands at an eye-watering £.trillion.He said: Any idea that there is a serious desire to eliminate the deficit by the mid-s is surely for the birds.The economist described how Mr Hammond had increased funds for the NHS and Universal Credit, while keeping most other spending flat.He concluded: Does that add up to the end of austerity  On a narrow definition perhaps it does, on wider definitions it doesn’t - at least not yet.Assessing the impact of Mr Hammonds tax cuts, Mr Johnson revealed that million Brits have been taken out of income tax altogether thanks to Tory policies over the past eight years.The Chancellor today claimed he would pump even more cash into the economywe end up quitting the EU without a Brexit deal.Speaking this morning, he admitted his plans would involve higher public spending to help the economy remain stable.Mr Hammond told the BBC: If the economy suffers a shock - and a No Deal Brexit is an example of a shock... we will deal with it in the usual way.Very often a shock to the economy actually requires a boost to spending in the short term to support demand and to keep the economy going.He added thatBritain and the EU do strike a good deal, spending could rise anyway as the economy grows.Speaking in Norway, Theresa May backed Mr Hammonds approach of mixing more spending with cuts to taxes - saying: Austerity coming to an end isnt just about more money into our public services, its about more money in peoples pockets as well.Yesterday, we confirmed that announcement that we had made in the summer of giving the biggest single injection of extra money into our National Health Service in its history.When we first said it in the summer we suggested we might have to raise taxes, we would have to raise taxes, to fund part of that.What was clear in the Budget yesterday is we have fully funded that - extra money into our NHS and not raising taxes.Indeed, we have cut taxes for million people.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accused Mr Hammond of handing out tax cuts in order to buy off voters ahead of a possible snap election.He said: The Tories usually do this. If a General Election is coming, what theyll do is theyll splash out some money and thenthey win the election they then start cutting it back again.Mr Hammond denied trying to bribe the electorate, saying: What we are preparing for is Britains future.Weve now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news.He also insisted he is still hoping to balance the Budget despite cutting taxes and increasing spending.A snap opinion poll shows that most Brits back the Chancellors decision to turn on the spending taps after eight years of austerity.Some  per cent said boosting public services should be Mr Hammonds priority, with only  per cent calling for more deficit reduction.But critics today accused the Budget of squeezing poorer workers and forcing the burden of austerity on to women.The left-wing Resolution Foundation thinktank said  per cent of the tax cuts will go to wealthier families.Director Torsten Bell said: Income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long-term gains going to the top ten per cent of households.On public services, the NHS saw a big-spending boost - but unprotected departments still have further cuts pencilled in.And senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper claimed  per cent of the impact of austerity had fallen on women - adding: The gender gap in the Tories tax and benefit policies is getting worse."},{"url":null,"title":"boy crystal meth seizure halloween galion ohio","story":"Braylen Carwell, from Galion, Ohio, began shaking when he ed from collecting candy on Sunday and was rushed to hospital.While it was initially thought his sweets has been tainted with meth, the boy insists the only thing he put in his mouth before the seizure was a pair of plastic vampire teeth.Police have sent the novelty dentures, which he was given while out trick-or-treating, away to be tested.Investigators also retrieved the sweets which Braylen had been given and collected them as evidence after his parents had thrown them out.His mother Julia Pence described the moment her son began having a seizure.She told Fox : “The left side of his face was just droopy and then he fell and then he couldn’t move his left arm.“And he didn’t know where he was, he didn’t know what he was doing.”Julia says the little boy is still feeling the effects from the powerful drug.She said: “You can tell he is still coming down from it because one minute he is all hyper and the next minute he is tired.The distraught mother admitted to cops that she and the boy’s father are recovering drug addicts, reports TV.But she insists they have both been sober for sometime and strongly denied having anything to do with Braylen’s positive drugs test.She said: “Im not covering up the truth.

He later decided to hone his craft by visiting other cities.Chris said: Some cities were full of characters, such as Brighton, and it was easy to get lots of good pictures, but others I had to keep ing to until I got what I needed. Ive tried to capture a snapshot of a day in each of the cities.He added that sometimes it would be frustratingsomeone walked in front of the camera at the wrong time or he missed the moment, but other pictures would then make up for it.He added: My near misses would fill another book, but any moments of dejection and self-doubt are soon forgotten when I see a man in Newcastle wearing a pink suit and a horses head, or a pensioner walking around Nottingham with an owl on his arm, as you do.I cannot resist snapping the drunken hens and their inevitable here I am, tadar! pose. Every town too has its fire and brimstone brigade so I just wait patiently for a sinner to come along to make a lucky juxtaposition.Chris said his work as a paramedic at Peterborough City Hospital helped with his street photography as he was able to reassure complete strangers and react instinctively to the unexpected.Sometimes Chris would talk to the subjects of his photos and discover an even more exciting story - the front cover of his book is one of his favourites.He explained: The lady was about  and lived in Peterborough and was describing how as a young girl on Bonfire Night she set off a rocket and it went through the window of a policemans house and burnt it down.Although it looks like she is giving the finger, she is actually putting her finger up to demonstrate the rocket going in the air."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445610707.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum in tears after universal credit blunder leaves her with 74p to live on for a week","story":"Melissa Whitchurch, , and her partner Chris Steer,  desperately rummaged around their home looking for things to sell so that they could buy food for their five-year-old daughter Cheyenne - because of a late payment of their benefits.The couple, from Brighton, were expecting a Universal Credit payment of £ to be paid into their bank account last week and planned their finances around it.But when Melissa went to take out the money, she was horried to see her balance was just  pence and called the Department for Work and Pensionshotline for help.Melissa claimed the officer said the payment was not due for another six days and, when she tried to explain the mistake, told her it was her problem and hung up.Melissa said: All that was going through my mind was how am I going to feed my daughter and send her to school without her snacks She went on: It breaks my heart to think of her feeling like the odd one out, sat there watching everybody  eat their fruit when she doesnt have any.Melissa, who is signed off work due to mobility problems, had originally asked the DWP to change her payment schedule from a monthly arrangement to a fortnightly one.The family received a payment of £ and were told the other half of that would appear two weeks later.They used the cash to pay off bills and get them food to last the next few weeks, but the other half didnt arrive.Shes just one of many Brits who have had problems with the new benefits system, Universal Credit, which rolls six payments into one.Yesterday the Chancellor revealed that Brits will be able to get more help moving onto Universal Credit - but those changes won’t come in until .Former shop assistant Melissa, who has to take  tablets a day for her health, said: Me and my partner can go without, but not our little girl.If we were told this in the first place, we would have budgeted for it.Its horrible. Cheyenne is really sweet about it and she doesnt really understand, thank goodness.We try to keep her away from it.But when she sees Im upset, she will come over and cuddle me and say its okay mummy. Its horrible and the people that are supposed to help just dont care.They are heartless.And she avoided going to the food bank for help because she was expecting to be paid on time.Kind strangers and neighbours have been helping her out with food in the meantime.Partner Chris was also signed off work as a chef for mental health reasons.A DWP spokesperson said: The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money.

The little extras headteachers need include not having to close their schools early, not having to cancel music and swimming lessons, not having to lay off teaching assistants and not having to beg parents for items such as toilet paper and stationery. Hammond’s choice of words pointed to a deeper problem. It implied that teachers and parents should be grateful for his largesse. But when you have put someone in hospital, you should not be surprisedthe patient then takes umbrageyou come round with a bunch of grapes and words of comfort. The Resolution Foundation think tank delivered its verdict on the Budget this morning and found it was deeply regressive. The Tories like to spin the raising of the income tax threshold as evidence of how they are helping the just about managing but it is a tax cut which is skewed towards the better off and does nothing for the five million people who earn too little to pay the tax.According to the Resolution Foundation, % of the income tax cuts announced yesterday will go to the top half of earners. The richest tenth of households are set to gain  times as much in cash terms next year from the income tax and benefits giveaways in the Budget as the poorest tenth of households . The small print tells a dferent narrative to that presented by the Chancellor. Once you strip away the increase in NHS spending then there is almost nothing for other departments. Even the extra pound.billion for the universal credit is offset by the poundbillion of welfare cuts being imposed by the Tories. Hammond framed his Budget as an example of how the Conservatives were balancing the ending of austerity with continued fiscal discipline. This was a sleight of hand when the figures show the strictures will remain in place for several years to come. The giveaways masked a bigger issue: the Chancellor has limited room to manoeuvre until Brexit is resolved. Everything is predicated upon Theresa May securing a deal."},{"url":null,"title":"philip hammond snaps tv clash","story":"NewsPhilip Hammond SNAPS in TV clash with Susanna Reid over utterly insulting schools cash in the BudgetThe Tory claimed his fund - worth just £k per primary or £k per secondary - was supposed to be a \"nice gesture\" as he faced furyShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video philip-hammond-angry-budget-clash-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailChancellor Philip Hammond squirmed on live TV today as he was blasted over his utterly insulting promise of poundm for schools. The Tory claimed his fund - worth poundk per primary or poundk per secondary this year - would help buy the little extras teachers need. But it comes after years of cuts and pleas by head teachers for supplies as basic as pens and paper. Today the Chancellor told ITVs Good Morning Britain “I just thought that would be a nice gesture” so schools could buy a whiteboard, buy a couple of computers. He insisted schools could get more funds in next years spending review and it’s nothing to do with mainstream schools funding - it was simply a little extra.  But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said people were really angered by the remark. And GMB host Susanna Reid told him: What is happening in schools where theyre considering shorter weeks. They cant buy essentials! The Chancellor snapped: Frankly I reject that. Frankly I reject that. Schools funding will be dealt with in the spending review.  We put pound.bn additional money into schools funding last year to protect per pupil spending. What I did yesterday was nothing to do with that process - i was simply giving back a little bit of the money weve saved this year so schools can buy the odd little piece of kit that they need. I think thats a nice gesture. Many of the schools I know would be very happy to have pound, or even pound, to buy a whiteboard, buy a couple of computers, whatever it is. The money, announced in yesterdays Budget speech, has been allocated as capital spending. Capital funds are ringfenced for building maintenance and purchasing equipment.  That means schools will be allowed to buy iPads with the extra cash, but not pens and paper. And its been noted the money hes set aside for schools is tens of millions less than has been allocated to fix potholes. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that while the announcement was welcome, schools needed more. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner added: It is utterly insulting to parents and teachers for the Chancellor to talk about little extra. School budgets have been cut by billions and head-teachers are begging parents for money for basic supplies like books and stationery.

Michael Tomlinson warned marriage appears to be disappearing in Government policy-making just as much as its disappearing in our poorest communities, as he contributed to the Budget debate in the Commons. He insisted more money should be spent on preventing family breakdown, saying that in turn it would mean lower amounts are spent on dealing with the consequences. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tomlinson said: Im very grateful to the work of the Centre for Social Justice and the work they do in this area because its from the CSJ that I learnt that despite the increased poverty risks, its estimated that the Treasury spends about pound in preventative spending for every pound, responding to the consequences of family breakdown. Further, itd appear that marriage is disappearing in policy-making - just as much as its disappearing in our poorest communities.  Because % of high-earners marry, % of low-earners marry - the rich get married and stay together, the poor dont. Why does this matter  Because where there is poverty, family breakdown is often not far behind - and while poverty is often a driver of family breakdown, crucially so too is family breakdown a driver of poverty. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, children who experience family breakdown are twice as likely to fall into poverty.Listen to our Ayes to the Left Podcast: Budget treat or trickery  And despite the chuntering from the benches opposite, the public really do get this - recent CSJ polling confirmed that young people aged  to  aspire to a lasting a relationship, just as much and they find that just as important as they aspire to a long-term career. Its clear support to the family is important for social mobility and its also important for alleviating poverty. Marriage and the family should not be disappearing from Government policy-making. When it comes to the Budget and our public services, it seems to me that more can be spent on prevention and this would mean less is spent on the consequences of family breakdown.

She had been given special permission by her teacher to be absent and she has to write a journal for her class. And it is going to be quite a story. Clara Levacy had travelled with her family to honour her great-great-grandfather, who is one of the most decorated men in British military history. A hundred years ago on Tuesday, October , Harry Greenwood was fighting in the Battle of the Selle, in France, and was awarded the Victoria Cross for a series of acts of gallantry that many people have said mark him out as a “lunatic”.  Lieutenant Colonel Greenwood was leading the th Battalion of the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry on October ,  in a fierce battle against a battered but determined German army. Many of his men had been killed by a machine gun. Harry got up and, with bullets flying all around him, ran towards the gun post and killed the crew with grenades. Later that day, he again rushed a gun in the same way before leading his men to capture  prisoners and eight machine guns. The following morning he again ran towards Germans firing a machine gun. As the citation for his Victoria Cross put it: “He showed the greatest gallantry ... in the face of heavy fire. His valour was beyond all praise.” Harry is my great-great-uncle and I’ve read a letter in which he says he enjoyed “killing Bosche”. That’s a frightening and incomprehensible thing to read about someone who shares a signicant amount of your DNA. But now that I have read about how he handled himself in the trenches and how he fought so bravely to protect the men with him, I am shyincredibly proud.  Prior to being awarded the VC he had got the MCfor gallantry in  and in July  a DSOfor bravery under fire. In December,  it was announced he was also being awarded a “Bar” to add to his DSO for an occasion when he had fought off two enemy attacks – even after he had been blown up by a shell. As a Lt Col, Harry was one of the most senior ranks in the field – he did not have to stick his head above the trenches or run in front of his men. He could send “boys”, cannon fodder, to do the risky stuff. But not Harry. He ran with his men and ran from the front, and fought with them to protect them as best he could. He had been at war for four years, blown up by shells including friendly fire, been gassed and watched hundreds of his friends killed.  Shortly after the announcement of his VC, Harry wrote: “I did nothing really, save drive on, kill a few huns and cheer our own fellows on a bit when they flagged.” Harry’s brother, David, explained to family that Harry “lacked imagination” – while most people in combat worried about what would happen to themthey ran in front of firing machine guns, Harry was somehow able to block that out of his mind.  He was given his medal by King George V at Buckingham Palace in  and the Daily Mirror published his picture with that of four others awarded the VC that day. The following year he was part of the guard of honour when the Unknown Warrior was laid to rest at Westminster Abbey. In , Harry’s family donated his medals to the Regimental Museum of the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry in Doncaster. In , the Government announced that every VC winner from the First World War born in the UK would be honoured with a paving stone laid in the town of their birth. So that is why I was joined last week by my rd cousin Clara Levacy and  other relatives from the extended Greenwood family in Windsor to mark the shycentenary of Harry’s actions.  If anyone there was in doubt of the signicance of Harry’s achievements, Colonel Dan Reeve of The Rlesspoke to say: “Hiswas an exceptional le that showed a pattern of selfless behaviour in which he routinely placed the interests of others before that of his own.  “He understood that a successful le was not one that pursued self-gratication, but rather one that sought to serve others and build society.” As we watched that paving stone being unveiled by a representative of The Queen and listened as a bugler from The Rles Regiment played Last Post, I read out the names of the  men from Harry’s battalion who died in the two days for which he was awarded the VC.  Among them was the name Harry Greenwood – when I first read it I thought it was a mistake but then I checked. By sad coincidence, on the day one Harry Greenwood got the VC, another Harry Greenwood from the same battalion was killed in action. Private Harry Greenwood was the son of a musician from Wombwell, nearly Barnsley – and he was just . We remembered him as we remembered our Harry.

The disorder occurs when the streptococcus group of bacteria, a common cause of sore or ‘strep’ throat, flares up, triggering an immune response which inflames part of the brain called the basal ganglia. This affects a persons control of their behaviour and emotions. But the strange behavioural changes the disorder causes in a child can often be mistaken for mental health issues, meaning many children go years without getting a proper diagnosis. Evie Prior was four when she was diagnosed with Pandas, leading to fiery temper tantrums, extreme separation anxiety and even saw her wetting herself up to three times a day.  Tragically, Evie suffered for four years before receiving a diagnosis, reports Mail Online. Evies mum Helen said: Overnight, Evie became a dferent child. She also started to develop bizarre sensory issues, including not being able to find the perfect feeling sicks every morning. Helen added: We’d go through six or seven pairs every morning because she could never find any that felt right. Over time, Evie also began obsessing with using the toilet. Her mum added: Suddenly I had a six-year-old who was obsessed with going to the toilet. It had to be the very last thing she did before she left the house. Helen, , said le soon revolved around her daughters obsessive trips to the loo, where she would spend half an hour at a time, crying and distressed because she was convinced she hadn’t finished.  She just couldn’t get off. She became terried of going anywhere, says Helen. Evie was eventually put on a course of antibiotics, with a GP suspecting she was suffering from a urinary tract infection. When Evies behaviour ed to normal, the family were relieved to have their little girl back - before the odd behaviour started once again when her antibiotics ended. With Evie often complaining of a sore throat, mum Helen began researching online and found a blog written by an American mother whose child had been diagnosed with Pandas. After years of fighting for the diagnosis, Evie, now , was eventually diagnosed  months ago by a US specialist her mother consulted via Skype. She has now been on antibiotics continuously for the past year and has had two courses of high-dose steroids.  Georgia Tuckey, an NHS nurse who co-founded the charity Pans Pandas UK earlier this year, also experienced something similar when her -year-old son fell ill in . She resorted to travelling to the America in  for treatment - having to sell the family home to pay for it. Georgia told Good Health: I understand the challenges parents face. I’m a nurse, but I still couldn’t get anyone to believe me. It’s a huge struggle because to many doctors the symptoms look like other conditions for which there are already treatment guidelines.

The royals are traditionally not so hands on when they meet members of the public - but Kate looks to have taken a tip from her more touchy-feely sister-in-law Meghans book and is getting more hands on.  Todays scenes come after Kate ed to royal duties following maternity earlier this month - when she was also seen hugging children during a visit to Paddington Recreation Ground in west London.

But more than this theres one thing thats really captured the attention of royal fans -the fact that no matter where she is, the Duchess simply cant stop touching and cradling her stomach. We think its totally adorable, but we cant help wondering why shes doing it  Thankfully a midwe has shared the answer. Lesley Gilchrist co-founder of My Expert Midwe explained to MailOnline that its a perfectly natural impulse no matter the size of the bump, to instinctively protect her unborn baby.  She revealed that an expectant mother may touch their bump anytime as they navigate the changes in the body and experience new sensations. Although most women will start to feel their baby move by around - weeks, some women may feel this sooner, says Lesley. Flutterings are the first sensations that are felt. However gas movement through the gut feels similar and this may cause an instinctive, involuntary touching of the stomach. It’s not uncommon for women at a similar stage to the Duchess of Sussex to feel those sensations.  She added: Those feelings of your baby moving are extremely special for women. It is such an amazing time. However not everyone is aware of this, and many people on social media have branded Meghans actions staged. One Twitter user wrote: Im not sureits a natural thing to do when pregnant or whether its a little bit staged. Another commented: Sick of the sight of Meghan Sparkle touching that non existent baby bump in every picture! #Embarrassing  A third added: All of a sudden Meghan has started locking her hands right on her tummy. Yeah, the world knows youre pregnant. Dont over-do it. But others were quick to come to her defense. I think it’s sad that people are questioning Meghan’s sincerity surrounding her bump. I once had a baby growing inside me, I can remember feeling a protection of it regardless of it only being a bean. I lost that baby.

While attending a charity reception at Aucklands War Memorial Museum, the -year-old expectant mum opted to recycle an outfit that has a very special story behind it. Meghan first wore the Antonio Berardi dress to cheer Prince Harry on at the Audi Polo Challenge at Coworth Park back in May .

When people think of a procedure that will essentially change the shape of the face and jaw, assumptions of painful jaw breaking surgeries may come to mind.But this jawline enhancer is a non-invasive, quick and relatively pain-free option.  After a consultation, the treatment consisted of intricately mapping out the face and measuring proportions, followed by ious injections of filler that mimics bone to the cheeks, chin and jaw. Dr Zoya said: A wide chin and jaw, are physical calling cards of a healthy male, as these exaggerated features arise from very high levels of testosterone. As testosterone is an immune suppressant, it would take a very healthy inidual for their body to deal with such a suppressant on their immunity. We know that our female ancestors were attracted to these traits in a male as it would give them the best chance of having a healthy offspring.  The husband and we medical team explained that over the years the taboo surrounding male cosmetic procedures has lessened and men have become more confident when it comes to non-invasive surgery. As Jack lay on the bed a combination of Teoxane Ultra Deep, a thick filler that mimics bone, and Teoxane RHA , made of hyaluronic acid and designed to move with facial expression, were injected into his face. One of the tools used to create the sharp angle was a microcannula device, a blunt-ended tube that may make the squeamish feel a little faint - but according to Jack it was fairly painless. The theory that we are closer to our ancestors than we think when it comes to dating is backed by Dr Nikhil Chaudhary, leading evolutionary anthropologist at Cambridge University.  He explains that women typically find attractive traits that our ancestors would have also found inticing. He said: Think of it this way - in the animal kingdom, species such as peacocks are more attractive to the female when their tails are more intricate in design and colour as it reflects they have good health. This basic theory is evident in females throughout the animal kingdom, including humans. It would make evolutionary sense that women today would still be attractive to men who display these traits of health.  As Jack was handed the mirror, I have never seen such an instant reaction - he was incredibly pleased with the results, to the point where he wouldnt stop looking in the mirror. He really did look more hunky, before he had slightly softer features, boy-like almost, but after his treatment he looked sharper. His results will last around a year and can be reversed should he decide to go back to his original look. It may be quick - Jack had his new jaw in under half an hour - but its not cheap, especially for those who are looking for a dramatic change. The Superhero Jaw can be achieved from pound to pound.

In a panic, Melissa Whitchurch, , called the Department for Work and Pensions hotline but claim she was that it was her problem. Melissa and her partner Chris Steer were expecting a Universal Credit payment of pound to be paid into their bank account at midnight last Thursday and had budgeted accordingly. However, to the mum-of-ones horror, when she went to draw out the money, her balance was just  pence. Melissa claimed the officer said the payment was not due for another six days and, when she tried to explain the mistake, told her it was her problem and hung up.  The couple resorted to scouring their home to find things they could potentially sell so they could afford to feed their three-year-old daughter, Cheyanne. Melissa, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: All that was going through my mind was how am I going to feed my daughter and send her to school without her snacks  The children all put healthy food in a box at school in the morning, such as fruit and crackers, and then they sit down and eat it together during story time. It breaks my heart to think of her feeling like the odd one out, sat there watching everybody  eat their fruit when she doesnt have any. Melissa had originally asked the DWP to change her payment schedule from a monthly arrangement to a fortnightly one.  When the family received their last payment of pound, they were told the other half would arrive two weeks later and used the money to pay bills and buy food to last a fortnight. But when the second half did not arrive, Melissa was told it would be made on the last day of the month and was forced to wait six days with only  pence to her name. She said: Me and my partner can go without, but not our little girl. If we were told this in the first place, we would have budgeted for it. Its horrible. Cheyenne is really sweet about it and she doesnt really understand, thank goodness. We try to keep her away from it. But when she sees Im upset, she will come over and cuddle me and say its okay mummy. Its horrible and the people that are supposed to help just dont care. They are heartless.  The family have been surviving on food donations from strangers and neighbours who heard about their desperate situation. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  Melissa said: I could have gone to the food bank last week but since I thought I would be paid the next day, I didnt and the next one isnt for another week. So weve been getting by thanks to the kindness of other people. One lady heard about my situation and came and gave us some bread, milk, ham and cheese and Id never even seen or spoken to her before.  Melissa said she would love nothing more than toto work since she was signed off due to problems with her health  years ago. But the former shop assistant has limited mobility and has aids to help her around the house due to her back pain and other health issues, for which she takes more than  tablets per day.  Chris was also signed off from his job as a chef just five months ago for mental health reasons. Universal Credit is a new benefits system, introduced to simply and replace many existing benefits and tax credits and consists of a single, monthly benefit payment into a bank account. A DWP spokesperson said: “The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money. Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help. “Universal Creditreplaces an out-of-date, complex benefits system with clf edges that disincentivised work and often trapped people in unemployment. Under UC, evidence shows people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer.The Mirror is urging our readers to back our petition to stop the rollout Universal Credit which is plunging families into debt and despair and replace it with a fair system."},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry offers student job","story":"NewsPrince Harry offers student a job on the spot as they have a cuppa together - and shes already celebratingPrince Harry and Meghan Markle visited a community cafe in Wellington, New Zealand, on their Royal Tour when they met Lucia KennedyShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video harry-meghan-visit-maranui-cafe-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLanding your dream job can be extremely challenging, and many people work for years before they eventually reach their goal.

Now all she needs to do now is finish her double degree in commerce and psychology, majoring in marketing and information... Lucia was obviously very excited about the exciting offer, and was planning to go out for dinner with her flatmates last night to celebrate.  Harry and his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate have campaigned to get rid of the negative stigma associated with mental health through the charity Heads Together.

Amy Howell Pundt couldnt believe it when the sickening message was found under the familys front door in Kokomo, Indiana, US, aimed at her -year-old bi-racial son. The twisted note read: THIS IS A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD - some people find N*****S Stressful... We moved to a WHITE TOWN, ALL WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD - FOR HEALTH REASONS AMONG OTHER THINGS. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THE NEIGHBORS BEFORE BRINGING A N****R KID INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

Writing about the ordeal online, she said: The toilet paper, that was a warning. The note, that was a threat. An entire typed out letter about my son who had been watched and plotted against. My bi-racial son. My child was facing bigotry and hatred at a level I cant even fathom. Just for the colour of his skin! This is a small town where everyone knows everyone. I’m not so naive to think that racism doesn’t happen here, I’m sure it does, we’ve even discussed it and how to handle it and what to do. It’s just never happened to him or us before.

One mum-to-be has been attempting to maintain her fitness levels after finding out shes going to have a child, but it seems not everyone thinks she should be doing this. Natalie Hillar from Sydney, Australia, claims she was recently forced to leave a gym class by an instructor who shamed her for being pregnant.  The communications consultant who is six months pregnant said she felt humiliated by this incidnet. According to the mother-of-two, last Wednesday she attended her regular Bodycombat session at a local Fitness First gym. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the -year-old said: I went to the class as ususal. I took a position at the back of the room and the instructor read out the disclaimer which they do in every class. She warnedanyone has any pregnancies or injuries to make sure they have a medical clearance, which I confidently have.  Natalie goes on to explain how the class starts and she follows the moves at a comfortable pace, avoiding jumping around. Then suddenly the instructor shuts off the music and reportedly says: I dont knowanyone heard me at the beginning of the class but I dont teach this class to pregnant people. Unsureshed heard her properly, Natalie continued exercising. But the music soon stopped once again.  She claims the instructor repeated her earlier words: She stopped the music again and said I can still see pregnant people in this class, I refuse to teach pregnant people. At that point I realised I needed to leave, recalls Natalie.As I was walking out, I glared at her. Then she grabbed the microphone and shouted I know youre upset, but its for your own good, love. She added: I felt really humiliated. What confuses me most is Ive been to the same class for my previous pregnancies and I never had any problems.  A spokesman for Fitness First explained that the safety of members is their number one priority. They added: We understand the level of exercise during pregnancy is personal and usually determined by pre-pregnancy fitness levels and advice from general practitioners. In addition to advice from their GP, we recommend any pregnant members noty the group fitness instructor prior to participating in a class. All of our group exercise instructors are required to make members aware of any risks and recommend against exercises should they be unsafe. In this case, this was the professional recommendation given. The class BODYCOMBAT is not recommended during pregnancy because of the joint instability. They added that their team are currently in touch with Ms Hillar.

The fans were right with us until the last minute.“It does help, it makes a massive dference and Dunfermline isn’t too far down the road so I’d expect another good away following.“I think the fans can see the work and effort we’re putting in, evenwe didn’t get the three points last Saturday.“The fans have been great and long may it continue.”Allan Johnston’s Pars have been struggling of late after a lightning fast start to the season saw them follow up four wins from four in the Betfred Cup group stage with an impressive - victory at Tannadice.Since then, Dunfermline have only managed eight points from the following eight games and were beaten - at home last weekend despite dominating against Queen of the South.In fact, scoring goals at home has been a real problem of late with just the two Championship strikes going in.Booth  Co., however, are wary of a repeat show from the Pars.He said: “Dunfermline were really good at Tannadice the first time we played them and thoroughly deserved to win.“I think most people would be surprised they’ve not kicked on from that first game.“They played well that day and deserved the win.“I’ve not seen much of them since but it’s not worked out for them since for whatever reason.“They’ll still be a dangerous opponent, though, because they are, obviously, capable of putting in a performance but have just been a bit inconsistent recently.“If we go about it like we have done in the last two games then we’ll give ourselves a chance.“We’ll be going there in positive spirits, try to take our chances and come back up the road with the three points.”"},{"url":null,"title":"can you give a home to this timid hamster rolly","story":"The Scottish SPCA is seeking new owners for a cute hamster who has found herself at the charity#s Dundee rehoming centre.Rolly, the Russian dwarf hamster, is described as a #lovely little girl# who ended up at the Petterden centre through no fault of her own.Although a gently-natured creature, the hamster would not be suited to a home with kids.An SSPCA spokeswoman said: #She is quite a timid girl and will need an owner who will be able to continue on with daily handling and socialisation to ensure that she becomes a well-mannered part of the family.#Rolly is looking for a home with no young children.#If you can offer Rolly the home she deserves then please contact the rehoming centre on   ."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee appoint jimmy boyle as new assistant manager","story":"Dundee have appointed Jimmy Boyle as assistant manager to Jim McIntyre.The -year-old steps up from his post as head of the Dark Blues youth academy to team up with the new boss who arrived to succeed Neil McCann last week.Jimmy has been in the dugout for the games against Livingston and Hearts and confirmation he’s to remain their permanently brings to an end the Billy Dodds saga that’s dragged on since the new manager arrived last week.Dodds, who was Jim’s number two at Ross County, was his first choice for the same post at Dens Park, but well documented matters relating to his departure after Dundee went into administration in  made him unacceptable to many Dark Blues fans.As well as him, it’s understood Dens legend Barry Smith and Aberdeen coach Barry Robson were also being considered.But Jim has opted for another man he knows well and who has extensive experience in coaching and management.The pair played together at Airdrie and during eight years with the Diamonds, Jimmy appeared in two Scottish Cup finals.After a career that included spells at a string of clubs including Queen’s Park, Livingston and Partick Thistle, he was Airdrie’s under- coach for several seasons before succeeding Kenny Black as manager in .He was sacked three years later, but was quickly appointed to the SFA’s coaching staff and in  was headhunted by Dundee to take charge of developing their emerging talent.Over the last two-and-half-years he’s transformed the fortunes of the club’s underage sides and last season saw him steer the Development squad to a second place finish in their league.Known for someone who prefers to stay out of the limelight, he has been persuaded to make the step back up to first team level and assist his old team-mate in keeping Dundee in the Premiership.A Dundee FC statement said: #Jimmy has been with the club since joining as head of youth development in .

That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

services.However, the report adds the council’s financial performance has so far been a “positive one” with spending “largely in line” with budget for this stage of the year.The council is facing a small overspend of £.m.Councillor Douglas Lumsden, convener of the city growth and finance committee, said: “The quarter two financial performance report highlights the performance to date is a positive one with net expenditure largely in line with budget for this stage of the year.“As the lowest-funded council in Scotland, it is getting harder and harder each year to balance our books.”A total of  posts will go through job transfers and not recruiting for vacant roles, as well as offering voluntary redundancies and early retirement.At the end of the second quarter, the council has achieved savings of £.m of an £.m target, with £.m made by cutting  posts.The report said a “signicant proportion” of the posts reduction savings have been achieved through voluntary severance and early retirement, with the costs associated with the scheme continuing to be a “pressure” against the council’s balance sheet.It added a continuation of posts reduction through this means was “unsustainable”.The council will now need to look at “other means” of managing the workforce including the upskilling of the roles of existing staff.Tommy Campbell, Unite regional officer, said: “The

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain.

In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op. And the busy dad-of-three apparently had no idea that the arrival of the President of the United States was imminent. By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags.

about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been

InChorus.The choir has been celebrating its tenth birthday this autumn and members have just ed from an exciting long weekend of performances and appearances in the Catalonian city.The choirrsquos programme of main events began in the wonderful Palau De La Musica Catalana - a UNESCO World Heritage Site of extraordinary beauty, the modernistic design and decoration of which is quite unique.After a tour of the building, choir members were askedthey would like to sing on the main stage.Choir manager, Lorna Turnbull told us: ldquoThe design of the Palau is mind blowing and the acoustics are amazing.\"We were told that we could sing just one song, but having heard us, we were asked to sing another.\"This happened on the first morning of the trip, and I was afraid that everything  we had planned for the weekend would be an anti-climax. I neednrsquot have worried. Barcelona did us proud.The next major event took place in the beautul old church of Sant Gaieta in the Eixample District of the city, where the priest raises money for an African mission by staging regular quality concerts.A large, very discerning, audience took the choir to its heart, with many of them coming backstage to express their thanks.The following day InChorus travelled to Sabadell, north of Barcelona, where they were introduced to Coral Catasons, a contemporary choir of similar size.The choirs performed a joint concert to a full house, receiving a standing ovation, with some excellent hospitality from the Spanish choir and some hilarious Catalonian entertainment for afters.Friendships were formed on the back of which Coral Catasons has announced its intention to visit Peebles and the wider Scottish Borders next June.The final scheduled event was an hour-long performance on the steps of the magnicent Barcelona Cathedral.Lorna added: \"To stand in such a location singing in the sunshine to a fantastic audience was extraordinary. The choir loved it.\"On the plane to Catalonia - at the suggestion of the pilot - and at other points throughout the trip, the choir took the opportunity to sing whenever and wherever they could, especially in the beautul squares and open spaces of the Gothic Quarter around La Rambla.As the days progressed, whether singing or sight seeing, members were recognised increasingly.Men in kilts are an instant attraction, and this, combined with the gentsrsquo Catalonian coloured bright teeshirts bearing a line in Spanish from lsquoHavanarsquo, a piece from the choirrsquos repertoire, ensured a positive response everywhere.In the course of the few days they were congratulated and spoken to by people from all around the world including South America, the United States, Canada, all over Europe, Russia, India, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia.To cap this there was the warm welcome extended to the choir by the Spanish people.Accompanying the choir through all its derring-do was the InChorus mascot, Singu, a penguin given to the choir by the family of the late Celia Hayton, a much loved choir member.Musical Director, Aly Skidmore, added: ldquoInChorus decided over a year ago that Barcelona would be the perfect city in which to properly celebrate its first decade.\"The culture there embraces all the arts, but music particularly. The choir worked hard to master an extensive repertoire of both sacred and secular pieces which could be performed in any venue or outdoor space.\"The response from our audiences reflected appreciation of the achievement of this choir from the Scottish Borders."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-praise-galashiels-tot-bens-fundraising-efforts","story":"MPs have praised the fundraising efforts of

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community. We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday.

Will they help stimulate investment, productivity and employment  Will they favour particular sectors or income groups across the UK Second, we need to work through the implications for public spending in Scotland. Which changes will affect Scotland directly and which will work their way through the system via the block grant Third, we must consider implications for those tax powers, in particular income tax, which are largely devolved. At the least there can be effects on the base line from which adjustments for Scotland can be developed.As ever these days the new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibilitywere critical - as will be the case in Decemberrsquos Scottish Budget with the independent forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission .There was little change in the GDP growth forecast ndash tiny increases for next year and the year after but from then on as we were. The key point to emphasise is that UK growth is set to remain muted, .% per annum maximum rather than the % or .% we should be seeking.But the good news from the OBR was that they expect stronger employment and sustained growth in real wages in each of the next five years. After such an extended period of decline in real wages this,achieved, will be really positive for households across Scotland.In advance of the Budget there were estimates that, thanks to strong tax revenues, the fiscal deficit for   was likely to come in some billions of pounds below prior expectations ndash giving scope for expenditure increases. The stronger than expected performance in tax revenue is now expected to continue. However, Mr Hammond appears to have flexed up and to be prepared to live with a deficit each year of around pound billion, close on % of GDP. Nevertheless the level of UK debt will fall below forecast. He claims he will meet his fiscal rules while at the same time he also claiming that lsquothe era of austerity is finally coming to an endrsquo.Most of the public expenditure changes announced do not relate to Scotland directly, but will feed through via upward adjustments in the block grant. The Chancellor tells us that the feed through will mean an uplt for Scotland of pound million in   and lsquomuch largerrsquo increases in years to come.That will be good news for Derek Mackay and team. But they must make their own judgements on how to allocate these funds ndash taking note perhaps of what is proposed in England but following their own priorities.The changes in income tax allowances announced in the Budget will cause pause for thought. The increases in personal rate allowance and the higher rate threshold have been brought forward to April .Increasing dferentials between Scottish income tax rates and those in the rest of the UK would have fiscal and ndash potentially ndash economic incentive implications.Mr Hammond did stress his desire to unleash business investment and announced measures which he hopes will stimulate activity, and which will apply in Scotland. There is an increase in the annual business investment allowance more support for UK exporters and more funds for the British Business Bank. Not massive but helpful.We must now await whatever emerges in the Scottish Budget on th December. But, as Mr Hammond himself has made clear, a lsquono deal Brexitrsquo would mean that all Budget bets are off.

Itrsquos possible he kept this collection as a research tool.ldquoThese are images we really should treasure.Dr Marshall was born in Leith in , and became minister of Kirkgate Church in . He was regarded as an authority on the area, and went on to complete a doctorate on the portrsquos history.He later moved to St Andrews, and died in , aged .Yet even he might struggle to recognise some elements of the ancient port today, which have seen it propelled from one of Edinburghrsquos lower cost areas to one of its most desirable.Indeed, itrsquos so dferent, that some have argued its regeneration has gone too far, with claims that the once gritty area known for its sense of community and unique role on the fringe of the capital has become lsquogentriedrsquo, its historic assets stripped by property developers and leisure groups.Recent debate in the port has raged over suggestions that local people are being lsquopushed outrsquo of the area by rising prices and new developments.Last year a Scottish Government-backed study of the area raised concerns over rising property prices and the impact on local people whose families had lived in Leith for generations, attempting to remain.The study findings, along with a controversial poundm plan for hotel, student accommodation and leisure facilities on Leith Walk, sparked a Save Leith Walk campaign which has attracted backing from writer Irvine Welsh, The Proclaimers and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Campaigners last month presented a , signature to Edinburgh City Council claiming development of the area will damage local business and unravel the arearsquos heritage and community.Meanwhile, there are even plans for a National Lottery-funded play, provisionally entitled Displaced, which is expected to explore the impact of development on the area. It is due to be staged next summer, to coincide with theof tramworks to the area.The online exhibition includes several photographs of Leithrsquos old tram network as well as steam engines waiting for passengers at Leith Central Station, which closed in .Councillor Ian Perry, Councillor Ian Perry, Education, Children and Families Convener, said: ldquoThis is a most interesting collection of images from Leithrsquos rich and ied past, dating as far back as the th century, and sheds light on so many aspects of the arearsquos social history."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-women-on-banknotes-have-the-power-to-improve-society","story":"The bank is painfully aware of this, of course, to the extent that it has even floated the idea of ditching the RBS moniker in favour of something less ldquotarnished. While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBSrsquos ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its pound polymer note in , the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the pound version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue pound note.After nearly  years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just  years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.For too long the notes printed and distributed by banks have given the impression that that world is one where only men matter, or at least where only menrsquos achievements are worth taking note of. As journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez said when challenging the Bank of Englandrsquos  decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on its pound notes: ldquoAn all-male line-up on our banknotes sends out the damaging message that no woman has done anything important enough to appear.Our towns and cities are full of images and symbols of what countless men have achieved, with the naming of streets and chiselling of statues conferring Men of History status on them in the process. Women have not been afforded this luxury and, with some exceptions that remain woefully few and far between, their many achievements have gone unnoticed. This was highlighted by Willow Tea Room Trust chair Celia Sinclair when she said at the launch of the new RBS pound note that while Kate Cranston was an ldquoexcellent businesswoman who changed attitudes, in her day she really wasnrsquot all that unusual. ldquoThere were many women like Kate Cranston around at that time, but history simply doesnrsquot remember them, Ms Sinclair noted.That society has been able to forget those and countless other women is damaging because while it risks giving women the impression that they have nothing to live up to, it also perpetuates the myth still believed by some men that they simply havenrsquot achieved anything worth commemorating in the first place. All little girls need positive role models to give them the belief that they can grow up to be whatever they want to be, but it is just as important for equality that little boys know that women fulfil important roles too. I hadnrsquot realised quite how important until the day my then three-year-old son, who up until that point had only ever been seen by a female GP, couldnrsquot get his head round the fact the doctor we were off to see was going to be a man. Seeing is believing, though, and after that visit he took me at my word when I said that, just like women, men too can be anything they want to be.Which is why it is so important that Nan Shepherd, Mary Somerville and Kate Cranston, whose histories show what women can achieve in the arts, science and business worlds, have not just been commemorated but have been commemorated in a way that ensures all of us will come into contact with their images again and again and again. As RBSrsquos Scottish chair Malcolm Buchanan said when he unveiled the Kate Cranston pound last week, the bank feels that ldquoa banknotersquos value is more than just the figure printed across its front - it is our symbol, which lives in peoplersquos pockets and touches everyday lives.A statue in a part of a town that a fraction of us will visit or a portrait on a wall that only some of us will pass by is one thing, but an image on a note that will fall out of birthday cards and get passed from person to person as we go about our daily lives has the potential to have a far greater impact on our collective consciousness.RBSrsquos inclusion of women on its notes may have come at a time when banks in general are making plans for a cashless society, but there are still tens of millions of them in circulation and it is no exaggeration to say that in an incremental way the move will help to make society better for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-insists-chancellors-give-away-budget-not-precursor-to-snap-general-election","story":"The Chancellor used Mondays statement to announce a pound billion loosening of the purse-strings with income tax breaks for  million voters, help with business rates for the High Street, support for Universal Credit and the promise of increased public spending over the coming years.The package prompted speculation that the Conservative Government was preparing the way for a snap poll to provide the Prime Minister with a solid Commons majority as Brexit comes into effect in the spring.Asked at a press conference in Oslo ndash where she is attending the Northern Future Forum - whether or not she was planning to ask voters to go back to the polls, Mrs May responded emphatically: \"No. We are not preparing for another general election. That would not be in the national interest.\"The forum is being attended by a number of north European states and will be followed by a meeting of the Nordic Council, which the PM will address.Mr Hammond also insisted that his Budget tax cuts and spending hikes were not intended to woo voters ahead of an early poll.Askedthe giveaway Budget was a marker for a possible general election, Mr Hammond told ITVs Good Morning Britain: \"I hope not. What we are preparing for is Britains future. Weve now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news.\"The Chancellor suggested that a good Brexit deal could trigger more tax cuts and increased public service spending.\"Because there will be a benefit to the economy from getting that deal, I hope we will be able to do a little bit better still than I set out yesterday, with a bit more money for public services when we have our spending review next year, and perhaps a bit more available going forward for some more tax cuts.\"His Labour Shadow John McDonnell claimed the Budget could indeed signal a general election ahead.He told ITVs Good Morning Britain: \"The Tories usually do this. If a general election is coming, what theyll do is theyll splash out some money and thenthey win the election they then start cutting it back again.\"Mr McDonnell dismissed the Chancellors claim austerity was coming to an end as he insisted it was \"rolling out still\".ldquoPeople will be crushingly disappointed at yesterday because it certainly wasnt the end [of austerity],\" he said.The Shadow Chancellor confirmed Labour would support Mr Hammonds tax cuts but make the system fairerthe party won power.Paul Johnson, who heads the highly respected economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the Chancellor had \"got lucky\" because tax revenues were better than expected.He told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"Hes just simply decided to spend all of that. He has abandoned any idea of getting to budget balance by the mid-s.\"Mr Johnson said there were big increases in NHS spending over the coming years but \"he hasnt found any money\" for other public services.Mr Hammond responded by noting how the budget deficit would decline in every year of the forecast period and declared: \"We retain an ambition to balance the budget.\"He dismissed suggestions that he had chopped down the \"magic money tree\" and burnt the lot.The Chancellor told Today: \"You are painting a picture here that is designed to show that Im abandoning fiscal rectitude. Im not.\"He defended his decision to increase income-tax thresholds in a way which benefited the wealthy more than the worse-off.Many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, noted Mr Hammond, adding: \"Its important to raise all of these thresholds.One effect of raising the p higher rate of tax threshold from next year to pound, for middle earners south of the border means the tax dferentials between England and Scotland are growing as the Scottish Government introduces its own rates and bands.Derek Mackay, the Scottish Finance Secretary, is due to give his Budget in December. He argued that his changes earlier this year to the Scottish tax system, including introducing a new p starter rate, made income tax north of the border more progressive.But his Conservative opponents complained that Scotland was already the ldquohighest taxed part of the UK and insisted the case for more SNP tax rises in the Scottish Government forthcoming Budget was unsustainable.Asked about the widening gap on income tax between Scotland and England, the PMrsquos spokeswoman simply referred reporters to the Treasury.Askedthere was any concern that the dfering tax systems across the border were weakening the Union, she pointed to a range of measures in the Budget, which benefited all corners of the UK.The policies announced in Mr Hammonds third economic statement amounted to a poundbn loosening of the purse-strings over a six-year period.But the spectre of a no-deal Brexit hung over the -minute speech with the Office for Budget Responsibility warning that failure to reach agreement with Brussels would hit the economy hard.A disorderly Brexit \"could have severe short-term implications for the economy, the exchange rate, asset prices and the public finances\", warned the Governments independent forecaster. The scale would be very hard to predict, it noted, given the lack of precedent.\"Setting out his income tax cuts, the Chancellor not only mentioned the threshold rise for the higher rate of income tax but also said the personal allowance would rise to pound, from April . The changes had been due to come into force in .Mr Hammond said it would put \"pound in the pocket of a typical basic rate taxpayer\". The Treasury calculated the cumulative effect of increases in tax thresholds since  at pound, for basic rate payers and pound, for those paying the higher rate.The Chancellor set out a five-year plan

Health to pay for a pound.bn boost to NHS spending in England, while other departments see their budgets rise in line with inflation.Downing Street insisted the spending pledges were fully funded,

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector.

We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Tuesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118016.jpg","title":"Marathon trek pays off for charity","story":"A THURSO man has raised more than pound for charity by walking coast-to-coast across Scotland.Douglas Fraser decided to raise awareness of prostate cancer and raise money at the same time.\"As I enjoy walking I decided to do a coast-to-coast walk across Scotland and ask the public to donate money.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmFolk in Orkney are being invited to a special workshop which is being held as part of film director Danny Boyle#s UK-wide Armistice event, Pages of the Sea.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

At the moment I am in touch with an old colleague who has done work like this in the past.\"It would be good to see the bridge reinstated, as it is a worthwhile amenity and opens up the walk around the town giving access to the bird le on the mud flats.\"Every week, the question is asked by somebody, lsquowhen will the bridge be reopenedrsquo and we would love to give them a date but for now all we can do is open a crowdfunding page to seewe can try and make it happen ourselves.\"Similarly, we need to raise funds for a survey on the MacDonald Monument.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

The challenges we face around the changing nature of work, globalisation, inequality and automation create a space for new ideas to grow and to be tested, to open up new opportunities.It’s fair to say that in the years since the referendum the challenges have continued to grow, and indeed have been added to as we head towards the uncertainty of Brexit and its long-term impacts on the country. We’ve seen some change in approach and thinking in response to this – the Scottish Government’s leadership around the concept of basic income being one of the most innovative examples – but it also seems that the new Enlightenment has not quite happened. The desire is there, but the actuality of bringing it to fruition seems to still be waiting to reach a tipping point.: Jamie Cooke: A basic income for all is not deadAt RSA Scotland – the Scottish arm of the global Royal Society for the encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce – we believe that this tipping point is now. We are an organisation founded during the Enlightenment on the very principles of humanism, autonomy and universalism which have such a critical role to play in the challenging world we are in. Work is changing dramatically, and economic insecurity has become one of the defining features of the modern economy. Punitive approaches to social security such as Universal Credit have created hugely negative impacts for citizens, and fail even on their own narrow objectives. International collaboration feels weaker than it has done for many years, as ious governments follow protectionist programmes at the expense of mutual benefit. And the looming catastrophe of climate change is already forcing communities to have to move away from lands disappearing under the waves, or to suffer extreme weather conditions which lead to loss of le and economic collapse.This paints a pessimistic portrait of the world, but we strongly believe that turbulent times can also be the spur for new innovation and progress. Much as the original Enlightenment was a powerful response to the dark times which preceded it, our challenges today require us to create new thinking. A new Scottish Enlightenment would build on those original principles, particularly in its openness to the rest of the world, and would harness the power of technology and communication for the common good. It would utilise new deliberative forms of democratic engagement which can revitalise our politics. It would see us renew our social contract to one of opportunity and security, rooted in policies such as basic income which are humanistic, universal and trust the autonomous decisions of our citizens. It would turn the development of automation and articial intelligence from threats to opportunities, to reconnect us with good work and an appreciation of the iety of ways that people make a dference to society, such as caring and volunteering.: Five Scottish philosophers who helped shape the worldWe were therefore delighted earlier this month to have the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon deliver her keynote speech on Brexit at our historical headquarters in London. What was crucial for us was that the First Minister started her speech by celebrating the Enlightenment principles which are shared by the RSA and the Scottish Government, and called for them to be a renewed focus for policy making. This is not a party political statement – for us at RSA Scotland it is a responsibility for all parties, civic society, academia, business and the wider Scottish public, to rise to the challenges which confront us. It shows that there is an appetite in Scotland for truly embedding Enlightenment thinking into our decision making processes, to broaden out our civic engagement. It’s a big call, but one which could fundamentally change our country.So how do we move from talk to action  It will, at heart, be a collaborative effort – no one group or organisation can claim the principles of the Enlightenment for themselves. At RSA Scotland, with our erse and inspirational Fellowship in Scotland – part of nearly , Fellows across the globe – we are opening up the opportunity to make this a reality for the rest of Scottish society. We want to work with you to help take this forward, to update the thinking for the st century, and to identy how we can tangibly change society by turning ideas into action. We want to convene a gathering on the new Scottish Enlightenment which will be seen as a powerful, society-wide response to the dark times we are in, and a positive statement of the future we want to create. In the Great Room of theRSA House, where the First Minister gave her speech, the walls are covered with the famous series of paintings, Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture by James Barry. Showing the journey of humanity from darkness – and the risk of ing there once again – it offers us an inspiring call to action for the st century. As once before Scotland played a critical role which outweighed our size and location in the world, we believe that once again we can do so, and that out of these challenging times a new Enlightenment can be our response.Jamie Cooke is the head of RSA Scotland.

The wolves achieved this through predating grazing animals, which in turn took pressure off young trees and helped kickstart the recovery of a lost forest. The forest then grew up along rivers that in some cases changed course.But keystone species don’t always have to be apex predators, they can also be ones which physically create habitats in which hundreds of other animals and plants can play out their lives. The humble seaweeds known commonly as kelp are such species. Their keystone role is so important that, last week, Sir David Attenborough spoke out on the need to protect kelp from the industrial-scale harvesting proposed in Scotland’s inshore waters. Sir David was unequivocal in his statement that the dredging proposals are a “wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds”.: Mechanical dredging for kelp would be environmental vandalism, MSPs toldKelp forms underwater ‘forests’ that provide food and shelter for myriad marine le including sea squirts, anemones, molluscs, worms, brittlestars, prawns, soft corals, sponges, amphipods and fish such as lumpsuckers, saithe, pollock and wrasse. They also provide us with an array of benefits by sequestering and storing carbon, providing breeding grounds for commercially important fish and protecting coasts from storm damage. Remove kelp and we remove an entire living ecosystem – hence Sir David’s unusually forthright appeal.The kelp harvesting proposal has been made by the Ayr-based company Marine Biopolymers, who wish to dredge , tonnes of kelp a year along Scotland’s west coast. Harvested kelp is valuable for processing into a carbohydrate called aginate, used in iety of dferent products from salad dressings and ice cream to shampoo, toothpaste, and pharmaceuticals.Consultations on the proposal are ongoing but Green MSP Mark Ruskell successfully amended the Scottish Crown Estate Bill during the second stage of its current passage through parliament with a clause that effectively bans harvesting techniques that prevent plants from re-growing. If this amendment survives stage three of the Bill, it may well render the Marine Biopolymers proposal redundant. Many would celebrate such an outcome, not least those who have businesses that depend on healthy coastal ecosystems, including those who gather kelp using sustainable, hand-harvesting techniques.: Jonny Hughes: We should encourage conservation beyond deer and grouseThe kelp drama illustrates perfectly the new contract we need to negotiate with our natural environmentwe are to have a sustainable, prosperous future. On the one hand, we have a proposal which could plunder a valuable resource, leaving it so damaged that its future value will be lost. This is exactly what happened with Scotland’s herring fishery, which from a peak of  million barrels in  collapsed to nothing by the s. Alternatively we can look after the vital stocks of natural capital within our kelp forests and seek instead to realise the idends these stocks will providemanaged responsibly. Some of that value might be direct financial flows, for example from products manufactured from hand harvesting. Some of that value will be less obvious but even more vital, such as natural coastal defences, carbon storage and protection of breeding grounds from which we derive world-beating, nutritious seafood.The kelp debate is a chance to show we can sht from a model of plunder to a model of stewardship in our marine environment. Let’s make that move.Jonny Hughes is Chief Executive of the Scottish Wildle Trust.

Not because we wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with Nigel Farage # a man we had, and have, nothing in common, politically, industrially, or ideologically, writes Mick Whelan, the union#s general secretary.Instead, it was because we believe the EU has become a rich man’s club which offers plenty for the boss class – but very little for the ordinary hard-working men and women trying to earn a living in this conservative age of austerity.I’ll be frank. We didn’t realise that the Tory government was going to make such a horse’s arse of leaving. I was a district organiser for Aslef before I became general secretary, and I know that our isional organisers and company council reps are much, much better negotiators than the risible lightweights Theresa May has sent to try and do the business in Brussels. And, while I know she was a remain supporter during the referendum campaign, she did famously say “Brexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it”.Now there were cynics who suggested that “Brexit means Brexit” was one of the more fabulously fatuous remarks of our times. But many of us took it to mean that there was no going back, and that May would be able to do a deal that was good for Britain. That, after all, was the promise she made.But it doesn’t look, right now, asshe will be able to do a deal at all. And any deal which she does put before Parliament looks asit will fall far short of what Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, David Davis and the other Brexiteers promised during the referendum campaign just two years ago.: No-deal Brexit an ‘absolute nightmare’ for economyAt the heart of our objections to the EU were a couple of proposals which we knew would be bad for Britain, in general, and bad for the railways, in particular – the European Commission’s Fourth Railway Package and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnershipwith the United States.The Fourth Railway Package is a controversial set of proposals which would foist the British model of rail privatisation on the rest of Europe. We know privatisation does not work. It’s not the right model for Britain and it’s not the right model for Europe. But this package, which despite the reservations of many MEPs, and protests from rail workers across the continent, is the one the neo-liberal ideologues at the heart of the EU are determined to foist on people whether they want it or not. It will turn what we see as a public service into an opportunity for a few firms to plunder a private profit.Because privatisation has not worked, does not work, and will not work in what is a natural monopoly. The model is broken and is selling Britain – passengers, taxpayers, and those of who work on the railway – woefully short. In the last -odd years, since John Major privatised our industry in the s, we have seen our rolling stock get older, our trains get more crowded, and our fares go right through the roof. We now have the highest passenger fares in western Europe. Why  Because of privatisation!: Brian Wilson: May must ditch DUP and its ‘blood red line’ over BrexitTTIP was a free trade and investment treaty being negotiated, in secret, between the EU and the US. It was, and is, unnecessary, as the EU and US already enjoy strong trade and investment relationships, with tarfs at minimal levels. So why are some companies so keen to see this new deal signed  Because the aim was to remove barriers which restrict the profits transnational corporations can make.The problem, of course, is that what global corporations perceive as barriers include vital regulations protecting our labour rights, food safety and banking safeguards. It might be handy for a profit-hungry corporationit didn’t have to comply with pesky social and environmental regulations but it would not be very good for the rest of us. TTIP appeared to wither away – first there were problems in the European Parliament and then Donald Trump seemed to prefer to pursue his aggressive America First policy – but there are signs that this zombie deal has been resurrected behind the scenes.Britain’s public health and education sectors have suffered gradual privatisation and TTIP will only accelerate this transformation of our public services into privately run sectors. For those who want to make a private profit at public expense.As the aim of Brexit is to take back control of our destiny, it would be totally wrong to sell the people out to the EU or the US. We do not want a Brexit deal with the EU which would make it easier for companies to source goods and services from countries, such as the US, where labour standards are lower, or to eradicate workers’ rights, such as collective bargaining and our right to organise, on the grounds that they restrict a company’s business model and its profit margins.Remaining in the single market would make our decision-making process even less democratic here in Britain as we would still be bound by EU directives without having a voice around the table as they are drawn up. Norway, often touted as a possible template for Brexit, incorporates single market rules as they are made in Brussels and Strasbourg. And we should remember that a recent Norwegian government report concluded that, through its single market membership, it is three-quarters integrated into the EU compared to a typical EU member country.And state aid is banned as a distortion of competition under Article . The EU Commission may grant very limited or temporary exceptions but has indicated that it is highly unlikely that these would not be granted to Britain. As we prepare to leave the European Union on  March , we need to ensure that the terms on which we leave – whatever the deal, or no deal, and however it is sold to us by Noel Edmonds, Theresa May, or Boris Johnson – does not leave us in a worse position than we are at the moment – because that wasn’t what we voted for.Mick Whelan is general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef and a member of Labour’s national executive committee.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8686180.1540832893!/image/image.jpg","title":"budget chancellor philip hammond s boost for belfast region city deal","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has welcomed a #m commitment to bolster the proposed #bn Belfast Region City Deal.Chancellor Philip Hammond MP confirmed the signicant funding package as he announced details of the Autumn Budget on Monday.It came days after Belfast Region City Deal propositions were brought to Westminster as partner councils outlined their bid which could deliver around , new jobs.MEA Mayor, Cllr Lindsay Millar, said: “This £m commitment from the Chancellor is brilliant news for Mid and East Antrim and all six of the council areas involved in this vital bid.“Belfast Region City Deal sets out a -year plan to grow the economy, boost jobs and tourism, increasing skills, encouraging investment and developing infrastructure.“The substantial economic opportunity includes plans for around £m of investment in Mid and East Antrim.“This includes proposals to extend The Gobbins clf path, the regeneration of Carrickfergus and the creation of an innovation and inspiration centre at the St Patrick’s site in Ballymena.”MEA Council along with East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson held an engagement event at Westminster last Wednesday morning.

The owners of The Aniseed Lounge in Ballynahinch made the announcement on the eatery’s Facebook page this morning.Husband and we team Nick and Joanne Clough opened the pub restaurant at the site of the former Cloisters bar and grill on Dromore Street in December .With support from Ulster Bank, the ambitious redevelopment project created  jobs.The statement posted on Facebook today said the decision to close had been taken with “teary eyes and heavy hearts.”“It is with great sadness that we must let you know that we have had to make the dficult decision to close the Aniseed Lounge with immediate effect. Unfortunately we were not steadily busy enough to cover the overheads and as it is just the two of us financing the business, it has become impossible to continue to finance the shortfall. Things have been further complicated due to recent family ill health. We took nothing out and put everything in - money, hours, enthusiasm - but unfortunately it wasn’t enough,” the statement, signed by “NJ” said.“We want to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you who has come in the doors and enjoyed our food, drink and craic. To those who have followed us faithfully, supported us and spread the word. We have loved meeting you all and we have made so many great friendships over the past year - for that we are sincerely grateful.“We also want to thank our amazing team of staff - past and present - who have worked hard for us, kept the chin up during quiet times and have developed into a little Aniseed family.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”Eddie lts gym trophy\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co. Antrim secretary was unavailable for comment this morning, but a decision is expected in the coming days.Click here to watch short Facebook video of the St James Swts v Newington game at https:www.facebook AndytownNews videos  "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tiocfaidh a la carte","story":"LONG Quiche, Come Out You Rack Of Lambs, The Frying Column and Turkey Ár Lá – these were just some of the frontrunners for the name of the new cookbook by former Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, who finally settled on The Negotiators Cookbook – Best Kept Secret of the Peace Process.The Negotiators Cookbook is the latest offering from Adams and it gives an insight into a part of the peace process that up until now has had little light shone upon it.The book details the efforts of two of the insiders, Ted Howell and Pádraic Wilson, to sustain the stamina and energy of the Sinn Féin negotiating team during years of high level negotiations with the British government and includes many of their recipes.Speaking at the launch in An Chultúrlann on Monday, Mr Adams said: “I’m here to tell you about one of the best kept secrets of the Irish peace process.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

She loved her dress and having everyone there and danced the whole night. She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it. We canrsquot thank them enough.She said that there were too many to name but she would like to make a special mention of local landscape architect Matthew Morrison, who helped with the sensory garden, the charities RNIB, Angel Eyes, and Murphyrsquos Bar who consistently fund-raised, and Downpatrick Lions Club who organised for a gazebo to be used in the garden for Megan.ldquoIn the early days with Megan, we really didnrsquot know what to expect for her. For us all to be able to celebrate her th birthday is something to be really thankful about, added Leanne..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"St Patrick’s Boys’ former site sold  ","story":"THE former St Patrickrsquos Boysrsquo Primary School site in Downpatrick is to be sold.The Down and Connor diocese has confirmed this week that the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site mdash which was vacated in  when the school merged with the nearby Convent of Mercy Primary for girls mdash offers both commercial and residential potential.The sale does not include the adjacent playing fields.Following the merger of the two schools to form Our Lady and St Patrickrsquos which is based at the Convent of Mercyrsquos former base in Edward Street, the former boysrsquo primary was subsequently demolished.At the time of the merger of two of Downpatrickrsquos oldest schools, which marked the end of single sex primary education in the district, it was suggested a new school would be built, with the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site suggested as a possible base.Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said Downpatrick required an ultra-modern primary school and believed the Education Authority should investigate the full potential of the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site.He also made it clear that local residents and parishioners must be fully consulted about the future development of the former boysrsquo primary school.ldquoIn previous sales of church lands, some church committees carried out a survey of local parishioners to seek their views of the site being proposed for sale. It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
