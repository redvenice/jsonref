There are big consequences because nobody is OK with what happened.

Energy company Octopus has confirmed that with the £5,000 grant, it will offer heat pumps at a similar price to gas boilers - meaning they could cost as little as £3,000 to install.All heating technologies - including gas boilers - work more efficiently and save homeowners money if their home is well insulated - with improving insulation to save energy being a key part of cutting emissions from buildings. This is something that the campaign group Insulate Britain focused its demonstrations on last year.A recent Government study found all homes in the UK, from Victorian mid-terraces to 1960s blocks of flats, are suitable for heat pumps. But energy experts estimate that only about a fifth of homes, some 4.8million, are suitable for a heat pump today. Another 30 per cent, or 8.4million, need minimal changes such as loft and cavity wall insulation, which they say will also cut bills.Homeowners have also been advised that because radiators on heat pumps operate at a lower temperature than with gas, they might need to swap a few of the oldest single panel radiators to ensure they are big enough to heat the room sufficiently. These can normally be replaced with double or triple panelled radiators that fit in the same spot.Underfloor heating works well with heat pumps because it operates at a lower temperature than radiators, so this will continue to work in homes that have the system - but it is not necessary to install it. Boris Johnson acknowledged earlier this week that people are \u0027anxious at the moment about putting in ground source, or air source, heat pumps to heat their homes\u0027. While the Prime Minister said on Wednesday that he believed costs will come down very fast, he has also pointed to hydrogen as an alternative way of heating homes. The gas could be put through the gas pipe network to heat homes with new boilers that can use hydrogen instead of fossil gas. He said: \u0027People are anxious at the moment about putting in ground source, or air source, heat pumps to heat their homes. Everybody\u0027s worried about having to replace their boilers at vast expense.\u0027For some people that will be the right solution, I think the price of those things will come down very fast as more are made. But you\u0027ve also got a look at the possibility of going back to where you were actually in the 60s and 70s when town gas contain a lot of hydrogen. And you could put a lot more hydrogen into the pipes.\u0027The Prime Minister also said that the \u0027ambition to keep going on the path to net zero\u0027 has \u0027not been adulterated or lost at all\u0027.Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, he also threw his weight behind offshore wind in the drive to produce more electricity in the UK.The energy strategy promised by the Prime Minister has been delayed amid reports of Cabinet infighting, including a row over ending the effective moratorium on onshore wind farms.The Prime Minister told MPs that he believed offshore wind had \u0027massive potential\u0027 but made no mention of turbines located inland. He also stressed the need for new nuclear development, including smaller modular reactors.The strategy was promised by Mr Johnson in response to the turmoil in global energy markets caused by Vladimir Putin\u0027s invasion of Ukraine and is aimed at addressing long-term failures to secure domestic production. But while it was expected in March, the plan has been repeatedly pushed back."},{"url":null,"title":"Covid prevalent England rife virus town","story":"Share this article On Thursday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said people must \u0027learn to live with Covid\u0027 as campaigners criticised the end of free testing.He told reporters: \u0027We are one of the most open and free countries in the world now, and that’s because of decisions that we’ve taken as a country… and it is right also as we learn to live with Covid that we withdraw free testing – universally… if it’s not needed any more, but we focus those resources on the people that need it most.

Apart from that, we had them pretty much all available.” A check of the latest odds shows it’s actually a 94 shot. I personally want a bit more value when backing a miracle but there you go. He isn’t giving up though. Oh no. The task has gone down by a whole “very”. “It’s right to underline that this target is very, very difficult and we are not the only team that wants to try and do this miracle,” said Conte. “If you ask me about the past, about our possibility to reach a place in the Champions League, I could say to do it’d be very, very, very difficult. Now after five months I’m seeing great improvement in my team and we have to fight until the end. “We have the possibility to reach this target and it’s important to have this type of ambition and put pressure on ourselves for this target. “To play Champions League next season is important for me, the club, the players, the fans. Everybody. Because to play Champions League is totally different to Europa League or Europa Conference League or not playing in UEFA competition. It’s an important target for many reasons, for the club, because for sure you can play important things.” For the record, Tottenham could move into the top four with victory over Newcastle at the weekend. They’d be ahead of Arsenal on goal difference although the Gunners have two games in hand, the first of those away to Crystal Palace on Monday night.With 11 games to go, Burnley are 19th in the Premier League, four points adrift of 17th-placed Everton. They play the Toffees at home next Wednesday and rock-bottom Norwich away four days later after hosting table-toppers City, who they have suffered nine successive losses to in all competitions. Pope told a press conference: “You want to pick up points every game. Eleven games to go, in the position we are in, it’s not necessarily targeting certain games. “It’s going into every game, performing that game plan, and putting in good performances to get results when they come. “Obviously when you play teams around you it is always going to be important. But first of all City is a massive game for us. “It’s a home game and we can’t just sit back and write it off, that’s something that has not really been our style. (We’ll try to) go out there and use that opportunity to start a good run for ourselves.” Sean Dyche’s men were beaten only once in seven outings before losing each of their last three games, against Leicester, Chelsea and Brentford. Asked for his analysis of Burnley’s relegation battle, Pope said: “Of course, the reality is the reality, there’s no hiding from that. “But we know what we’ve got to do, and we know what we have got – a squad full of leaders, good characters and players who have been in this position before.” “I think it can only be a good thing – we’ve been in this position before, had to dig ourselves out of a bad start and bad positions and get ourselves over the line. “We’ve got a really good core group of players who’ve been here before and seen this situation and seen it through to a good outcome. That is what we are after.” Dias has missed the last four weeks with a hamstring injury and Guardiola does not expect the Portugal defender to be back in time for the top of the table clash.  “The doctor said for four to six weeks. We need 10 days or two weeks more,” he said.Stones returned to City early from international duty but has recovered sufficiently for the trip to Turf Moor. “The plan depends on the players when I saw them today and yesterday,” added Guardiola. “We still have nine games to play. We will go game by game. We know what we have to do. We have to win games. It will be difficult, but we will try.”Maguire was booed when representing England ahead of Tuesday’s 3-0 friendly win over Ivory Coast at Wembley. While United’s interim manager found this puzzling, he was asked why Maguire can also attract attention on social media. Rangnick also dismissed Paul Pogba’s complaint at the start of the international break that being asked to play in a wide attacking berth for United instead of his usual midfield position is difficult, the Frenchman contrasting this with how he operates in his preferred role consistently for his country. A senior security official for the host country’s government told the Associated Press that flags could be confiscated from people to protect them from being attacked by others. Fare, which was part of a group of 16 organisations which is seeking assurances from tournament organisers over the safety of fans from the LGBTIQ+ community, said the suggestion that flags would be removed to ensure safety would be seen as a pretext and that the “bigger danger” to the community was the state, not intolerant supporters. “The reassurances of safety we are seeking from the Supreme Committee and government of Qatar are categorical,” a statement from the network read. “The LGBTIQ+ community should be allowed freedom of expression and be protected in exercising those rights. This is the international norm. “The rainbow flag will be worn by thousands of people in Qatar, by LGBTIQ+ visitors and regular supporters. The idea that the flag, which is now a recognised and universal symbol of ersity and equality, will be removed from people to protect them, will not be considered acceptable, and will be seen as a pretext. “From our experience of Qatar and the work we have done there we do not expect the local Qatari population or visiting fans to be attacked for wearing the rainbow flag, the bigger danger comes from state actions.” Qatari law criminalises same-sex relationships, but FIFA and the Supreme Committee insist supporters from the LGBTIQ+ community will be made welcome in the country during the World Cup. The ex-player and managers contingent is as follows.  Cafu, Lothar Matthaus, Jay-Jay Okocha, Tim Cahill, Qatari legend Adel Ahmed MalAllah, Iran legend Ali Daei, former coach of just about everyone Bora Milutinovic and Algerian legend Rabah Madjer (he scored the winner in the 1987 European Cup final).Idris Elba’s most famous role had this to say about a Qatari summer: “That’s like a 40-degree day. Ain’t nobody got nothing to say about a 40-degree day. 50? Bring a smile to your face.” Bruno has been very good for United but it is true to say there is more to achieve at United and that the best really has to come from the current team.  1) Who scores the goal which prompts Alan to screech: “Shit, did you see that? He must have a foot like a traction engine.” Answer: It’s Belgium’s Enzo Scifo, a player who in my memory seemed to play in around six straight World Cups and be aged 28 in all of them.  2) Which goalie has “football pie all over his shirt”? Answer: The trackie bottoms were the giveaway. It’s Cameroon’s Thomas N’Kono.“Part of the World Cup is visiting places you’ve not had the chance to go to. I love travel and if there’s a trip to go somewhere to improve my knowledge of the world and culture, I’m the first name down.” Southgate is not blind to the social situation in Qatar. Far from it. Neither are his players, especially after they were given a presentation on it in the early part of last week. The midfielder Jordan Henderson described the content as “shocking” and “horrendous”.“The putative golden draw of USA, Iran and Canada, besides probably looking like a fairly difficult group, can’t actually happen because two teams from the same confederation can’t be in the same group, with the exception of European sides, of which there can be two.”  I still think anyone would happily take the USA from Pot 2 though! 1) Who scores the goal which prompts Alan to screech: “Shit, did you see that?

Back to domestic matters and Liverpool have the early kick-off on Saturday. After trailing Manchester City by 73 points at one stage, they could go top for around 150 minutes with a home win over Watford.

The two had formed an aid group called the Human First Coalition, helping those trying to flee Afghanistan following the US withdrawal last summer following a 20-year war. Their release follows “100 days of intense negotiations between the Biden administration and their captors,” CNN reported, stating that the Democratic Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal and national security adviser Jake Sullivan were among those involved. A statement from Safi Rauf was released by the Human First Coalition, in which he thanked those who worked for his freedom. “We were released due to the efforts of the US government (most especially political officer JP Feldmayer, Special Representative Tom West, and Lt. Col. Jason Hock), our family and loved ones, the Qatari government, the British government, our team at Human First Coalition, and countless friends in country, in the region, and all over the world.” the statement said.Senate leaders were indicating to reporters on Friday that a deal was within reach, with a possible vote over the next week. But the package is a pale reflection of the original White House request for $22bn, cutting deep into even the most recent proposal set at $15.6bn. A large slice of the savings will probably be made at the expense of efforts to support vaccination drives around the world. The Biden administration had asked for $5bn, but as final talks continued it appeared that the amount for global aid could be slashed to as little as $1bn. Leading Democrats have expressed dismay at the reduction in planned global vaccine efforts. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, called the latest proposal “shameful”, pointing out that low vaccination rates in parts of the world run the risk of new Covid variants arising. “We have said, we have pronounced, everyone knows: none of us is safe, unless all of us are safe,” Pelosi said.

In return, DeSantis says Disney “crossed a line” and is now threatening to strip the company of the self-governing status it has enjoyed for almost 50 years, and which has allowed it to expand operations across central Florida almost unchecked. “Disney has alienated a lot of people now,” DeSantis said at a West Palm Beach press conference, reported Friday by CNN. “And so the political influence they’re used to wielding, I think has dissipated. And so the question is, why would you want to have special privileges in the law at all? And I don’t think that we should.” His comments followed a tweet earlier this week by Republican state congressman Spencer Roach saying discussions were under way to revoke the 1967 Reedy Creek Improvement Act, which gave Disney autonomy over its own affairs. As for Disney, which employs about 80,000 “cast members” in Florida, its opposition reflects something of a reversal after it initially refused to condemn the bill. Some Disney workers in California and Florida walked out in protest.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Minister for Health has defended the Government’s decision not to reimpose mandatory mask wearing in response to a recent surge in Covid-19 cases. Stephen Donnelly said the original pandemic powers were draconian and appropriate for a time of emergency, but that the State now has to move towards living with the disease.However, the Minister encouraged members of the public to wear masks on public transport, in crowded places and in healthcare settings.“Everything helps,” he said of mask wearing. The advice from the chief medical officer was in line with the decision not to reintroduce mask related curbs, he said. When asked if he was prepared to publish that advice, he said he was as he felt that the more advice there was “out there” the better. Asked if he was hopeful that the peak of the latest surge had passed, the Minister expressed “cautious optimism” given the five-day rolling average of cases was falling. Once the peak had passed in other countries there was a rapid decline in case numbers, he added. The number of people in hospital with the disease fell by 63 on Friday morning to 1,472. This included 59 people in intensive care units (ICUs), an increase of one in 24 hours. A further 5,750 positive PCR tests were reported by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on Friday afternoon and it said 5,089 people had registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal on Thursday. Isolation periodElsewhere, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said he did not expected “significant changes” to the advice on the seven-day isolation period for people with Covid-19.He is just emerging from completing a week of isolation himself after testing positive for the virus and was speaking at the opening of the Himalayan Hills habitat at Dublin Zoo. The mooted change to the isolation period was considered at a Cabinet Covid-19 sub committee meeting on Thursday. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan is examining the current guidance including whether the isolation period could be reduced. Mr Varadkar said Dr Holohan would provide advice to Government on the matter in the next couple of weeks. “I don’t anticipate a significant change, quite frankly, because this is down to the science and the incubation period of virus is what it is and the infectious period is what it is,” the Tánaiste said. “But advice which we’re going to emphasise more and more is that for people who are under 55 and medically well, you don’t need to get a test actually. “What you need to do if you have symptoms is to isolation and that once your symptoms are gone for two days then you’re free to return to relatively normal life.”He said people aged over 55 or those with a medical condition should get tested. Past the peakMr Varadkar told RTÉ’s Prime Time on Thursday that it was Dr Holohan’s view that “we are close to or past” the peak of the second Omicron wave.Speaking on Friday, the Tánaiste said there is reassurance that, two days in a row, the number of people in hospital with Covid has fallen and the number in ICU is staying between 40 and 60.Mr Varadkar said the advice from the CMO is that Ireland no longer needs legally binding restrictions like those related to masks.“We’re still encouraging people - isolate if you’re sick, wear a mask in the appropriate settings and please get that booster that’s really important.”He said 700,000 people who have not had their booster vaccination and encouraged them to get the jab to protect themselves and others.Earlier, the Covid-19 lead with the Irish College of General Practitioners said a “cultural change” was needed in Irish society so it is considered “impolite” to go to work or school with what could be symptoms of the disease. Dr Nuala O’Connor said it was important to protect the vulnerable in society and that anyone experiencing symptoms should stay at home and wear a mask if they needed to go out.She told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland there were indications that the current wave had peaked. When asked about possibly reducing the number of isolation days to seven, Dr O’Connor said there was evidence about fewer days of isolation being sufficient and such a change had already been introduced in other jurisdictions. She said she did not think there would be any announcement about this happening in the State in the near future.Booster shotsShe said the focus should remain on staying at home if experiencing symptoms and getting booster vaccines. Ireland had a good record on vaccination, but only 75 per cent of the population had received a booster and 50 per cent of seriously ill patients in ICU had not been vaccinated, she added.Any respiratory illness such as flu is an inconvenience and did not carry the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation or death, but there are always vulnerable people in the community who did not have the same level of protection. “As a society we need to protect these people” she said. “Moving forward it is important to have a culture change.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"new cost of living measures expected in coming weeks","story":"Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan: Electricity companies may be required to offer their lowest rates to all customers.

He said the Government’s focus was to target resources to assist the people and sectors hardest hit.Last night, Mr Martin told the Dublin Chamber of Commerce the impact of the war in Ukraine and arrival of refugees in Ireland would be “unlike anything we have seen in our lifetimes and it will, I believe, require an extraordinary societal response”.‘Terrific burden’ He said it would place “another terrific burden on our public services”.Speaking on condition of anonymity, one Minister said another package of measures was inevitable and the only question was “what, how much and when”.Officials from Mr Ryan’s Department of Energy have been meeting with energy suppliers to discuss contingency plans in case the war in Ukraine disrupts imports of Russian oil and gas into the EU.Asked about imports of liquid natural gas (LNG) – which the Green Party has opposed – Mr Ryan said he would never rule anything out at a time of crisis in energy supplies. That included commercial LNG and State-run LNG facilities – as well as nuclear – if shown to be economic and viable, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"crucial role junk dna revealed whole human genome finally decoded","story":"The entire human genome has finally been sequenced, nearly 20 years after scientists first claimed to have made the breakthrough.In 2003, researchers from the Human Genome Project announced that the blueprint of life had been decoded but they had missed out around eight per cent of DNA, believing it was repetitive and unimportant.Since then experts have come to realise that this junk DNA plays a crucial role in human biology, and have finally sequenced the missing pieces - a development that may finally explain why some people develop certain traits and are at greater risk of disease.The size of the missing chunk is so large that scientists say it is the equivalent of deciphering a whole new chromosome.“Finishing the human genome sequence was like putting on a new pair of glasses,” said Dr Karen Miga, of the University of California, Santa Cruz.“Now that we can clearly see everything we are one step closer to understanding what it all means.”The 19-year endeavour to complete the picture has involved scientists from all over the world, including Cambridge University and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.Much of the newly decoded material comes from the centre of chromosomes - or centromeres - and the very tips - the telomeres - both of which are linked to cell ision and the development of cancer and degenerative diseases.The team discovered more than 100 new genes that produce proteins, the molecules which do most of the work in cells and that are required for the structure, function, and regulation of tissues and organs.However, they also found mysterious pockets of non-coding DNA that do not make proteins but still seem to play an important role in cellular functions and may lie at the heart of conditions in which cell ision runs amok, such as cancer.“We are finally digging into what we once called junk DNA, because we could not understand it or look at it accurately,” said Dr Giulio Formenti of the Rockefeller University, New York.“We now know that many diseases are linked to structural repeats in the centromere, and now that these sequences are no longer missing from the human reference genome we can begin to map the origins of these diseases.”To complete the genome, scientists used DNA from a non-cancerous tumour called a hydatidiform mole, which occurs when a human embryo rejects DNA from the mother and instead duplicates DNA from the father.This mistake in fertilisation means the tumour has DNA from just one inidual, making it easier to sequence. This, coupled with advances in genetic sequencing over the past two decades, allowed researchers to fill in the gaps.“You would think that, with 92 per cent of the genome completed long ago another eight per cent wouldn’t contribute much,” said Prof Erich Jarvis of Rockefeller.“But from that missing eight per cent, we’re now gaining an entirely new understanding of how cells ide, allowing us to study a number of diseases we had not been able to get at before.”The breakthrough could also help unpick the origins of humanity. Some of the genes that were missing in the original genome are now thought to be critically important in driving the bigger, more connected brains which separate humans from apes.Researchers also found that the centromeres contained layers of older sequences which appear to be no longer used by the cell but may hold clues to how our DNA worked in the past.“It\u0027s almost like layers of fossils,” said Dr Nicolas Altemose, of University of California, Berkeley.“As you move away from the site of the active centromere you get more and more degraded, to the point where if you go out to the furthest shores of this sea of repetitive sequences you start to see the ancient centromere.”He added: “Before, we just had the blurriest picture of what was there, and now it\u0027s crystal clear.”The research, by members of the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium, was published in six papers in the journal Science.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine war: Listen to our daily podcastRussia-Ukraine latest news: EU stockpiling drugs in case of nuclear strikeKeir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson of using conversion therapy row to \u0026#39distract\u0026#39 from cost-of-living crisisDown’s Syndrome guidance to be given to councils and hospitals under historic new lawApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsUkrainian helicopters blow up fuel depot in daring dawn raid inside Russian territoryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan van tam having sleepless nights spring covid booster","story":"Jonathan Van-Tam said he is having sleepless nights worrying about over-75s coming forward for their spring booster jabs on his final appearance as England\u0027s Deputy Chief Medical Officer.Prof Van-Tam, who became one of most familiar faces of the Covid pandemic, announced in January that he would be resigning.Speaking at the Royal Society of Medicine\u0027s Covid conference on Thursday, his last appearance in the role, he said he was optimistic that countries were better prepared to respond to future pandemicsBut he warned: I wouldn\u0027t want anybody to take away from our discussion … the idea that this is over, because case rates here in the UK are really, really high and hospitalisations in London, for example, are becoming exceptionally high again.And what keeps me awake at night is whether the people we have called, over-75s, for their second booster dose are going to come forward really rapidly in the next few days and weeks, because it\u0027s going to be important.His comments come after Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser, said four-monthly boosters cannot continue and that it was likely the NHS would move to an annual jab programme.The latest official figures show 15,632 people in England were in hospital with Covid as of Wednesday, up 18 per cent week-on-week and the highest since Jan 19 when the number was 15,742.Average daily hospital admissions in England of people with Covid currently stand at 2,050 – the highest since Feb 5, 2021. But the proportion of hospital patients with Covid in England who are being treated primarily for something else is broadly unchanged at just over half.Across the UK, 19,534 patients were in hospital with Covid as of March 30.

An estimated eight per cent of people aged 35 to 49 were likely to have had the virus last week, or around one in 13.Prevalence of Covid-19 is higher among these groups than at any point since ONS estimates began in spring 2020.Kara Steel, the senior statistician for the ONS Covid-19 infection survey, said there had been notable increases in infections among older age groups.The rapid rise continues to be fuelled by the growth of the omicron BA.2 variant across the UK, she said.Infection levels among 50 to 69-year-olds and over-70s have nearly doubled in the space of two weeks.The proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with Covid-19 is estimated to have risen to 7.6 per cent, or one in 13 people, but this is still below the peak reached at the start of the year.The trend in infections among people aged two to 24 is described as uncertain by the ONS.Prevalence among all age groups remains highest for children between age two and school year 6, with one in 11 likely to have had Covid-19 last week.For children in school years 7 to 11, the latest estimate is one in 20, while for those between school year 12 and age 24 it is one in 18.Infection levels have also continued to increase across all regions of England, the ONS added. Levels are highest in south-west England, with one in 11 people estimated to have had the virus last week, followed by south-east England (one in 12), and London and eastern England (both one in 13).Professor James Naismith, the director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said: omicron BA.2 is extremely good at infecting people.It remains my view that unless you are completely shielded or are not susceptible to the virus, by the summer you are more likely to have been infected with BA.2 than not. This is literally living with the virus by being infected with it.Omicron BA.2 is less severe, but the main reason we have endured this wave with many fewer deaths is vaccination. Vaccination has meant the elderly and vulnerable have been able to fight off this virus without very serious illness after being infected. Omicron BA.2 still kills the vulnerable unvaccinated.On Thursday, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said people must learn to live with Covid as campaigners criticised the end of free testing for most people in England on Friday. We are one of the most open and free countries in the world now, and that\u0027s because of decisions that we\u0027ve taken as a country... and it is right also as we learn to live with Covid that we withdraw free testing - universally... if it\u0027s not needed any more, but we focus those resources on the people that need it most. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re doing.However, Professor Tim Spector from King\u0027s College London, who runs the Zoe Covid tracking app, said the timing of the end of free testing couldn\u0027t really be worse.He said England was now in a situation of having to rely on the public to actually do the right thing and get these tests themselves when they get sick.He told Times Radio that if we\u0027re not having free testing, let\u0027s have a clear policy on how you would know that you\u0027re infected, and therefore you can self-isolate.To do that, the Government needs to admit that the symptoms of Covid have changed in the last two years, and that 80 per cent of people now present with cold-like symptoms.And there should be a public health campaign to say at the moment, when your chances of having Covid are greater than a cold... test if you can afford it - (and) even if you can\u0027t - assume you\u0027ve got Covid.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine war: Listen to our daily podcastRussia-Ukraine latest news: EU stockpiling drugs in case of nuclear strikeKeir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson of using conversion therapy row to \u0026#39distract\u0026#39 from cost-of-living crisisDown’s Syndrome guidance to be given to councils and hospitals under historic new lawApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsUkrainian helicopters blow up fuel depot in daring dawn raid inside Russian territoryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia turning north korea","story":"The young, blonde prosecutor sat stiffly at her desk as Kazan’s local television news cameras rolled. “I can confirm that we have apprehended an inidual in possession of one 50kg bag of sugar, which he was selling above market prices,” the uniformed spokeswoman intoned gravely. The next shot was of the sugar-speculating criminal himself, a paunchy middle-aged man filmed with a hidden camera standing next to the open boot of a car with the incriminating bag in plain sight.‘Economic speculation’ – the Soviet-era crime of buying something cheap and selling it for more – is just one of the ways in which post-invasion Putin’s Russia is coming to resemble North Korea. Another is the massive, flag-waving patriotic rallies attended by tens of thousands of state employees bussed in for the occasion like the one Putin held last month at Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium. Loyal film and TV stars showed up to shower praise on Russia’s great leader and his ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine. Putin himself took the stage – duly cleared of people, to preserve his paranoiacally strict two-year Covid isolation – to give a rambling speech on Russia’s historic duty to rid the world of “the scourge of fascism,” with digressions on the military prowess of centuries-dead Russian saints. The only difference was that the crowd did not quite live up to North Korean levels of discipline, with Putin’s speech cut short halfway through the live broadcast as sections of the crowd began to wolf-whistle their leader – a serious insult in Russian performance culture. And instead of a Mao suit, Putin wore an £8,500 black fur-lined Loro Piana parka jacket.Meanwhile economic sanctions and a draconian crackdown on what Russians can see and say in the war’s wake have abruptly swung the country towards full North Korean totalitarianism. Food shortages caused by panic buying, and jolting inflation in the wake of the ruble’s 40 per cent collapse have also helped to take a once-vibrant – if tightly controlled – society back to the days of the USSR.‘Hoarders’ were regularly blamed by authorities for chronic food shortages during the dying days of the USSR. Now, with Western sanctions starting to bite, the old crimes of hoarding and speculation are back in the news – along with empty shelves as panicked shoppers stock up on basic foodstuffs. Rationing, too, has made a comeback, with supermarkets such as Pyatorochka, Perekrestok and Dixi limiting the amount of sugar, buckwheat and flour that inidual shoppers can buy. “Ah yes, I can see with my own eyes how we are returning to the greatness of the Soviet Union,” joked Svetlana Ulyanskaya, 36, the manager of a cosmetics store in central Moscow. “We were a powerful and respected country – and I remember trailing around shops with my mother looking for a fresh chicken. That must be the sign.”  In truth, the disappearance of basic products and the rise of ‘speculation’ has more to do with panic-buying and fear of inflation than real, Soviet-era shortages. Russia is a net exporter of sugar, grain, buckwheat and other staple foods. But that has not stopped prices of onions going up 160 per cent, whole cabbage by 208 per cent and sugar by 56 per cent, according to Russian food writers Pavel and Olga Syutkin. Buckwheat and flour shot up by 37 per cent and 21 per cent respectively in the month since Putin’s war on Ukraine began. Overall prices have risen at their fastest rate in more than two decades as Russia starts to feel the economic consequences of sanctions, according to the Rosstat statistics agency.For the Kremlin, it’s “beating sanctions” that are the priority. Nightly news bulletins regularly feature messages from top ministers and from Putin himself assuring the public that Russia can stand on its own. “Russians have absolutely no need to run to the shops and buy up buckwheat, sugar and toilet paper,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last week. “The fuss around supplies in food stores is based on emotions.” He added that the government was “considering” creating a state monopoly for basic foodstuffs – and introducing Soviet-style price controls. In another throwback to the Soviet era, Russia’s agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev has appeared regularly with news of harvests and boosting food production. “Sugar deliveries are going on without interruption and factories are working round the clock,” Patrushev – son of the powerful Security Council secretary and former FSB director Nikolai Patrushev – told the state-run Rossiya-24 TV channel last week. “As for the coming season, we are significantly increasing the land dedicated to growing sugar. That will allow us to provide enough sugar not only for Russia, but also our partners in the Eurasian Economic Union.”Again, this echoes North Korea, which has always struggled with food shortages, exacerbated by the pandemic. Kim Jong-un has compared the current situation to the country’s worst disaster in the 1990s, known as the Arduous March, where hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine.Much will rest on this year’s harvest: last year’s crops were partly destroyed by a series of typhoons. To ensure this year is as successful as possible, tens of thousands of North Koreans have been conscripted into the fields to help with farming. Kim Jong-un has also reportedly ordered that every grain of rice in the country is to be secured and that everyone who eats should go and help with the harvest.Back in Russia, some retailers have tried to make a joke of the sanctions. The Borodaty Yezh cafe on Rozhdestvensky Boulevard produced a light-hearted edition of its fast food menu that featured a burger called “Brezhnev’s Kiss,” a variation on a Big Mac that features beetroot called “Babushka’s Love” and a hotdog called “Glav Myas,” after the Soviet meat production ministry. But Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of Russia’s state duma, apparently spoke in deadly earnest earlier this month when he proposed that Russia should start its own McDonald’s-style fast food chain called Uncle Vanya’s. A Moscow company has already filed a trademark for Uncle Vanya that features the distinctive yellow-on-red ‘M’ of the McDonald’s logo on its side to make a ‘B’ – ‘V’ in Russian, for Vanya. More serious, though, than a lack of Big Macs or Ikea furniture is a sudden shortage of Western pharmaceuticals. Moscow cancer patient Anna Kovalenko, 68, had been taking a French-made chemotherapy drug for the past 10 months, at the state’s expense. But when she went to pick up her new prescription she was told that western drugs would no longer be available, and was given a Russian-made substitute. “It’s much worse – so much worse that I stopped taking it,” said Kovalenko, who found that the new drug gave her such bad pains in her legs she could not walk. “They told me that if I was to be angry at anyone I should be angry at the West, which is punishing us.” In truth, supplies of pharmaceuticals are exempt from Western sanctions on Russia – though a combination of the collapsing value of the ruble, a severe decline in EU-Russia road transport and hoarding has made them all but impossible to obtain. “I want to tell the public: you don’t need to stock up,” Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said in a televised cabinet meeting with Putin earlier this month. The predictable result was a rush to hoard. The newspaper Kommersant also reported that sales of over-the-counter anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants had quadrupled in the first week of the war in what was dubbed the “start of a mass depression.”The Kremlin’s propaganda machine has been pushing back hard against the evidence of rising prices, disappearing goods and closed shops. Last week the Vremya nightly news reported that it was the West, not Russia, which was suffering from sanctions, claiming that consumers in Germany and across Europe were panic-buying sunflower oil and showing footage of a man pouring it in a car’s fuel tank because of increase in oil prices. Indeed, even relatively young Russians can remember previous ruble crashes in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea, as well as in 2008 and 1998. And relentless state propaganda has changed perceptions of the USSR too, from a time of repression and hardship into a rose-tinted golden age of stability and fairness.“The political and economic suicide of the Putin regime has lowered Russia to the same level as North Korea,” wrote liberal political analyst Andrei Kolesnikov on last week’s New Times website.

The millionaire Tory complained yesterday that questions about his super-rich we Akshata Murthy were not “fair game”.After Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars over a joke about his we, Mr Sunak added: “Both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good. But Labour ’s leader today said it was a “fundamental question of principle”, in the “public interest” and “not a personal attack”.Keir Starmer told Sky News: “I would have thought the Chancellor would actually want to come clean on this and say actually, ‘I can be very very clear that my household doesn’t benefit from any money that’s come in any way from Russia during this invasion of Ukraine ’.“It’s a simple question, I think he should just answer it, it would actually help his wehe just answered that question.” Hours later, sources told the BBC Infosys - in which Ms Murthy owns a stake - was closing its office in Russia.  Mr Sunak faced questions over his weaposs business affairs following the Spring Statement last week. The Chancellor has urged firms to “think very carefully about their investments in Russia”, adding: “There is no case for new investment in Russia”. Ms Murthy owns a .% stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her billionaire father NR Narayana Murthy, which has continued to operate from their Moscow office. Her stake is currently worth £million, while the family hold a combined £.bn shareholding in Infosys - an increase from £.billion that was last reported in .Mr Sunak told theBBC: You know, I think it’s totally fine for people to take shots at me. It’s fair game.I’m the one sitting here and that’s what I signed up for. Actually, it’s very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my we, and you know, beyond that actually, with regard to my father in law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he’s achieved.  No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he’s wonderful and has achieved a huge amount, as I said, I’m enormously proud of him. But Labour’s leader said today: “As far as the Chancellor’s we is concerned, there’s just a fundamental question of principle here, which is, is their household benefiting from money made in Russia when the government’s put in place sanctions  “That is in the public interest for us to have an answer to. “I’m not attacking their family, I don’t agree with that way of doing politics. “But I do want to know is, is the Chancellor’s household benefiting from money from a company that’s investing in money when the government’s saying quite rightly that nobody should be doing that ”  The Chancellor has previously said he “followed the ministerial code to the letter” regarding his financial interests. A Treasury spokesman told the Mirror: “The Prime Minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has confirmed he is completely satisfied with the Chancellor’s propriety of arrangements and that he has followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests.” The Ministerial Code states: “Ministers must provide their Permanent Secretary with a list, in writing, of all relevant interests known to them, which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. “Inidual declarations, and a note of any action taken in respect of inidual interests, are then passed to the Cabinet Office Propriety and Ethics team and the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyInfosysBBCThe TreasurySpring StatementPoliticsBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.”  British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Chancellor complained that his we Akshata Murthy was not fair game following scrutiny over her shares in a company operating in Russia.He admitted he had not had the best of weekends following last weekaposs Spring Statement, which was widely criticised for not doing enough to help Brits hit by the cost of living crisis.Mr Sunak compared himself to the Hollywood actor, who slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars for making a joke about his we Jada Pinkett Smith.Will Smith appeared to lose his temper when the comedian made a gag about his weaposs shaved head. She has previously spoken about deciding to cut her hair as she suffers from alopecia. Speaking to the BBCaposs Newscast podcast, Mr Sunak said: Someone said, aposJoe Root, Will Smith, and me – not the best of weekends for any of us.apos  But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good. Mr Sunak faced questions over his weaposs business affairs following the Spring Statement last week. Ms Murthy owns a .% stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her father NR Narayana Murthy, which has continued to operate from their Moscow office. Her stake is currently worth £million, while the family hold a combined £.bn shareholding in Infosys - an increase from £.billion that was last reported in .Mr Sunak told the BBC: You know, I think it’s totally fine for people to take shots at me. It’s fair game.I’m the one sitting here and that’s what I signed up for. Actually, it’s very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my we, and you know, beyond that actually, with regard to my father in law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he’s achieved.  No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he’s wonderful and has achieved a huge amount, as I said, I’m enormously proud of him. The Chancellor has previously said he “followed the ministerial code to the letter” regarding his financial interests. A Treasury spokesman told the Mirror: “The Prime Minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has confirmed he is completely satisfied with the Chancellor’s propriety of arrangements and that he has followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests.” The Ministerial Code states: “Ministers must provide their Permanent Secretary with a list, in writing, of all relevant interests known to them, which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. “Inidual declarations, and a note of any action taken in respect of inidual interests, are then passed to the Cabinet Office Propriety and Ethics team and the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCRishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Keir Starmer said the government “just doesn’t get” it as Kit Malthouse said his family is finding it “quite tricky... day-to-day”.The North West Hampshire MP made the comment on the same day he receives a £,-a-year pay rise for MPs. Speaking in front of a burning fireplace in his home, the father-of-three told LBC Radio: As you know, Iaposve got children. They need to be fed and that cost is rising. My fuel prices are rising quite signicantly, and I have to say that in my constituency Iaposm on oil central heating still, sadly. He added: We are feeling it very signicantly. MP Neil Coyle, who sits on the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee said: “Malthouse should apologise for his gross insensitivity and focus on helping his constituents and everyone battling budgets rather than talking about himself.”Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: Just how out of touch are this lot The fact a government minister in the wealthiest % of taxpayers is struggling will ramp up furious pressure on Rishi Sunak to announce more help.Last week the Chancellor made National Insurance thresholds more generous and unveiled a temporary fuel duty cut - but neither will help the worst-paid part time workers with no car as incomes drop by the fastest since records began in the s.  He has already announced a £ council tax discount that not everyone is eligible for, and a £ energy bills discount that only comes in October and must be paid back. Keir Starmer blasted the Government’s “pathetic” response as National Insurance, energy bills, council tax and inflation all soar - with bills expected to jump again on October . Energy firms’ websites crashed yesterday as people submitted meter readings ahead of today’s £ surge in annual bills. Charities said the rise will double the number of ‘fuel stress’ families struggling to pay the gas bill to million. The TUC demanded an emergency budget with general secretary Frances O’Grady saying: “This is a living standards emergency. Last week’s Spring Statement was woefully inadequate.” And parents told Save the Children they would be giving their children shared baths and cold dinners, or even sending them to bed hungry. Bethany Fern, a -year-old single mum to a seven-year-old and three-year-old from Southport, told the charity: “Iaposm going to try and cut back even more on what we spend on food and try to freeze more.“We’ll be eating a lot more cold meals, triple-checking that plugs are turned offnot being used and limiting TV even more than we already do. “We already have the heating off a lot, and my children rely on extra layers, duvets and weighted blankets. “They have to have shared baths or not fresh baths between each other to preserve the boiler from heating water.” Another single mum-of-three, who works full time, told LBC Radio she keeps her kids warm with hot water bottles, can only afford one meal a day and eats their leftovers.Heating oil - used by many rural homes and not subject to the price cap on gas and electric bills - has rocketed in price after Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine and peaked at p a litre last month.Minister and father-of-three Mr Malthouse said: “Lots of people in rural areas are suffering from the oil price rise. So we are feeling it very signicantly.“I have to confess to you, we did convert last year to electric vehicles, so we are feeling the electric price but not through the petrol. So it is a challenge for everybody. Mr Malthouse earns £, as an MP following a .% rise today. Together with his salary as Policing Minister he earns £, a year.He said his family tradition was to have the heating off from April  - but with Britain hit by late Spring snow and ice, he had lit a fire in his fireplace.Mr Malthouse had been asked directly what other “economies” he was having to make in his household. He insisted Chancellor Rishi Sunak could act again, but warned the UK had “huge debt” and it would only happen “ the economy allows”. He said: “He is monitoring it on a daily basis,he needs to move further in the future,the economy allows us to do that, don’t forget we’re carrying huge debts at the moment, then I know he’ll look very seriously at doing so.” Save the Children director Dan Paskins blasted the government’s response - including raising benefits by just .%, half the inflation rate - “isn’t good enough”. He said: “The rise in energy prices will be devastating for families on low incomes. “We’ve already seen families having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children. “These price rises will undoubtedly leave millions of parents wondering how they will be able to cope in the months ahead. Unless families are provided with more support, this increase in energy bills will leave more children living in cold and damp homes, going to bed hungry, and missing out on the opportunities they need to grow and thrive.” One working single mum who remained anonymous told the charity: “I actually feel physically sick. I feel pressurised to work more hours even when Iaposm already working as much as I can.“I often do more work after my daughter goes to bed to make the most of the time I have without it affecting her.” Labour leader Keir Starmer blasted: I think most people are clear that ... the Government really needed to step up in its Spring Statement last week.“They failed to do so and their response is frankly pathetic on a very, very dficult day for millions of people. “Energy bills are going up far more than weaposve ever seen on record. People are really struggling and I just donapost think the Government gets it.  Government minister Kit Malthouse said: I canapost pretend to you it isnapost tough. It is going to be.” Liverpool-born Mr Malthouse, , is a close ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Before entering politics he was a chartered accountant at Deloitte before setting up County Finance Group. As chairman, he trousered £,-a-year for between  and  hours’ work a month, according to the MP’s register of interests. He is believed to have given up the role after becoming a minister in early . He also holds shares in County Finance Group Ltd and County Business Finance Ltd.  He was elected to the ultra-safe Tory seat of North West Hampshire in  and enjoys a , majority. He married Juliana Fahrain  years ago. She is managing director of Kun Europe, which “provides a range of services to The Kun Shoulder Rest, the worldaposs leading shoulder rest for violin and viola”. They have one son and one daughter together. He also has a son from a previous marriage. Labour’s leader urged ministers to examine hiking benefits by the rate of inflation - .% and set to peak at almost % - instead of .% now which is a real-terms cut. As the cost-of-living crisis intensied, the Labour leader said people were “tossing and turning in their beds about how they’re going to pay for this”. He said people are “seeing nothing from the government”, who “don’t realise” how badly people are struggling. He added he was hearing of people keeping the heating at C as they canapost afford any more. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. But askedbenefits should rise in line with inflation, Mr Starmer stopped short of giving a guarantee that they would under a Labour government.Instead he told Sky News:: “I think we’ve got to look at it for that very reason because otherwise people fall behind.“That’s what we wanted to see from the Government last week, that’s what we didn’t see from the Government last week. “Frankly,the Government put a package on the table that Parliament could agree we could get on with this. “But the Government just doesn’t get the scale of the problem for millions and millions of people.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Trades Union CongressConservative PartyLabour PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Save the ChildrenKit MalthouseSpring StatementSnowCouncil taxEnergy billsLiving standardsOil pricesPrice risesSingle mumPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, critics have called for the review to be reopened and more money to be pumped into the armed forces following the outbreak of war in Europe. Defending the study, Adm Sir Tony told Whitehall’s Institute for Government think-tank: “It rightly identied Russia as an acute threat, it reinforced that the way that we best protect our national security against that particular threat is through collective defence - and we are in the world’s most powerful military alliance, called NATO.”  The former First Sea Lord said British troops “must be more active and engaged in the world” to “protect and advance the national interest and our shared democratic values”. Rivals were trying to “challenge and undermine the international, rules-based system here in Europe and where”, warned the naval officer.  He also launched a blistering personal attack on the Russian President, whom he branded “a weaker and more diminished figure today than he was a month ago”. “In many ways, Putin has already lost,” said Adm Sir Tony, . “Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements. “He has failed to recognise how deeply the notions of sovereignty, democracy and national identity have taken root in Ukraine.  “Like all authoritarians, he allowed himself to be misled as to his own strength, including the effectiveness of the Russian armed forces. “He has failed to anticipate the unity and cohesion that exists among the free nations of the world, here in Europe and obviously far beyond. “His actions to date have done more to galvanise than ide and have shown Ukraine to have the one thing that Russia conspicuously lacks, which is real friends.” Adm Sir Tony described NATO as “stronger and more united than at any time I can remember”.

Denise Wallington, from Bedfont in west London, retired from work in  but vowed sheaposd never become a boring nan. After joining her local gym so she could go swimming, Deniseaposs attention was caught by the dance music blaring from an exercise class one day. Since then, sheaposs got herself a gruelling workout routine which sees her in the gym every day for two and a half hours. She said: I was dreading turning  in September , but I donapost feel my age at all. I broke up with someone recently and Iaposm even fitter now Iaposve made the gym the number one love in my le!After quitting work, Denise knew she needed to get active and decided to get herself a gym membership. She recalls feeling tired and lethargic in her younger years, when she didnapost exercise at all. As her confidence in the gym improved, she barely spent a day without going to the gym and made sure she worked out just after doing the school run for her grandchildren Maisie,  and Harry, eight. When I first started, I would come home feeling exhausted, she said. Every muscle ached, but as I progressed, my fitness levels improved and I got better. I would never have believed in  years that I would be so hooked on the gym or that I could be this strong.  Due to suffering with osteoarthritis, she uses a wrist splint when lting weights. After her recent break up, Denise even used the gym as a distraction to help herself feel better - and she claims sheaposs now even happier. Denise said: Working out and staying fit stops things from getting me down. Last summer, Denise dipped her toes into HIIT workouts with FORTIS after being invited to a special VIP session at her gym, Spelthorne Leisure Centre. She now uses battle ropes, slam balls, and press machines during her  minute intense workouts and says sheaposs so much stronger.  Denise said: I get such a buzz in there and I feel so impressed with myself because I see those -something yummy mummies and I can give them a run for their money. The nan has had a lust for live since losing her partner Phil in , when he was just  - making Denise realise le is precious. She said: Phil died very young and very quickly. He became ill in February, was diagnosed in March and died on April . No one could believe it. It knocked everybody for six. When Phil died, it made me take stock of my le and I am quite a confident and strong person as a result. Since becoming fitter than sheaposs ever been, Denise reckons sheaposs a better grandmother.  She said: A little boy said to my grandson Harry at school that he wishes his nan was like me, because she just sits in a chair all day, while Iaposm fun. I was very pleased, as Iaposd be devastatedmy grandchildren just thought I sat there doing nothing. I do lots with them. I took them rowing on the Thames the other day and I take them swimming. She also spends her pension on making sure she looks tip top in the gym and has a wardrobe full of workout gear. Denise said: I have  pairs of trainers now, too, because I like to have ones in dferent colours so I can be colour-coordinated. Every day when she does her workouts, Denise meets up with a group of pals who help keep her young. She said: Iaposve made brilliant friends. As soon as I step in the gym, there is banter with the receptionists, the trainers, the cleaner - everyone. They all think Iaposm mad, but in a nice way. For now, Denise is happy being single and fit - and she urged others not to let their fear of the gym stop them from getting in better shape. She said: Iaposd advise other people in later le not to be daunted by the gym. Give it a go, because itaposs just great.

Meanwhile Good Morning Britain pulled several jokes live on air on Friday.Manchester City WFC were tricked into announcing the clubaposs first doggy sports player which they did with gusto before breaking out into laughter. Forward Ellen White delivered her line earnestly welcoming Cityaposs first ever canine sports player and questioned whether to refer to it as a person or a player. This is too much, she added before being convinced to deliver her final line shake paws.  Defender Esme Morgan appeared to react in genuine disbelief when she was told the news. Shut up. Like an agility trial dog  No way, oh my gosh thataposs amazing, she said. This is a player with real pedigree, a teammate said while another added I canapost take this seriously. Have I Got News for You pulled what was perhaps one of the boldest pranks by claiming that the Prime Minister had resigned over the Downing Street lockdown parties. BREAKING: Boris Johnson resigns over partygate, it announced in a tweet which was promptly followed by or has he for April Foolaposs.Good morning Britainaposs Laura Tobin was made to believe she had broken a unique plant named after her in a special breeding programme. The TV presenter looked mortied as she was handed the plant and it smashed on the ground. She then knelt down trying to salvage what was left live on air.  Cutting back to the studio, Kate Garraway and Ben Shephard joined in with the April Foolaposs joke. Supposed plans to use mud from Londonaposs Marble Arch Mound to rebuild Hadrianaposs Wall were announced by Tory MP Mike Wrap as part of levelling up the north. The London Tourism Minister joked: I know Londoners will be bitterly disappointed to be losing this iconic temporary structure that has been compared to the Efel Tower.And police in Australia shared a picture on Facebook of their new Mounted Camel Division as part of an expansion to mounted operations. The state-wide Victoria police force joked: The new one and two hump camels will be a welcome addition to the current herd, helping the organisation address both climate change and fuel price hikes.

Mum Laura Jordan, , from Redditch, Worcs, said her son Zac would not cope in another mainstream school as she believes he has special educational needs. The Mirror previously reported on how Zac had spent more than five months at home following his expulsion, leaving him scared to go outside. Worcestershire County Council now has less than a month to find Lauraaposs son a new school before pupilsfrom the Easter break on April .The local authority previously wanted to put Zac, who recently turned five, into a mainstream school however the council has now performed a U-turn.  Mum-of-two Laura told The Mirror: Zac had an autism assessment on March  and on the back of that the local authority said Zac wonapost be ready for mainstream school yet. I believe he will now be able to go to a special school. Iaposve got a meeting with the local authority on Tuesday, hopefully they will have a school for him by then. I feel that Zacaposs needs have now finally been recognised.As a result of the article and the pressure Iaposm putting on them I hope he will be back in school by April . I said to the local authority that we are running out of time as the kids break up next week. He should already have a place in a school. Progress is definitely being made but I feel itaposs purely because heaposs reached five years old now and the local authority have to prove him with somewhere. Zac was booted out of Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, in October after a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff. Soon afterwards Laura discovered that councils are not required to get kids back into schoolthey are expelled before their fth birthday. The mum previously said: Zac started reception in September and within five weeks he had been permanently excluded.  Ever since heaposs been out of school as he was only four and the compulsory school age is five. Itaposs very rare for this to happen to a child his age. Itaposs pure discrimination, the whole thing. I donapost think itaposs morally right heaposs out of school when people the same age as him are able to go to school.

However, she believes he has autism, ADHD and speech and language problems, which make certain situations aposoverwhelmingapos for him.

But they couldaposve done other things before resorting to excluding him. This wouldaposve involved a possible managed move or alternative provision. Ultimately, they didnapost give him chance or time to adjust to his environment or the new staff in his classroom. She added that the council had requested two special needs schools for Zac, however both said they were full.The mum previously said Zac would have no choice but to attend a mainstream schoolthe council placed him in one, however she fears he would simply be expelled again. Laura said The Mirroraposs article had helped raise awareness about the struggle parents face when fighting for educational support for children with special needs. She thinks the UKaposs compulsory school age should be lowered to four years old so children cannot be expelled and left at home once they have started education. A Department for Education spokesperson previously said: “Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms.“We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision.” Local authorities are responsible for arranging full-time education for excluded pupils once they reach compulsory school age. A spokesman for Worcestershire Children First, which provides education support services on behalf of the county council, said: “Our SEN services are currently working closely with the family to secure the most appropriate education provision for Zac.” Worcestershire County Councilaposs cabinet member for education Marcus Hart previously said: “Parent carers have a statutory right to ask for a particular educational setting and support for their child but it can at times be challenging to find the right place that has capacity and can meet a child’s inidual needs.The law requires all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fth birthday and we are working with Ms Jordan to find a suitable and appropriate school that meets Zac’s assessed needs, ready for him to start school in April. We are sorry that we have been unable to source an educational provision for Zac that has been able to meet his needs for this period and we acknowledge this is unacceptable for Zac, indeed for any child. We are continuing to work alongside Ms Jordan and relevant healthcare providers and partners to ensure that we have a high quality, lawful Educational Health and Care Plan in place for Zac, that will help to ensure he receives the tailored help and support he needs at all stages of his educational journey.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Schools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"man ran life before dying","story":"Man ran for his le before dying in citizens arrest headlock gone wrongChristopher Walters had been spotted running away from New Road Garage, in Longton where an Audi A’s windows had been smashed with a -pound sledgehammerHorried witnesses called  when they saw Christopher Walters, , being held in a ‘tight’ headlock Image: stokesentinelByKathie McInnes:,  Mar |comments A man died after aposrunning for his leapos and being placed under a citizensapos arrest, an inquest heard.Horried witnesses called  when they saw a -year-old male being held in a ‘tight’ headlock as two men tried to perform a citizens’ arrest on him. Minutes earlier, Christopher Walters had been spotted running in Longton where an Audi A’s windows had been smashed with a -pound sledgehammer. Garage boss Jonathan Hassall and mechanic Benjamin Hunt gave chase, following him down a path near Gladstone Primary Academy.An inquest heard today how they tried to restrain him. But what began as a citizens’ arrest turned into tragedy, reports StokeonTrent Live. Mr Walters was lying on the grass verge as Mr Hunt had him in a neck hold. The incident lasted for some minutes and he went into cardiac arrest.He was later pronounced dead at Royal Stoke University Hospital.Following his death, the Independent Office for Police Conductlooked into the time between the first police officer arriving on scene and CPR being started on Mr Walters.  It was established this gap had been one minute and  seconds – a time described by North Staffordshire assistant coroner Sarah Murphy as ‘reasonable’ considering police didn’t have the full facts when they arrived. The events unfolded shortly after lunchtime on May , . The Audi A belonged to the garage and was parked outside when the alarm went off. It was found with several windows smashed. A PE lesson was taking place in the nearby school grounds when Mr Walters was seen running down the path, out of breath and apparently ‘hugging’ the sledgehammer, with the others in pursuit. One witness, Ricky Amos, was driving past when he spotted Mr Walters lying down on the ground. “The others were on top of him,” he recalled in a statement. Mr Hunt had his arms around Mr Walters’ neck. “He had a tight grip of the man’s neck. The man was struggling to worm himself out.” Mr Amos said he saw one of the males holding the sledgehammer in the air before hitting Mr Walters’ legs with it. Another passing driver, Michelle Leese, said in a statement: “I remember just seeing arms everywhere.” She also recalled seeing one of the men pick up the sledgehammer. At that point, she told her daughter, who was also in the car, to call the police. But the use of the hammer was later disputed by Mr Hunt. The -year-old, from Longton, is currently serving a -month sentence in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter last year.  In his basis of plea, he said he deployed a headlock, but claimed neither he nor Mr Hassall had used weapons. Mr Hassall, , sadly took his own le days before he was due to stand trial. Forensic pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar, who carried out the post-mortem, noted injuries to the legs, but no evidence of blunt force trauma. He put the cause of death down to compression of the neck. Tests also showed Mr Walters, of Winchester Avenue, Bentilee, had used cannabis at some point before his death. The initial call to the police related to the vehicle damage. It was only while en route from Stone that an officer got an update about the suspect being restrained by members of the public. Sergeant Anthony McKenzie decided to go and assist in a police riot van. It turned out he was the first officer on scene. He saw Mr Walters being held by Mr Hunt, but said the ‘grip did not appear to be firm’. He told him to release the man. Sgt McKenzie began checking Mr Walters for a pulse. It was at this point that PCSO Toni Foyle was driving past and stopped to help. She said: “Sgt McKenzie shouted to the male, ‘Are you alright, mate’. As he did this, the male’s face moved slightly. I saw his lips were blue and he had grass in his mouth. “I knelt down, putting him in the recovery position. I said, ‘This man needs an ambulance urgently’. I started chest compressions.” Addressing the inquest, Nicola Brooks, the solicitor for Mr Walters’ mother, said there was no evidence he’d shown any aggression towards the men. She added: “He was simply running away. As it turned out, he was running for his le and was cornered in an area of Wood Street, where he was set upon for some  to  minutes.” Concluding the death was due to unlawful killing, Ms Murphy said, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Walters had caused the vehicle damage. But she added: “He didn’t deserve to lose his le.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University HospitalHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mould has been treated numerous times but it’s continuously growing back. They sent in one guy to paint the wall, but that didn’t do anything to help.  Hackney Council responded saying since the last treatment of mould, theyaposve received no further reports.“It’s terrible - I used to be a photographer, and I was outgoing and I could approach people and ask to take photos of them. Now, I don’t talk to people, Nic continued. I don’t go out. And because of the banging and hammeringand smashing about, I don’t sleep.” Nic said there is a rats’ nest next to his property, and that the light fittings in his flatare filled with insects.At the same time he claims to have received persistent threats and abuse from his neighbours, and that some of them often play music at full volume throughout the night. He also says his neighbours have at times urinated outside his front door. Nic’s best friend and carer Tora Peacock, , has been helping him in his fight to be moved somewhere more suitable. and because of Nic’s mental health considerations, she has been contacting Hackney Council to have her friend moved, but to no avail.  “The property isn’t suitable for Nic. Ideally we just want him moved somewhere more suitable for his back and knee issues. Getting him moved is the main priority, but for the most partis not even answering the phone anymore, alleged Tora.She claims that, when trying to reach out to Hackney Council, the response has often been hostile saying she has even been “screamed at” by staff at the councilover the phone on a number of occasions - and has been told “not to complain”.Together, Tora and Nic said they have made over  complaints about his living situation, though Tora has sent over  emails herself asking the council to act. Nic said he has requested to move homes around  times - he claims he was promised to be moved in , then again in , but is still stuck in the same place. Hackney Council’s Strategic Housing Director, Steve Waddington, told MyLondon: “This is an extremely complex situation which we have been working closely for a number of years with [Nic] and his advocate Ms Peacock to resolve. We recognise that there are some aspects of [Nicaposs] complaint that we could have handled better, and we have and are continuing to take steps to remedy this. “Following reports of mould, we carried out a survey of [Nicaposs] home last year and found the issue was being exacerbated by lack of ventilation in the property. We took steps to treat the issue - including installing new fans in the kitchen and bathroom - and have had no further reports of mould since then. We are investigatingany other longer term steps are needed to tackle the issue and have also provided some advice to [Nic] on ways he can also help prevent it occurring. “We have investigated reports made by [Nic] of noise nuisance, including visiting the property and providing noise monitors on several occasions, but so far have been unable to substantiate any evidence of this. However, we will continue to work with [Nic] about his concerns. We have and will continue to work with him around all housing options open to him.” The Mirror has contacted Hackney Council for comment.

Stacy Watkins, , was told she had months to live when she was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cervical cancer, which had already spread to her liver and pelvis, last October. The devastating blow was made even more horric when partner, Dan, , discovered a tumour on his spine, leaving their two children terried. Now, with the mum-of-two crippled by chemo and unable to walk, the family, from Reading, Berkshire have issued an urgent GoFundMe appeal to help them raise £, to fly to Mexico in a last ditch chance at saving her. Dan told The Mirror : This could be her last shot. When she was diagnosed six months ago, they told us that she had aposmonths left to live and more months with treatmentapos so we are on a time limit here. In that time she has taken a real nose e, the chemo is so gruelling on her body that she canapost walk anymore, she can sleep for  hours and still feel tired, and sheaposs in so much pain it can hurt just to hold a glass of water to her lips. Itaposs heart breaking to watch her go through all this because she is the rock of the family she is the one that has kept us strong throughout everything we have already been through. The family have already lived through years of le-threatening illnesses, after both their children, Hayden, , and Tia, , were born with crippling heart defects.  Tia needed a transplant and Hayden needed a pacemaker after they were diagnosed with congenital complete heart blocks - a disruption of the nerve system which regulates the pumping of the heart. More recently, the couple were also helping their own parents battle cancer but had coped thanks to supermum Stacy who has been the rock of the family. But after a routine blood test came back suspicious in October, doctors performed more tests and diagnosed the mum with a neuroendocrine tumour on her cervix. The type of tumour is particularly rare and dangerous because it affects the cells which release essential hormones into the body.  In the weeks following, the family were served a double blow when Danaposs backpain turned out to be a complicated tumour on his spine, for which he is still awaiting biopsy results to seeit is benign or cancerous. Speaking to The Mirror after launching their appeal last month, Dan said: “It’s literally been a whirlwind of a le, it’s coming at us from every single angle. “One of these things to happen in a letime is bad enough but all of the things happening at the same time, it’s like living in your own horror movie. Now the family have found a promising alternative treatment plan at the Hope  Cancer clinic in Mexico, where Dan says medics have already had success with Stacyaposs type of cancer.The £, target would pay for her flights, accommodation, immunotherapy, supplements andvisits for check ups. He added: It would mean everything to give Stacey this chance to live longer. All the kids want is their mum back and itaposs so frustrating that I canapost give them any certainty, As a family we have never asked for anything, we have just got one with it but now we are begging anyone and everyone to help us do everything we can to save Stacy.To donate to Stacyaposs GoFundMe click hereRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cervical cancerCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Smile and wave, he says, standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal, the corners of his mouth slowly slipping. Why isnapost everybody cheering for the white man  Will thinks.Yes, the monarchy benefitted from slavery. Yes, protestors are calling for reparations. Yes, Iaposm completely out of touch but I got up on stage and declared slavery should NEVER have happened.

Safe to say, the standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal deserved the backlash it created. But from it, talk about the royalsapos hard work ethic and dedication to duty also arose. Itaposs the perfect smokescreen to move on from the controversy something the royals have had plenty of practice with. But in doing so, they stick their fingers up at the public once again, and dig themselves an even bigger hole. Will certainly takes after Daddy, Prince Charles, who is impatiently twiddling his thumbs for his five minutes of being King.  The Prince of Wales was crowned the hardest working Royal back in  - after completing  engagements.

It has now been reported that, despite marrying and Claire taking her husbandaposs name, the couple are now living separately from each other in dferent homes in Glasgow, although it is understood they still see each other, according to Mail Online. The disastrous end to their wedding three years ago happened after hours of heavy drinking, leading to a fight breaking out, the Mirror reported yesterday.Claire, a mother to four children, grabbed her own mum, Cherry-Ann Lindsay, , by the hair before hitting her with a stiletto. She also put her hands around her mumaposs throat.  Ms Lindsay told the Mail: She then grabbed me and put me in a choke hold. I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die. Neighbours told how the married couple are living apart in the Scottish city. A neighbour said: They don’t live together no. They’re at separate addresses a few miles apart and have been for a while. But they do still visit each other so it’s not clear what the state of the relationship is. Claire attacked her mum and her mumaposs partner -year-old David Boyd, at which time Eamonn, a former professional boxer, and his brother Kieran joined in. David was punched, kicked, bitten and grabbed at the neck by the two brothers. They also pushed their thumbs into his eyes.  Kieran Goodbrand also punched and kicked Garry Brown, another guest at the wedding. Wedding day photos show the newly married couple beaming with happiness on the dance floor and standing for photos by water. Police were called to wedding venue The Vu at Ballencrieff Toll, Bathgate, in West Lothian after the fight, which spilled onto the lawn, was reportedly caught on CCTV. The bride, groom and best man were all arrested and held in custody that night. The couple plus their best man, who are all from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty to assault and injury charges at Livingston Sherf Court this week. Claire Goodbrand pleaded guilty on indictment to assault to injury but not guilty to a more serious assault to severe injury.  She admitted repeatedly seizing her mother by the hair, punching and kicking her on the head and body, causing her to fall to the ground, before striking her head at The Vue wedding venue at Ballencrieff Toll in West Lothian’s Bathgate Hills. She also admitted punching and kicking her mum Cherry-Ann to the head and body whilst she was on the ground, striking her on the head with a shoe and seizing her by the neck and restricting her breathing. Eamonn and Kieran both pled guilty to repeatedly punching and kicking David Boyd on the head and body while acting together. The charge states that they caused him to fall to the ground and continued their violent attack as he lay there. They admitted pushing their thumbs into Mr Boyd’s eyes, biting him on the head and body and repeatedly seizing him by the neck and restricting his breathing, all to his severe injury.In addition, Kieran Goodbrand admitted assaulting Garry Brown by punching and kicking him on the head and body to his injury at the reception on  June . A fourth member of the family, -year-old Brendan Goodbrand, had his not guilty pleas to two assault charges accepted by the Crown after his alibi that he had left the venue before trouble broke out turned out to be true. Sherf Martin Edington called for criminal justice social work reports on all three accused before passing sentence. He adjourned the case until  April for information on possible disposals, including social work supervision, unpaid hours of work and restriction of liberty by electronic curfew.Eamonn Goodbrand’s Facebook page reveals that he works as a professional fighter, boxing competitively as a light middleweight.It was reported after the wedding reception that one of the alleged victims lost part of a finger during the attack. The prosecution will narrate the full circumstances when the case calls for sentence. Ms Lindsay said, to her, the wedding day felt like a sick joke. She said her daughter was swearing like a banshee and the boys were drinking beer and falling over each other. She said she began to sense trouble brewing but didnapost expect it to escalate so much. The -year-old said she has moved away to an undisclosed address and does not want to see them anymore.

She claims Mr Turk tricked her into giving Andrew £, by way of payment for assistance with getting a passport, the court heard. The judge was told that substantial sums had been paid to Andrew and his we. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on their part. Andrew has since repaid the cash after she alleged it was a scam, Mail Online reports.Mrs Isbilen has alleged that Mr Turk breached fiduciary obligations he owed to her and advances claims in deceit. She claims he dishonestly misappropriated millionof her money, the High Court heard. Mr Turk is fighting the case. The litigation is ongoing and has been heard at the High Court in London. A number of preliminary rulings have been published. Judge Halpern said a lawyer representing Mrs Isbilen had told him, in an affidavit, that information had emerged to show evidence given by Mr Turk was misleading.  He said solicitor Jonathan Tickner had told him how evidence showed that money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen, e.g., substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York. Judge Halpern said barrister Dan McCourt Fritz, who represents Mrs Isbilen, had told him that the total sums which his client claims were misappropriated amounted to some  million US dollars . Mr Turk has provided explanations for approximately two thirds of these sums, most of which have been allegedly spent on professional or other fees or lost in bad investments, the judge added, in his ruling. No explanation at all has been given for the remaining one third.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him.

Maya Gibbon, who was a science teacher, has been left mostly unable to get out of bed after catching the virusMaya Gibbon has been struggling to adjust to le with a chronic health conditionByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Mar |comments Maya Gibbon was a busy science teacher at a Brighton secondary school two years ago. Since ­contracting Covid in the classroom, she has been mostly unable to get out of bed, struggling to adjust to le with a chronic health condition.Unable to work, and with her husband now acting as her full-time carer, the couple were forced to live in a van for five months last year and are now facing homelessness again. “This week is my two-year Covid ­anniversary and I honestly feel like the person I was died two years ago,” Maya says. “I have stopped doing practically everything I did before.”Antony Loveless and his partner Claire caught the virus in January  and have never recovered. At times, it has affected the couple so badly that Antony has even contemplated taking his own le. “We had professional lives, we worked - hours a day, then came home, cooked dinner, did chores, we volunteered,” he says. “Now I struggle to make toast. Our le is in these four walls. We can’t even use our car because we can’t walk the few feet to get to it.” Saskia Mulder, , a deputy ward sister, living in Derry, Northern Ireland, caught Covid after caring for positive patients in March . She also says she has felt suicidal at times. “I thought I’d be better after a few weeks,” she says. “Two years on I’m still off work, using a stick and have cognitive problems. I’m nowhere near the person I was, my mental health has suffered so much. I’m a strong person, but it’s taken everything.” We are now told we must “live with” Covid. Yet for . million people with Long Covid, le over the last two years has changed unrecognisably – with very little support. Many of these people were key workers who had to work while the rest of Britain kept safe. Many in the public sector were betrayed by the Government’s failure on PPE. Yet, like the Covid bereaved, these people are now in danger of being forgotten by a government in whose interests it is to move on as quickly as possible from the virus.Today, in a moving debate called in Parliament, Layla Moran MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, told those with Long Covid: “We hear you. You have not been forgotten. And we continue to fight for you.” As well as a public health emergency, Moran warned of a “looming crisis ahead” for the economy with .% of the population affected. “Public sector workers gave their lives,” she said. “When we were all allowed to be at home, they went in, and, according to the Office for National Statistics, are the ones who have the highest prevalence of Long Covid. I do believe we owe them so much more.”Labour MP Debbie Abrahams spoke about her own experience of Long Covid, including “prolonged fatigue and nasty bouts of nausea,” as well as “worsened arthritis, pain that is sometimes completely debilitating”.She raised the plight of , children with Long Covid as well as that of frontline workers and people in deprived communities more associated with the condition. “This Covid pandemic is far from over,” she told the House.The APPG reports that the UK government has “continuously failed” to take Long Covid into account and has not “adequately funded” research into treatment. Antony Loveless goes further. “They have blood on their hands,” he says. “They are wilfully ignoring it. I had to sit and listen to Rishi Sunak talking about writing off £.billion of fraudulent business loans when there’s only £million put forward to Long Covid support. It’s loose change to them, isn’t it ”While Downing Street partied, Maya Gibbon has been living a new le of chronic illness and hospital appointments. She has had four hospital admissions, two operations, more than  blood tests, eight MRIs,  CT scans, two lumbar punctures,  ultrasounds, one colonoscopy, and multiple ECGs. She’s had thunderclap headaches that make her black out, and kidney stones caused by her medication. She can count the number of walks she has taken on the fingers of her hands.“I miss work so much,” she says. “And I am absolutely filled with dread about all the cost of living increases coming.” Saskia Mulder says her experience has opened her eyes “to the way people with health conditions are treated. I always saw it as the nurse, now it’s as a patient. At one point I was suicidal… I do want to go back to work becauseyou don’t have hope, what have you got  But a lot of nurses are being told to retire on grounds of ill health.”Antony’s partner Claire, , is too exhausted to speak to us. She is about to have her contract with the NHS terminated, after being off sick for the last  months.Antony, , an author and a former investigator at the London Gateway Port lost his own job last year. “We had savings, but they went,” he says. “Now we’re surviving on benefits. I’ve lost four stone and Claire has lost six-and-a-half stone. We’re disabled now and it’s been a struggle to accept that.” Last year, Antony planned to take his own le. “I hit rock bottom last summer,” he says. “I said to Claire, ‘I’ve got nothing left. I want to end my le’.” He says support from community groups and counselling saved him. Maya looks back over the last two years. “I wish I would have known that it would have been so isive,” she says. “That people would have denied it existed, denied it was bad and laughed at the thing that had changed your le. “I wish that I would have known that the country would have listened to politicians as opposed to scientists and doctors of infectious diseases.” Saskia Mulder has a question for the Government. “They clapped for us when we were on the front line, but now what ” she asks.

Parts of the country woke up to snow on Thursday, with cautious forecasts of a small amount of flakes surpassed for those in the east of the country where several inches had settled. The frosty turn, which is being powered by a blast of air from the Arctic, comes a week after the start of Spring and a run of unusually warm temperatures, blue sky and sunshine. While temperatures may not quite be getting back to the C that graced parts of the UK just days ago, forecasters say temperatures will be back in the double digits soon enough.Speaking to The Mirror, Met Office Meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said the warm temperatures over recent days were something of a “ start” to the new season. “The temperatures we saw last week were well above the average temperature for late March across the UK,” she said. “So it may have felt like summer for some but in fact it is still early spring when the average temperature is around  or  C in the UK.” Cold arctic air has brought colder temperatures, which would stick around over the weekend, Ms Shuttleworth said. Temperatures overnight on Thursday were due to settle just a few degrees above zero for most areas, with Cpredicted for London and Edinburgh. Devon and Cornwall are set to see the warmest temperature of C, with the coolest of C forecast for Aberdeenshire and North Yorkshire. This follows last weekaposs sunshine when the mercury hit C in some places. Weekend temperatures are predicted to remain in the single figures too. The mercury is forecast to reach highs of C and C across the UK on Friday and Saturday, increasing to C and C on Sunday. Sunny spells with some cloud are predicted for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, with a largely cloudy day all round on Sunday.  Meteorologist Matty Box said there is a cold air mass over the UK. There is an ice warning out at the moment, he said. If thereaposs any melting and refreezing overnight then thereaposs an ice risk. I suspect there will be a similar risk for Thursday night to Friday morning.Discussing Fridayaposs weather, he added: It will be concentrated and there will be snow showers.It will be eastern and northern areas of the UK that are more likely to see any showers of rain, sleet or snow.  The weather will then improve over the weekend, with some sunny spells. Showers will become less frequent, but still with the chance of some wintry showers in the east coast and the North Sea coast in particular through Saturday, Mr Box said. There should be a fair amount of sunshine as well. In Canterbury, Kent, snow saw a county cricket warm-up match between Lancashire and Kent suspended and then cancelled on Thursday. A wind change to more of a westerly direction next week would bring temperatures back to double figures for many - though many would see a healthy dousing of rain as well. And Ms Shuttleworth said it looks as though we will see temperatures at or above average throughout the month of April. However, Spring was often a changeable month temperature wise, Ms Shuttleworth noted, “as our seas are still cold after the winter but the sun is getting stronger and the days longer”. “The temperatures can y a lot depending on the wind direction,” she said.

One woman now feels guilty after her boyfriend, Mike, overheard her making fun of his love of dopey scented candlesduring a phone call with a friend.The -year-old woman had no idea that he was in earshot at the time, and, given how he reacted, sheaposs worried that she might have taken her joke too far. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the concerned girlfriend wrote: Mike has some interests that some might typically consider girly butthey make him happy I’m all for it.I like doing knitting and stuff like that and he’ll always askhe can do it with me and I’ll say yes and show him how to do it and he’s always super interested and wants to learn and stuff like that. She continued: Anyway, recently Mikeaposs gotten really into scented candles. I just think it’s kind of funny how into them he is because they’re kind of lame. But anyway, right before he left I was on the phone with my friend and said aposyeah Mikeaposs going to get those dopey scented candlesapos. He was in earshot and I didn’t realise. He got offended and left looking super upset. I texted him but he said he didn’t wanna talk because he thinks I was being mean. Although she believes that Mike, , is being oversensitive about the whole situation, she is now worried that she missed the mark somewhat with her joke. One fellow Reddit user advised: Dude youaposve got yourself a good boyfriend, the kind that wants to engage in your hobbies and does their own crafty stuff, and you decided to belittle him  Please don’t, don’t call his hobbies girly, respect the man and drop your bulls**t aposthis is not for menapos. People thinking like that is what gave us toxic masculinity. Stop propagating it to the few that actually want to express themselves. He’s too good for you. Another wrote: This man is taking interest in things that are against the social norm and is probably really self-conscious about it. You were the person he thought had his back and then you go and make jokes to your friends. Of course, heaposs hurt. Apologise and get this man a nice Yankee candle and hope he forgives you and maybe someday heaposll trust you enough to start sharing his interest in things again.Do you have a relationship-related story to tell  We pay for stories.

And now he has revealed how to perfectly prepare your sausages in five easy-to-follow steps.With more than three decades of experience working in a professional kitchen as an award-winning Michelin-starred chef, Jeff knows his stuff, says the Daily Star, so take note.Heaposs even shared some of the most common errors home cooks make - and pricking the sausages is a big no-no. For the perfect sausages, Jeff recommends cooking them as follows: For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. . Remove the sausages from the fridge  minutes before cooking. This helps the sausage to cook evenly and prevents the skin from splitting when it hits the heat. . Pop them into a heavy-based non-stick frying pan and place them on low to medium heat. . Add a teaspoon of duck or goose fat to the pan and swirl it around until the base is fully coated. Then tip away any excess fat. . Place the sausages in the pan, making sure they’re not touching each other and keep on constant heat. Turning them regularly ensures the bangers get a rich golden colour. Jeff recommends  to  minutes for a traditional thick sausage. . Rest the sausages before serving. Once the sausages are cooked, they will be firm to touch, with an internal temperature of °C. The secret now is to let the sausages rest for a few minutes, just like you would a steak allowing the meat to relax, giving you a tender, juicy sausage. Common mistakes Jeff also shared some of the most common mistakes people make when cooking sausages.The first is pricking the skins when cooking the sausages. This causes the juice to run out, meaning youaposll be left with a dry, tasteless sausage. He also urges people never to deep fry their sausages as this can also dry them out. And finally, baking your sausages - although this may seem like the healthiest option - doing so prevents the exterior from crisping up.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

St Duthac is the patron saint of Tain and amongst the guests last year was local writer, Helen Sedgwick, whose novels are set in Burrowhead.When not listening to readings or admiring the work of the thriving arts community, visitors can raise a glass at nearby Glenmorangie Distillery, explore expansive Dornoch beach and discover the vast area of mudflats, saltmarsh and wet grassland that make up the RSPB’s Nigg reserve. stduthacbookfestBloody Scotland -  SeptemberFrom the battlements of Stirling Castle the view extends westwards to Ben Lomond and east towards the trio of bridges that guard the northern approach to Edinburgh, while beneath the battlements the River Forth heads for the North Sea in a series of lazy curves. Scotland’s international crime writing festival, which is based in Stirling, celebrates its th anniversary this year and away from the lecture rooms there are military and royal sites to explore and history to be uncovered in the cobbled streets that crowd around the castle. bloodyscotlandWrite Highland Hoolie- NovemberMallaig launched its first book festival last year, when broadcaster and author Sally Magnusson and poet, Jackie Kay, were amongst the writers who followed the ‘Road to the Isles’ as far as this west coast fishing port, which sits close to some of the best beaches in Scotland. Another way to reach the festival is by train, crossing the spectacular Glenfinnan Viaduct.

It runs to more than we will ever know.Jane Lax, Aberlour.BIGGER SHAMBLES AT WESTMINSTERBRIAN Chrystalwrites that “the incompetenceof some parts of the Westminster Government is undeniable but so is the case of the ferries” and for good measure and emphasis, “other aspects of delivering public services”.The previous day, John Shanksmade much the same point when he claimed that “faced with examples of SNP incompetence at Holyrood” independence supporters typically point to “something the Conservatives at Westminster did wrong”.However, both miss the critical point of scale. The ferries fiasco – and that is the correct description, for it is a fiasco – has to date a cost overrun of £ million, but that is expected to rise before the ships see service. So, lets put a contingency of another  per cent on, so £m. Not a project to put at the top – or anywhere near – your CV.However, as both Messrs Crystal and Shanks have mentioned Westminster, let’s look at a couple of instances from there.First up is that some % of PPE contracts, awarded between the beginning of the pandemic and November , have been identied as possibly corrupt, at a cost to the taxpayer estimated at £. billion.Second is that £.bn has just been written off by HM Treasury for fraudulent loans made during the height of the Covid epidemic. In addition it is estimated that loans that will have to be written off business cannot repay could amount to anything up to £bn.All in all, just these two shambles have cost the UK taxpayer anything up to £bn. The ferry fiasco has cost .% of that.No, the ferry fiasco is not something to be praised, but then again, the above considerations do appear to confirm that Westminster does do at least one thing better than Holyrood.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.TOXIC CULTURE BLAME LIES WITH SNPTHE First Minister is correct in saying that our political culture is more toxic now. I would also agree about the role of social media, which is akin to an unconstructive digital chasm .However, surely some blame for this must lie at her own partys door. Before  I was largely comfortable in my identity I was Scottish and British. I expect many felt the same, moving along a continuum. In  it was open to attack for the first time. Was I Scottish enough  How Scottish did I need to be  Was I \"quisling\" for wanting to vote No The SNP has used every election, local and national to campaign for another independence referendum where not only your political views are questioned, but your sense of identity as well. The opposition parties dutully and necessarily have to follow suit with this.Nicola Sturgeon has the power to put the clock back to the post- world, yet obviously chooses to exist in this \"polarised and toxic\" Scotland that she bemoans.David Bone, Girvan.FREEBIES HAVE TO BE PAID FORRUTH Marragain gushes about all the \"free\" goodies her wonderful SNP Government provides ­– the usual suspects of baby boxes, prescription charges, university education, personal care and on and on.As I have pointed out before, the obvious flaw in her argument is that all these \"free\" things are actually paid for from our taxes and of course income tax here in Scotland is the highest in the whole of the UK.Ms Marr then provides another open goal by raising the Borders Railway, soon to be run by the Scottish Government, whose record with Prestwick Airport, Ferguson Marine et al speaks for itself. What could possibly go wrong James Martin, Bearsden.SCOTS SHOCKING DEAL ON ENERGYTHIS April, every household in the Irish Republic will have £ automatically credited to their domestic electricity accounts while businesses and domestic consumers in Scotland will be suffering even higher bills than their English counterparts thanks to the UK’s energy policies.The daily standing charge set by the UK Government-influenced body Ofgem is going up by  per cent in parts of Scotland to p or p while in London consumers will pay just p per day. Part of the hike will go to fill the hole left by the collapse of energy firms taxpayers are already on the hook for the £ billion bail-out of Bulb energy.Scotland’s consumers also suffer from the discriminatory National Grid charges set by Ofgem whereby our renewables industries pay the highest connection charges in Europe at £. per megawatt hour, which is more than double that of our nearest competitors in Yorkshire and Humberside which have attracted most of the recent investment.Astonishingly, Norway can feed energy into our National Grid at a cost of £. per megawatt hour. France pays p per megawatt hour while Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg pay nothing to feed into our grid.To make matters worse, the National Grid sold a % stake in Britain’s gas pipeline infrastructure to Australian investment firms for more than £bn. They will be looking to increase profits from UK consumers.As energy is reserved to Westminster, there is little chance of things improving prior to independence.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* IN February  Scottish Power CEO Keith Anderson said energy prices would fall “in a few years” due to the expansion of renewables. However, in his article on renewables todayhe doesnt mention cost.My per-unit price for electricity has just risen from p to p overnight, and the daily charge has gone up from p to p. In what year will our bills come down, Mr Anderson Geoff Moore, Alness.WHEN WILL NORTH BE ON TRACK THANK you for today’s essays on Scotland’s future railways . All three contributors made many interesting suggestions, but with little reference to the need to properly connect Inverness and Aberdeen.The billions spent on “creating a genuinely world class railway system across central Scotland” [Iain Docherty] and the introduction of Scotland’s InterCity trains to “offer competitive journey times on most routes” [John McCormick] are really welcome. However, this still leaves the cities of Perth, Inverness and Aberdeen out in the cold for journey times and line capacity. As far back as April , the CEO of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce observed that “single-track sections of the railways linking Inverness, Aberdeen and the Central Belt are unacceptable in the st century.”Talk of a “three-hour London-Glasgow Edinburgh rail journey target time” is surely premature when this same target set for Inverness-Glasgow Edinburgh by the then First Minister in August  for completion by  is nowhere near being achieved. Indeed the Edinburgh-Inverness average journey time looks set to increase by another few minutes to three hours  minutes with the May  timetable.Three hours by rail was Priority  in the  Strategic Transport Projects Reviewto follow the Queensferry Crossing and the Edinburgh-Glasgow Rail Improvement Projects , both of which were completed long ago.

The selection of womenswear was designed in collaboration with over , women over the last two months to ensure no waste was created in the process.The pop-up aimed to allow shoppers to view, try on and buy from the limited edition collection as well as learning about the industry changes shopping with This is Unfolded is driving.There was no checkout because customers have to wait four to six weeks for their garment to be made, however, each purchase also supports a child in education. The company runs an Unfolded impact program to support children in India.Cally Russell, co-founder and CEO of This is Unfolded said the company aims to show there is a dferent way for the industry to operate.“The fashion industry is notoriously bad for the environment with % of new clothes made never being sold,” he explained. The aim behind This is Unfolded is to make sustainable clothing collections at an affordable price point.CEO Cally Russell “We know from our own research that more and more people want to buy sustainably but that often the cost can be prohibitive. With This is Unfolded we are building a completely new retail model, one that delivers sustainable and affordable clothes and avoids waste and overproduction. We then use the savings that this approach allows, to pay garment workers better wages and to create long term impact in manufacturing communities through funding children’s education.”Nothing in the collection costs more than £ and yet the garment workers are paid a living wage.“This is Unfolded removes this waste from the production and sales process to deliver truly sustainable clothing collections. The savings made are then used to improve lives – by paying workers better and creating long term change by supporting children in India in education,” Russell added.In  the company launched three collections and grew to thousands of customers across the UK – supporting over , children in education for  months through their innovative approach.The team behind This is Unfolded has a history of creating impact in the fashion industry, having established clothing initiative Lost Stock during the pandemic.It was set up to support garment workers as fashion retailers cancelled billions of pounds worth of stock orders due to the lockdown forcing the closure of stores. It left factories in countries like Bangladesh with unwanted new clothes and no way to pay their workers.Lost Stock sold this stock to consumers as ‘mystery clothing boxes’ to fund support for over , workers and their families for a month each.The success of the initiative made the team want to create something more permanent.“This is Unfolded offers capsule collections of affordable, sustainably-made clothes,” Russell said. “This new way to produce and sell clothes is powered by data, community and a factory to consumer model. Clothes are only produced once orders are placed, removing overstock and ensuring demand is matched to production.“We have just launched our fourth collection designed in collaboration with our co-creator community of over  customers who have provided feedback on styles, prints, fit and much more throughout the design process. Clothes are then only produced when orders are placed so as to avoid any overproduction.”As well as creating a new production and consumer model, the company also supports children’s education in India, through its charity partner Pratham.“We are currently funding the education of  children in India for the next year and with collection four we hope to add another  children to this,” Russell said.“So we offer clothes that not only look great but that are better for the environment, the workers and society – in order to do this all we ask of our customers is that they wait four to six weeks for delivery.”www.thisisunfolded  "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-modellers-caution-uncertainty-virus-trends-months-ahead","story":"Modelling carried out for the Scottish Government sets out five “possible futures” ranging from a reduction in infections to “very low levels” within the coming months to a scenario in which a new more virulent strain emerges and overtakes Omicron, leading to hospital occupancy “rising well above capacity restrictions”.The Modelling the Epidemic report states: “The timing is uncertain but has currently been lined up with the summer holidays where reduced travel restrictions may make it more likely that a new iant is brought into Scotland.”: Scots self-funding private hospital treatment up  per cent The authors stress that these are “plausible scenarios” but “should not be considered predictions”, adding: “It is dficult to ascertain which of these scenarios may be the more likely and in reality the situation is likely to move from one to the other and not in a linear fashion.”It comes amid uncertainty over whether Scotland’s virus rates are increasing, decreasing, or levelling off.The Office for National Statistics estimates from its surveillance that one in  people in Scotland had Covid in the week ending March , down from one in  the previous week, but said the “trend was uncertain”.Wastewater monitoring in Scotland detected an increase in virus levels of nearly % in the week ending March , compared to the previous seven days.The number of people in hospital with Covid rose to , - equalling the previous record set on Tuesday, and reversing previous signs of a decline.Mass testing for the general population in Scotland will be wound down from April , the same date that facemasks are due to become guidance rather than law.The Modelling the Epidemic report outlines five possible scenarios for the months ahead.One envisions Omicron remaining dominant, with vaccines and natural immunity holding up so that “infections may decrease from current levels over the coming weeks and months to very low levels”. Covid becomes endemic and cases “spring up only as rare outbreaks”.In a second scenario, waning immunity and “the increasing reluctance of people in Scotland to keep being boosted\" erodes population protection.: Why is Covid still wrecking the NHS - and where do we go from here The number of people requiring medical treatment or hospitalisation for Covid “rises particularly in vulnerable older age groups”, the NHS finds it harder to focus on recovery, and society “becomes segmented” as those at highest risk “lead restricted lives or accept signicant risk of serious illness” while “the rest of the population live a more normal le accepting the possibility of infection with mild illness”.A third scenario also describes a society “polarised as some continue to take up vaccines and follow guidance while others are more reluctant”.Covid cases “spring up and are hard to control in those who are not vaccinated or vulnerable” and “the very elderly and immune compromised are at risk from infection from those not vaccinated or boosted”.The scenarios range from Immune World where infections and hospitalisations fall to very low levels through summer, and a scenario where summer holidays result in the spread of a dangerous new iant leading to very high hospital demand The final two scenarios involve iants.In the first, a iant with increased transmission but not increased severity emerges resulting in a scenario “similar to what has happened in Scotland with the emergence of Omicron”.In the final scenario “a new iant appears in Scotland as peoplefrom their summer holidays andto work and school”. This has similar transmissibility and immune escape to Omicron, but replaces it and also causes more severe disease than the previous Delta strain.The report adds: “It could lead to high levels of infections leading to hospital occupancy rising well above capacity restrictions. With sustained high levels of infection we could again see increased staff absences in a number of sectors that were affected by this in the recent Omicron wave.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

I don’t want to rule anything out. I’m currently employed here at Ajax to perform. With the cup final against Eindhoven, we still have eight finals left, and I need all my energy for that.“Anything  would just be a distraction. I know that everything in football can change from one day to the next. If at some point I should decide to take the next step, I hope that people here will understand.”And asked to confirm or deny speaking to United, Ten Hag added: “Everyone knows each other in the industry. There are always talks with representatives from other clubs, that’s normal.“Manchester United is a great club with great fans. But I can only repeat myself. My full focus is completely on Ajax. We are already planning for the new season.“I’ve sat down with Ajax after every season so far. That will also be the case this time.

It is clear we would like to continue with Christian.”Brentford goalkeeper David Raya also enjoyed a memorable international week after he received a maiden call-up to the Spanish national team and was handed a debut in Saturday’s - win over Albania.The Barcelona-born stopper never represented his country at youth level but has enjoyed an excellent rise since he first signed for the west London club in .Frank insisted: “It was huge. I think for a football club of our size and the way we progressed through the leagues to now being in the Premier League, that we can have a player in the Spanish national team getting his debut, it is close to unbelievable.“It is really, really big and shows you can play for Brentford and get a debut with one of the biggest national teams or countries in the world.”Raya’s focus will now turn to taking on Champions League holders Cha.The Blues have faced uncertainty during the last month after owner Roman Abramovich announced plans to sell the club in March before sanctions were brought against the Russian-Israeli billionaire by the UK Government that forced the club to obtain a special license to continue operating.“They are Champions League winners and they can win it again so we are up against world-class players. If we go there and win, it would be the result of the season for us probably,” Frank said.“I really hope that we perform well and get a result because we have been close against the top six clubs.“I know it will be unbelievably dficult going to Stamford Bridge against a top Cha side. Thomas Tuchel and his staff have done an unbelievably tough job in very dficult circumstances recently of course but we believe we can get a result.”"},{"url":null,"title":"channel-5-apologises-vulnerable-pensioner-cant-pay-take-away  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

Tonight we are still looking at a mixture of showers and clear spells,” she said.Initially,you’re near the north coast that’s where you’re most likely to encounter the showers and some cloudier skies.“However, the further south you are it’s more likely you’ll get some clear spells. It’s certainly worth a shotpeople are going out this evening around -pm.”Conditions for catching the Northern Lights will also be more dficult in urban areas like Belfast.You do need the clear skies, so ideally you would want the northern horizon which is clear from light pollution.You could still head out to the north coast, and while likely to get a few showers in between them it’s where you’re going to get the darkest horizon.It’s a little bit of a Catch  there.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatCriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual bills PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idle PremiumRepublic of Ireland should maintain its military neutrality, say three quarters of Sinn Fein votersMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayTyrone suffer further blow as another player walks away ahead of Ulster Championship campaignTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayTyrone suffer further blow as another player walks away ahead of Ulster Championship campaignTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSDLP MP Claire Hanna has spoken of her shock at a Sinn Fein proposal to abolish the constituency of South Belfast.In a submission to the Boundary Commission, the party proposes the constituency is axed with its voters largely ided between two other constituencies — despite South Belfast having more voters than either East or West Belfast.Ms Hanna said Sinn Fein’s proposal “does not make any mathematical sense” and that residents would be stunned it was seeking to abolish Northern Ireland’s most politically erse constituency.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.South Belfast currently is the only constituency toMLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens.Ms Hanna said: “Each of Belfast’s four constituencies has a distinct identity, community cohesion, and things they are proud of. South Belfast has for decades been known as a erse, integrated part of the city where people of all political views and none live side-by-side.“Many people chose to settle in South Belfast precisely because of that. This constituency is, and always has been, a shared space.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It is pluralist in its politics and values, and I think residents would be very disconcerted and concerned at a proposal to break it up and to parcel bits off into other constituencies.”Read MoreTalks need to begin over scrapping mandatory coalition, says Arlene FosterThe rules for the  Boundary Commission review mean each constituency must have an electorate of between , and ,.North Belfastand South Belfastfall within the target range. West Belfastand East Belfastdo not.Ms Hanna lodged her objections to Sinn Fein’s proposal at a meeting with the Boundary Commission last month.“West and East Belfast are below the statutory electoral range by , and , voters respectively,” she said.“The high level of house-building in South Belfast, particularly in the Four Winds and Malone, together with the council’s determination to repopulate the city core, means the number of electors in South Belfast is going to rise further within a parliamentary term.“The Boundary Commission was happy for Northern Ireland to keep all its  seats. In previous proposals in , which were dropped, it had wanted to reduce to  seats, so somewhere would have had to take the fall.“Sinn Fein’s proposal is even more surprising when the Boundary Commission isn’t even looking to lose a seat.”Under Sinn Fein’s plan, Belfast would be reduced from four constituencies to three.East Belfast would remain, absorbing parts of South Belfast, and two new constituencies would be created — North West Belfast and South West Belfast.Ormeau, Rosetta, and Ravenhill would be moved into East Belfast. Malone, Stranmillis, and Finaghy would be put into the new South West Belfast constituency.Demographic trends suggest Sinn Fein would secure both the South West and North West Belfast seats at a Westminster election, with the SDLP losing out. The influx of South Belfast voters to the east of the city would help Alliance unseat the DUP there.In its submission to the Boundary Commission, Michelle O’Neill’s party says: “Sinn Fein believe that too much emphasis is placed in trying to keep Belfast as four-seater constituency which comes at the detriment to the rest of the constituencies.”Under the Boundary Commission’s plan, South Belfast remains largely intact, but gains the rural wards of Drumbo, Saintfield, and Moneyreagh to become South Belfast and Mid Down. Strangford would be renamed Strangford and Quoile.Professor Jon Tonge of the University of Liverpool said the commission’s proposed boundary changes were “fairly minimalist”.“Fermanagh and South Tyrone — very marginal — becomes fractionally more nationalist, which will please Sinn Fein. Foyle becomes a bit more nationalist, and East Londonderry a bit more unionist,” he said.Related topicsClaire HannaSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyGreen PartyMore On Claire HannaSir Jeffrey Donaldson and Doug Beattie to share stage on youth mental health issues this weekendNorthern Ireland could be set to welcome Ukrainian refugees under new Home Office visa scheme PremiumJon TongeOpinionSDLP and Sinn Fein could swap unity manestos and no one would notice PremiumSDLP’s Colum Eastwood: ‘SF are focused on themselves and on securing jobs for their friends’Ian Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayTyrone suffer further blow as another player walks away ahead of Ulster Championship campaignTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Press Eye Darren Kidd“No, we did not get everything right,” she told the audience, adding that decisions made had an impact they did not foresee.She highlighted the impact on vulnerable children kept away from school and elderly people who spent the last weeks of their lives in isolation.More broadly,some political leaders pushed back against specic advice “that was somehow endangering health and more interested in wealth”.“It was really, really unhelpful,” Mrs Foster said. “In a one-party governmentwould have been struggling but we were in a five-party coalition.” She added that some in the Executive wanted everything shut down while she advocated what she claims was a more common sense approach.“But we had to find common ground,” Mrs Foster added.On the argument made by some in the business community the region will be in a unique position with a foot in both the EU and GB, Mrs Foster said in the interview with thethat she does not agree with that point of view.She said: “No, I do not. First of all because we are part of the United Kingdom, most of our supply chain is from the UK. If you look at people who rely on goods coming — whether it is manufacturing or retail — they have to get the goods from GB into Northern Ireland and sometimes go back to GB again.“The problem is from GB to Northern Ireland and, therefore, that has to be fixed.”Mrs Foster further argued: “Economics are very important and I have always been interested in the economy of Northern Ireland...but societally this is causing real problems in Northern Ireland because people feel that their identity as citizens is being eroded.“That goes way beyond economic issues. That is a problem and therefore needs to be sorted.“You cannot separate the economy from the societal issues.” Questioned on whether other issues facing both the UK government and the EU, including the Ukraine crisis, may hold up thrashing out a deal that would essentially remove those barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, Mrs Foster said: “I would have thought the Ukraine would have pointed to a need to actually sort out these issues more so than anything .” She added: “In the sense thatyou have a sovereign country that has been invaded as you have in the Ukraine, does that not say Boris Johnson as Prime Minister should look to his sovereign borders as well and deal with the issues that are there “Yes, to me he should be dealing with the issues within his own jurisdiction.”On the Protocol protests, Mrs Foster said she will leave those to the politicians but that she has not attended any rallies — and has not been invited.The former Fermanagh-South Tyrone MLA does not believe the Executive will be up and running in the immediate aftermath of the election but that should not impact business to any great extent.“Businesses are making their decisions not on what is happening at Stormont, quite frankly, they are making their decisions on does it make good business sense, what are the costs, have we got the people, have we got the skills that we need ”More generally, she supports the X strategy, stating: “That focus on innovation is very important, to get an edge on other parts of the world, to find out niches and I think we have been quite good at that, cyber security, financial technology, creative, film and television.”Following her forced resignation nearly a year ago, Mrs Foster said she made a “a decision that I still wanted to advocate for Northern Ireland because I love the place”.She added: “I will never talk down Northern Ireland.”Related topicsArlene FosterNI ProtocolUkraineThe Executive OfficeBoris JohnsonMore On Arlene Foster PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionLove, laughter and tears... how NI’s famous faces celebrated ‘special mums’ PremiumLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’DUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly election PremiumMartin McGuinness: ‘History will judge him kinder than Gerry Adams.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

Villagers had suffered from the awful impact of the Hungry Thirties in one of the most socially deprived regions of the UK after the closure of the village spinning mill in .By November  United Chrome Tanners were employing  people tanning sheep skins and cattle hides for shoes, handbags and clothing.Within less than  years they were a world leader, employing more than  people and under the leadership of Erik Utitz became the first NI winners of the Queens award for exports.Leather tanning eventually died out in the village in .Details of the Jewish project, which received funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, can be found at this website: www.belfastjewishheritage.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Lawyer eyeing SDLP result in Strangford  ","story":"CONOR Houston is hoping to become Strangfordrsquos first SDLP Assemblyman when voters go to the polls on May .A lawyer and civic activist, he is going head-to-head against the DUP, UUP and Alliance who currently hold the constituencyrsquos five seats and as the parties ramp up their respective election campaigns, Mr Houston has outlined why he decided to put his name forward.He said he has been very fortunate to have had a lot of great opportunities throughout his career and wants to bring the experiences he has to make a positive impact on the people in Strangford.Mr Houston said while he has never been in politics before, there have been a few moments in his career that he believes shaped him for political le.ldquoAs a lawyer, I fought against unfairness and injustice, he continued. ldquoOne of the most frustrating things was seeing young people end up in the criminal justice system.ldquoSo many of them came from situations of poverty, abuse, addiction and been failed by our education and care systems.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

agreeing to the closure of the tourist information centre housed within the St Patrick Centre.The role of the two council staff who manned the tourist information centre will now be handled by St Patrick Centre employees.Cllr Enright is also concerned that a proposal he tabled at a recent council meeting for the issue to be further discussed was rejected.ldquoTo suggest that the Saint Patrickrsquos Centre can somehow pick up the slack on its diminished funding makes no sense, he declared. ldquoWe need a full time tourism office working seven days a week in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright

tourism crown, cannot become an afterthought when it comes to tourism promotion.Cllr Brown said he was ldquomost disturbed by the development, which ldquoworryingly follows on the back of the scaling-down of the Down County Museum.He continued: ldquoIt is unreasonable for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to expect the Saint Patrick Centre to pick up the slack from the loss of these two tourism staff with no increase in funding, he continued.ldquoFunding for the Centre was slashed from pound, per annum to pound, per annum  years ago, with the local council paying pound, in rent for the tourism centre located in the building.ldquoThis means that the Centre has had to manage on pound, per annum with no inflation adjustment for over  years and now must cover the work of two full-time council staff.He added: ldquoNo matter what way the issue is spun, it is about a net cut in essential frontline tourism services which are key to tourism growth and economic development in this area.ldquoWhile I am aware of the huge amount of voluntary work and fundraising that goes on at the Saint Patrick Centre, to suggest that it can easily take up the slack for two full-time council

The two identities could sit well together. It’s an institution.”Aileen Kendall wrote: “Portrush is my home town and it has died without Barry’s or whatever you choose to call it.“I couldn’t be more grateful to be able to take my children there when we visit their grandparents in summer.”With an Easter opening looking very likely there has been an appeal by Curry’s for staff for the Portrush venue.On Curry’s Facebook page they welcomed applications from those aged  and above.The Curry family, who are based in the Eglinton area of Londonderry, signed a long-term lease with joint agents Osborne King and McKibbin Commercial for the popular tourist attraction last Tuesday.They have already confirmed that the The Big Dipper will still dominate the seafront and remain a core attraction when the fun park reopens in a few weeks.It is also understood that new rides have arrived including Cornelius Gooch’s Sizzler and Curry’s Crazy Frogs as well as new dodgems, carousel horses and new tokens.Barry’s has been one of the north coast’s most popular tourist attractions for generations. It was owned by the Trufelli family since it opened in , and was sold last year.Last week it was announced that Curry’s were to resurrect the fun park.Owen Curry from Curry’s Fun Park said: “We are delighted to have secured such a prominent trading location that is very important to Portrush and the wider north coast area.“As a family that is synonymous with the leisure industry, we can appreciate what the Trufelli family brought to Portrush over the decades.“We look forward to building on that great foundation – Portrush is an iconic destination in Northern Ireland for locals and visitors alike. “We are very excited by the prospect of operating this legendary amusement park and we look forward to getting started.”l Morning View, page "},{"url":null,"title":"delia smith on spirituality ","story":"No united Ireland for generations to come, insists Doug Beattie as UUP launch election manesto   Ramadan : What is Ramadan  Ramadan dates  - and how to wish someone a happy RamadanNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleDelia Smith on spiritualityShe may have turned , but cookery legend Delia Smith is showing no signs of slowing down.By Helen McGurkFriday, st April , : pm  \"       \"  TV cook Delia Smith has published a new book on spirituality“I still have a great zest for le,” she says. “If everybody did what I do they’d all be the same.“If you keep yourself occupied it’s much better for you than thinking, ‘I’m going to put my feet up and watch the six o’clock news every day’.”Long before Nigella Lawson, Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver became famous, Delia was the go-to TV cook of choice, teaching people easy-to-follow practical skills on all aspects of cooking, from how to make toast to organising delicious Christmas fare and even cheating at cooking.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Supermarkets ran out of cranberries in  when she used them in her Winter Collection. Delia’s How to Cook TV series in  led to a reported % increase in sales of eggs.Smith’s mantra was that anyone could do it, as budding cooks followed her easy-to-follow, reliable recipes. When serving up a mouth-watering dish to their guests, dinner party hosts would announce with confidence, ‘It’s a Delia’.Away from the kitchen, Smith still cheers on her team every week at Norwich City , never misses a match and her famous ‘Let’s Be ‘Avin’ You’ rallying cry on the pitch to supporters in  remains one of the most memorable Premier League rants. Her current goal is to stop her team being relegated.To keep trim and healthy, she regularly cycles around the meadow which backs on to their home in Suffolk and only has one main meal a day.Now, Smith is serving up a new book on spirituality, You Matter: The Human Solution.Despite selling more than  million cookbooks, she was turned down by six publishers before she clinched a book deal – but she’s been following spirituality for years.“It’s a letime of thought, and being fascinated by the subject. It took me five years to write it but all I can say is that what lockdown did is got it finished. The Covid pandemic became very relevant to it.”While there is much information from philosophers, as well as a nod to cultural figures including Jimmy McGovern and Paul Simon, at the heart of the book is the need for us to unite in community and take care of our spiritual selves to help overcome le’s many problems. It examines consciousness, reflection and building a worldwide community. It’s a timely message.“People say to me, ‘You can’t get the world together because you’d never get Russia, you’d never get China or North Korea’. I’m sayingthe world did get together and we had [effective] world politics and world leadership, they wouldn’t be able to refuse.“I’m an -year-old lady and I can’t do it, but I hope some of the seeds I’m sowing here will get to younger people because the younger generations can do something about it and they already are. If you look in Myanmar, Belarus, Hong Kong, there have been tremendous outpourings of young people saying ‘We don’t want to live like this, we don’t want dictators’.”She notes the need for quiet time, the peaceful silence needed to calm fears and provide reassurance and personally gets up early to have an hour of quiet time every day.“It’s quite banal in a way because that’s all it takes for human beings to get in touch with the deeper part of themselves by having stillness and silence in their lives. It’s not meditation because you are not going to ever empty your mind. It’s just giving yourself time to think. We have to come away from the noise.”She also explores the importance of not wasting time, of reconnecting with a disconnected world and of finding hope in humanity to help secure our destiny.There is still some time for cooking, as she is involved with the football club’s catering, her recipe websiteand online cookery school. Her husband does the cooking at home when she’s working.Does he follow her recipes  “He’s supposed to,” she chuckles.As her cookbooks are passed through generations, Smith’s reliable mantra lives on.She says she doesn’t miss TV cooking and rarely watches food programmes, but remains a teaching influence through her online cookery school.“A child of  can learn to make an omelette on their way to school on the busit’s on their phone. People are now giving my book, the Cookery Course to their kids when they go to university so there’s a new lot of people using it,” she says.But she doesn’t follow TV cookery shows these days and hasn’t got much to say about them.“Cookery shows are  a penny,” she observes. “I still find that young people don’t know how to cook. Sometimesthey are watching certain programmes it makes it look like nobody can do it anyway.”Being willing to fail is one of the topics she explores in the book and it’s something she has experienced herself. As a child she failed the -plus and left school with no O-levels, and when her TV and book career launched, there were times when she also had to face her fears.She recalls being at a book signing in Boots in Leeds when literally no-one bought her book, although every now and again someone would ask hershe knew where the corn plasters were.“I still giggle when I remember the time a bookshop hired the same bodyguard for me that they had used to protect Gordon Ramsay, only for the poor man to watch me sign copies for six people and a dog!“ she writes.Today, she reflects: “We could teach children from an early age that it’s OK to fail but instead we are pushing them to say they’ve got to get this many qualications and be the best you can. Obviously do your best, but it doesn’t matteryou fail. We should teach children to grow up without fear of what they can or can’t do.”She remains optimistic that humanity will get it right in the end, despite war, climate change and all the worries of the world.While her immediate thoughts are focused on spirituality, there are still times when she is happily reminded of the legacy of her cookery success.“There’s still a hangover from it. If I go to an away match, a couple of young guys will come up to me and say, ‘My mum loves you’.“But I’m very grateful that I don’t have to get up in the morning and do a half-hour TV show. It was hard, hard work.”You Matter: The Human Solution by Delia Smith is published by Mensch Publishing, priced £ hardback, £. paperback.

Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Continue with six weeks holiday in the summer at least! We get the shortest summer break in the world. State should provide free affordable childcare.”Trena Wise said: “Four weeks would be better and spread the rest throughout the year.” This was agreed with by Lisa Gerrard.Trudi Thomas said: “Five weeks and an extra week off at Christmas.”Iulia Condurache said: “These kids need this. Where is this obsession to work more is coming from  School is enough, work week is too much.

I don’t want to rule anything out. I’m currently employed here at Ajax to perform. With the cup final against Eindhoven, we still have eight finals left, and I need all my energy for that.“Anything  would just be a distraction.

It is clear we would like to continue with Christian.”Brentford goalkeeper David Raya also enjoyed a memorable international week after he received a maiden call-up to the Spanish national team and was handed a debut in Saturday’s - win over Albania..removeThe Barcelona-born stopper never represented his country at youth level but has enjoyed an excellent rise since he first signed for the west London club in .Frank insisted: “It was huge. I think for a football club of our size and the way we progressed through the leagues to now being in the Premier League, that we can have a player in the Spanish national team getting his debut, it is close to unbelievable.“It is really, really big and shows you can play for Brentford and get a debut with one of the biggest national teams or countries in the world.”Raya’s focus will now turn to taking on Champions League holders Cha.The Blues have faced uncertainty during the last month after owner Roman Abramovich announced plans to sell the club in March before sanctions were brought against the Russian-Israeli billionaire by the UK Government that forced the club to obtain a special license to continue operating.“They are Champions League winners and they can win it again so we are up against world-class players. If we go there and win, it would be the result of the season for us probably,” Frank said.“I really hope that we perform well and get a result because we have been close against the top six clubs.“I know it will be unbelievably dficult going to Stamford Bridge against a top Cha side.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBrian Hitchin launched legal action after he appeared in episode  – broadcast to almost  million people – of the programme’s fourth series.He claimed there was “misuse” of his private information through the “filming, making and multiple broadcasts” of the episode from October  until April , and sought damages.On Friday, a hearing at the High Court in London before Mr Justice Saini was told the dispute has been resolved through a settlement.Felicity McMahon, representing Mr Hitchin, told the court that, between April   and June  , two High Court Enforcement Agentsvisited the practice he ran in Stone, Staffordshire.They were there to enforce a High Court “writ of control” that an equipment supplier obtained against Mr Hitchin to seize goods unless he paid money he allegedly owed.Mr Hitchin, then , asked a film crew accompanying the HCEAs to leave and did not know he was being recorded on the agents’ bodycams, Ms McMahon said.The bodycam footage was used to show Mr Hitchin on screen “in a state of distress”.Ms McMahon said: “The broadcast of the programme has caused the claimant immense upset and distress.“The claimant’s case is that the programme wrongly revealed matters that were private to him which took place on his business premises.”The barrister said the episode was broadcast from October   to more than . million people in a form which showed Mr Hitchin’s face and later to a further almost . million people with his face blurred and name removed.The court heard that, on November  , a judge at Stafford County Court ordered that the equipment supplier “acted unreasonably” by issuing a claim against Mr Hitchin “for money which was not owing”..removeThe claim, which led to the writ of control, was struck out, with Channel  later updating the epilogue to its programme to make viewers aware.Ms McMahon said the broadcaster denied Mr Hitchin’s case but that the dispute had been resolved by agreement.Mr Hitchin had accepted an offer of the payment of “substantial damages”, as well as his reasonable legal costs, she said.Channel  has also agreed not to rebroadcast the programme or make it available on the internet.Tim James-Matthews, for Channel , said: “It is the defendant’s case that it has at all times believed that this programme forms part of a series of real public interest, where each of the stories involves a careful balancing exercise between matters of public interest and the right to respect for privacy.“It is prepared to accept, however, that on this occasion, in relation to the claimant, it may well have got that balance wrong and for that reason it is prepared to settle his claim and also apologise to him for the distress caused to him by broadcast of the episode in question.”Alex Cochrane, partner at law firm Hamlins, said the case involved a “very serious misuse” of Mr Hitchin’s private information.“This was a particularly egregious case he was  years old at the time the episode was filmed and he was plainly in a highly vulnerable position.“The broadcast has caused our client a signicant amount of distress over a period of several years.“I am delighted that we have been able to help Mr Hitchin obtain access to justice in this case and bring his claim to a very successful conclusion.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Channel  apologises to  uvulnerable u pensioner on Can ut Pay  We ull Take It Away! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

We told you that the tree used to make ballot paper – Flora Plio – was in short supply. Of course there’s no such thing as a Flora Plio, which is an anagram of April Fool. Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added. An official statement on the matter is due to be made at midday today .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_addfabfccccdae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbecdcdbacbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
