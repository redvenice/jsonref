He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.There is something about what he calls the “chaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians” that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. “I was always interested in shooting single photographs,” he says, “which show worlds and stories in one image.” He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. “I think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.”Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort will be published by Kerber Verlag (£36) later this spring"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b482be3840febc03346b5e1f72a2aa384e52f6c/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcc44406343a597730914f36a81fde3f","title":"art world coronavirus pandemic online artists galleries","story":"The glitzy fairs and crowded shows are history, replaced with Zoom studio tours and virtual exhibitions. Might this actually mark an improvement? In the first week of March, New York’s Armory Show opened on schedule, as it has done for the past 26 years. Despite coronavirus concerns, gallerists and collectors from across the globe packed Piers 90 and 94 on the West Side of Manhattan for one of the ritziest art fairs in the calendar. Big sales were made – a painting by the superstar contemporary painter Kehinde Wiley went for $280,000 (£220,000) – and the organisers congratulated themselves on not surrendering to the fearmongers (“New Yorkers are strong,” concluded the fair’s director, Nicole Berry). Aside from the absence of air-kissing and the prevalence of hand sanitiser, it was hard to spot anything amiss.Only a month later, the Armory Show looks like the last days of the Roman Empire. Days after it closed, European countries had gone into lockdown. Art fairs elsewhere were being cancelled by the dozen and auctions postponed. By mid-March, galleries worldwide had locked their doors haemorrhaging income, many started furloughing or laying off staff. New York itself has become the epicentre of the North American outbreak. And Pier 90 is now famous for a grimmer reason: it’s where a US Navy hospital ship is moored.There isn’t a business worldwide that hasn’t felt the virus’s impact, with calamitous results for millions. And the art world has been far from immune. An industry that has become synonymous with hyper-connectedness and global mobility is now, like the rest of us, at a standstill. The art market is idling. The places where we experience art – from leading museums to the tiniest independent spaces – are abruptly out of bounds. Many galleries are likely to go out of business artists will lose livelihoods. A recent piece by the New York magazine art critic, Jerry Saltz, carried an apocalyptic headline: The Last Days of the Art World.“It’s a pivotal moment,” suggests Frances Morris, director of Tate Modern, when we speak. “We’re going to talk in terms of before and after. The virus will change a lot of things for art.”But what sort of changes, and what sort of things? Is there only emptiness on the horizon, or are there opportunities, too? And when we finally emerge, what will art – and, yes, the art world – look like?“It’s unprecedented,” says Alison Cole, editor of industry bible the Art Newspaper. “After talking about it for years, a lot of people are finally seizing the opportunity of online.”Social media has been part of the art world for a while. But with physical galleries now empty it’s suddenly the sole means for organisations to retain a connection to audiences. The most august institutions are revealing a more unbuttoned, down-to-earth side: the Royal Academy Twitter feed, previously full of earnest promos for RA events, has been taken over by an #RAdailydoodle challenge aimed at amateur artists (sample post: “Who can draw us a thirsty ferret?”). Other galleries are trialling similar projects – less top-down, more collaborative.Morris at Tate detects a deep shift: “Having a real conversation with real people is hugely exciting. I think it’s partly because people are missing the social space of being in a museum. It’s something we haven’t always done enough. And once we reopen, we get a chance to recalibrate that.”The same is true behind the scenes, she adds: the fact that the hectic merry-go-round of openings and events has paused means that it’s possible to get hold of people. “Everyone seems more available, perversely. I’ve been having conversations with colleagues from all over the world.”Beneath all this, of course, there is a grim reality: money. With the global economy stalled, the wealth that has fuelled the art world for the past 20 years – a period of discombobulating growth, museum expansions, soaring auction prices, more art fairs by the month – is suddenly in doubt.“It feels like we’ve been partying for the last two decades,” says Morris. The commercial gallerist David Zwirner, who now has spaces in New York, Hong Kong, London and Paris, concurs: “It got out of hand, especially the market: crazy auction prices and the rest. The infiltration of value into the perception of art, art being regarded as an asset – all that needs to be rethought.”Is he fearful for the future? “Of course. There’s going to be a lot of pain, especially for smaller galleries. And, of course, artists.”Cole is similarly anxious: “At the top end, the art world is a luxury industry, but many of the people who work in it – the artists, the handlers, gallery staff – are in very precarious positions. We published an article the other day saying that a third of French galleries could close by the end of 2020. Even if the art market bounces back, it’s going to be a much smaller world.”Yet, while accounting for these very real hardships – local museums in the UK are especially vulnerable – both Cole and Morris argue that there are clues here as to how things might operate differently. “‘Normal’ was unsustainable,” Cole argues. “The endless expansion, the mega-collectors, the purchasing of big trophy objects. I think we’re entering a period of less is more. I hope it’ll be less macho.”Morris suggests that footfall-driving blockbuster exhibitions, with star loans shipped carbon-intensively from Berlin to LA to Tokyo, might have had their day. “It’d be great for museums to focus on their permanent collections, the amazing things we already possess. We’ve taken our eye off the core mission. I’d love a return to slower looking.”Everyone agrees that, whatever comes next, galleries will have a bigger role than ever. The moment they reopen, it’s hard not to see them being thronged, says Zwirner: “The work of art in a physical space is different: it craves you. Looking at art is a communal act.”The big question, of course, is what we’ll be looking at: with an event as all-enveloping as the current pandemic, is it too early to speak of “corona art”?The contemporary artist Ryan Gander has talked of the “time famine” afflicting the art world artists – like many of us – now have plenty of time on their hands. And whether they’re sequestered in their studios or trying to balance childcare and laundry, many will end up channelling their experiences of this strangest of moments into the work they make. Judging by Gander’s Zoom studio tours and Martin Creed’s livestream jam sessions, some already are.Morris isn’t sure what will result, but feels confident that it will be worth attending to: “If you look at the great traumatising events of the past – world wars, global emergencies of different kinds – artists have always responded,” she says. “After the first world war it was dada and surrealism after the second, existentialism and gestural abstraction. Whatever the work looks like, it’ll be interesting.”Keen to get an artist’s perspective, I track down the Argentinian-born, New York-based Mika Rottenberg, best known for her unsettling installations and videos, some of which take aim – appropriately enough – at the excesses of late capitalism. When we Skype, she’s in upstate New York, trying to balance home-schooling her daughter and connecting with colleagues and friends, many of whose projects have been cancelled or postponed.Nonetheless, Rottenberg seems – if not exactly upbeat – at least philosophical. As an active member of the Culture Declares climate movement, she sees a strong connection between the climate emergency and the coronavirus one, and she is thinking hard about how art fits in – both as a response and something that can illuminate a path forward. More practically, she is using tools such as video conferencing to collaborate with other artists and scope out projects. She can’t be physically present in a gallery, but perhaps she doesn’t need to be.“The fear is that we become more conservative, build a wall around ourselves,” Rottenberg says. “I really don’t want that to happen. And even if we can’t travel, I don’t want us to abandon that sense of global connectedness, the exchange of ideas. Right now we need hospital beds and ventilators and masks, but art has a role to play too. It has to.”Has she actually been able to get any work done? She laughs. “I’m used to multi-tasking. When I’m not editing video, my favourite spot in the studio is the kitchen table.”Coronavirus has shown how many of us, when trapped at home, have reached instinctively for art. Maybe it’s taking a virtual spin around the Sistine Chapel, or dusting off craft materials. Maybe it’s sketching ferrets. “People are really having to make do with what they have,” says Cole. “They’re sharing images, video, memes, using art in all sorts of creative ways.” She ponders the question. “Art is really useful at the moment. Whatever comes next, we have to cling to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3970cc2809a3c39dadc071db2a48dedeba2eb1b8/0_119_4849_2910/master/4849.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f27c929640c7a755f8d90ddd5ead9ddf","title":"supermarket staff workers tell us coronavirus affected your work","story":"Are you under extra pressure?

It started the year above $60 per barrel, before the coronavirus pandemic intervened.The price of West Texas Intermediate futures for May delivery fell as low as $10.63 on Monday, as a combination of a demand slump and rapidly filling storage capacity around the world hit markets.Oil prices are lower in real terms than at any point since the 1970s, according to Erik Britton, managing director at Fathom Consulting. He also notes the bizarre US efforts to prop up oil prices (which may have more to do with the entanglement of US companies’ interests in the White House than concern for the economy):Despite the deal to cut oil production, brokered by President Trump, oil prices have continued to track downwards - the promise of reduced supply has not kept pace with the expected reduction in demand, so far.It is one of life’s curiosities, for macroeconomists, that the US president would intervene to keep oil prices up, unless for environmental reasons, which feels unlikely with this administration. The US economy, like most advanced economies, is a substantial net beneficiary in the round from lower oil prices, even if the oil-producing sector is hurt.Here are some of the other important developments from today:You can follow our continued coverage of the pandemic response around the world:In the UK, the government says its priority is avoiding second peak of infections before easing lockdown conditionsIn the US, confirmed cases near 800,000 And in our global coverage, Spain proposes €1.5tn EU Covid-19 fundThank you as ever for reading, and join us tomorrow for more business, economics and financial markets. JJWe’ve caveated the plunging West Texas Intermediate price a few times: the futures contract for May delivery expires tomorrow, so a lot of traders are looking at the June contract.But this is not normal. It is the biggest one-day drop since the WTI futures contract, the US benchmark, was introduced in March 1983.Today’s low on the WTI May contract is now $10.77. If it goes lower than $10.35 it will be the lowest since April 1986, the only month in the contract’s record when prices fell below $10 per barrel.It’s what the industry lovingly (and to outsiders, bafflingly) refers to as “contango”, when futures are more expensive than the actual spot price of a barrel of oil. That means that traders will pay a premium to get the commodity at some point in the future because the price of storage is much too high in the short term.Kit Juckes, global fixed income strategist at Société Générale, said: This will put more pressure to reduce supply and the pressure may be felt most, under the circumstances, in North America. Nobody wants to be left with oil they can’t store when the music stops, as it is threatening to...US stock market indices fell heavily at the start of trading on Monday, as oil prices slumped with traders concerned that storage facilities are rapidly running out.*This post has been corrected. WTI fell below $11 per barrel, not $10 as previously stated.There were also some interesting comments earlier from Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, addressing the concerns that government-backed loans are not getting through to companies quickly enough.Speaking at a briefing for businesses this morning, he said that the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme’s problems are no secret, and that help is not getting at the pace needed to help the economy.Haldane also said that while most businesses had been able to hang on to existing lines of credit, fewer loans are being extended than the economy needs.The pace of lending has been remarkable, but then these are remarkable times:The Bank of England has been wielding a mixture of carrot and stick towards the banks during this crisis (perhaps more of the latter) and it seems to have worked so far: financial markets have for the most part functioned.New guidance for lenders suggests that Threadneedle Street is not yet satisfied by what the sector is doing. The Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) today said it expects banks to focus on continuing to support customers, even if that means using some of their buffer space. Via Reuters:The PRA said they would give lenders sufficient time after the crisis to replenish their liquidity and capital buffers, which they are forced to hold in better times in case of catastrophe - one of the lessons learned from the financial crisis 12 years ago.Startups probably get more coverage than they warrant on the whole, but then they are seen as a key source of the kind of innovation that’s important for an economy’s long-term prosperity. That’s why the government is stepping in with support.Fast-growing UK companies will be offered £1.25bn in taxpayer-backed loans, as the government attempts to protect emerging sectors of the British economy during the coronavirus pandemic, writes the ’s economics correspondent, Richard Partington.In the latest intervention to cushion the unfolding economic blow, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the financial package would help support technology and life sciences firms so they could continue to develop innovative products, powering UK growth in future.You can read the full report on who is eligible for support here:Sir Richard Branson has faced mounting criticism for pleading for taxpayers’ cash, rather than using his own fortune to rescue the airline. Now he has pledged to put up his private Caribbean island as collateral to raise money in a blog post pleading for a government bailout.You can read the full report here:Activitst are not happy. Here is Fiona Nicholls, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK:Richard Branson’s letter failed to convince us that suing the NHS wasn’t bad for the health service, moving his money to a tax haven wasn’t to avoid tax, or that emitting millions of tonnes of pollution wasn’t bad for the environment.There are still no justified grounds to give Virgin an unconditional bailout. Public money should be used for public goods. That should include improving workers’ rights and protections, cutting back on bonuses and idends, and limiting flights to a level compatible with the Paris Agreement.If we allow polluting industries to use the pandemic to dodge their responsibility to cut carbon, we will be turning a global crisis into a catastrophe.”And US stock market futures are also indicating pain ahead for Wall Street.A quick round-up of market news as we approach lunchtime in London.Argentina’s international creditors have rejected the government’s plans to ease the burden of $66.2bn in debt as the country tries to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Argentina is heading for its ninth default unless it can reach an agreement with its creditors on debt restructuring. So far, the group (a lot of whom are US fund managers) is not playing ball.Members of the group include AllianceBernstein, Amundi Asset Management, Ashmore, BlackRock, BlueBay Asset Management, Fidelity Management \u0026amp Research Co. and T. Rowe Price Associates. Another, separate group has already rejected the government’s proposals.The lenders are afraid they will lose their big anticipated profits if they agree to Argentina’s demands for a three-year repayment holiday and a steep cut in interest payments. The group’s statement said:Regrettably, despite the efforts of the group and other stakeholders, the proposals contained in the recently published press release are not ones which the group can or will support.The group believes that all stakeholders in Argentina will need to contribute to a solution that puts Argentina on a path toward sustainable growth and financial stability.The statement does implicitly acknowledge sharing the burden is appropriate, suggesting there will be more tough negotiations to come.What do investors know about pandemics? No more than the average person on the street, for the most part. So don’t take the below chart as a forecast - but it is a useful indicator of worsening market sentiment.Deutsche Bank’s survey of market participants has found that the outlook for a return to normal life has worsened:But bear in mind this puzzlewarning about the sometimes arbitrary functioning of markets: Interestingly the equity market has surged since this last survey even though the reality of the new slow return to normal emerges. An update on oil markets: it has got even worse for US crude futures.Here is what it looks like this year: a brutal selloff as demand has plunged (although happily that also cushions some of the blow to economies that run on oil).This is the point in the oil market cycle when traders are looking all over for somewhere to put their oil in the hopes they can sell it once prices have risen again - whether it be ships, trains, but certainly not planes.People spent most in London, the south east and south west.The bakery chain Pain Quotidien is reportedly close to collapse as it tries to find a buyer.The company, which has 26 UK sites, could appoint administrators as soon as this week, according to Sky News. It reported: An emergency sale process for the business, which trades from 26 sites in Britain, has set a deadline of Wednesday for offers.  Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal, the professional services firm, is overseeing the auction and is likely to be appointed as administrator unless a solvent sale is concluded in the coming days, insiders said on Monday. Primark has agreed to pay an additional £370m to suppliers to cover stock in production or yet to be delivered after criticism for cancellation of orders during the coronavirus crisis.The cut price fashion chain, which has been forced to close stores around the world as part of efforts to control the spread of the virus, does not have an online outlet and has joined many rivals in cancelling orders from suppliers as stocks mount up in its warehouses.The company had previously committed to pay for orders that were in transit or booked for shipment by 18 March. It has now extended that commitment by another month until 17 April bringing the total amount of stock committed to or held to £2bn.The retailer said it hoped to begin placing future orders for autumnwinter stock once there was further clarification of the reopening of stores. Bank has promised to refund customers more than £11.4m after failing to send the right information about unarranged overdraft charges to customers in their text alerts.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that while the bank texted customers to let them know they would end up entering into an unarranged overdraft, it failed to tell around 130,000 customers that they would be charged as a result. Some of the alerts were also sent later than they should have been.HSBC, Santander and Nationwide last year agreed to pay back millions of pounds to customers over similar breaches.David Thomasson, chief commercial officer at  Bank, said:We are very sorry that we didn’t include all the information we should have done on our overdraft text alerts, and that on certain occasions some customers did not receive these alerts before 10am as they should have done. This isn’t the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing and we are now contacting any customers who have been impacted to put things right for them as quickly as possible.Richard Branson has said he will use his private island as security to raise money in an effort to protect jobs, as he defended himself against criticisms for seeking a government bailout.Branson complained that references to his multi-billion-pound net worth do not take into account the fall in stock market valuations of the various Virgin companies in which he owns stakes.Branson’s empire was last year valued at £4.5bn b the Sunday Times Rich List. Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, which takes into account live movements in stock market values, still puts his fortune at $5.9 (£4.7bn).The post notes that he has committed $250m (or “a quarter of a billion dollars”, in Branson-speak) to protect jobs, but he is also looking for as much as £500m to help Virgin Atlantic, the airline in which he owns a majority stake, while planes are grounded. Branson also bristled against references to his residence in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), meaning he has paid the UK exchequer no personal income tax for 14 years. He and his wife moved there because of the “beautiful” surroundings, he said.Here are some excerpts from the blog:I’ve seen lots of comments about my net worth – but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw. Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities. The challenge right now is that there is no money coming in and lots going out.Today, the cash we have in the Virgin Group and my personal wealth is being invested across many companies around the world to protect as many jobs as possible, with a big part of that going to Virgin Atlantic. We will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for. This would be in the form of a commercial loan – it wouldn’t be free money and the airline would pay it back.The reality of this unprecedented crisis is that many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it. Without it there won’t be any competition left and hundreds of thousands more jobs will be lost, along with critical connectivity and huge economic value. Branson, the owner of a large stake in an intercontinental airline, also highlighted his donations to fighting the climate crisis.Hopes for the future for British households also look to have been severely curtailed, if the job security reading in IHS Markit’s household finances index is anything to go by.The reading fell off a cliff to by far its lowest since the survey began (although bear in mind that it was founded after 2008, when uncertainty during the financial crisis was at its highest). This reading was taken in the first week of April, so there could well be more pain to come. Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said:The UK Household Finance Index is already showing wide-reaching financial consequences of the lockdown measures implemented in late March.Around one-in-three UK households reported a decline in income from employment during April, which was by far the largest number since the survey began in 2009.But Hayes is still seeing the slimmest of silver linings:Nevertheless, we can still draw a small degree of positivity from the latest results, with overall measures of cash available to spend and household debt proving much more stable than workplace incomes. There was a slight pick-up in unsecured lending needs, while in some cases savings were depleted to meet immediate financing needs.Limiting the adverse impact on UK household balance sheets will be crucial in the coming months so that when economic activity does recover, consumers are not stuck repaying debts and instead are able to boost discretionary spending to aid a strong recovery. British household finances have reached their weakest point since November 2011, according to an index broadly followed by economists. IHS Markit’s UK household finance index, which measures households’ overall perceptions of financial wellbeing, plummeted to a reading of 34.9 in April, with the biggest monthly drop since the survey was started in 2009, as the financial crisis raged.At this point economic indicators are expressing the extent of rather than the fact of recession, but it is still a stark picture. And the signs for the future are not positive either. From IHS Markit’s release: With a large degree of uncertainty surrounding the time frame to which the emergency public health measures will be maintained, financial wellbeing expectations also fell sharply. Overall, the respective index signalled the strongest level of pessimism for almost eight-and-a-half years.

Young, old, rich, poor, northerner, southerner – everyone is at risk of catching, spreading and potentially succumbing to the coronavirus.However, this doesn’t mean the impact of this crisis is being felt equally. More and more, the notion that this epidemic is some kind of “great leveller” is being exposed for what it is – a complete myth.But one of the biggest underlying factors driving the disproportionate number of deaths in BAME communities is socioeconomic. It’s an uncomfortable truth that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are overrepresented in poor, overcrowded accommodation, or households with multiple generations under one roof. And it’s a fact that they are more likely to live in poverty or work in precarious and low-paid jobs. Many simply don’t have the luxury of being able to work safely from home during the lockdown. All of this contributes to a BAME population with worse health than average, lower life expectancy and a greater prevalence of serious underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes.With what we already know about Covid-19 and how it attacks those with underlying health conditions, it’s hardly a surprise that those from ethnic-minority backgrounds may be more likely to catch it and, it seems, die.It’s by no means a revelation that there’s a link between health and socioeconomic inequalities – certainly not for those who live these lives, or for all the charities, campaigners and organisations, including City Hall, that have been fighting these injustices for years. But one of the unexpected consequences of this crisis is that the depth of these inequalities is being laid bare in such a stark fashion.Of course I welcome the government’s announcement last week to launch a review into why people from BAME backgrounds are being disproportionately affected by Covid-19. But I fear we already know the conclusions of the review, and what action is needed.What would be particularly useful right now is a commitment to routinely collect and publish data on the demographics of everyone impacted by the coronavirus so that we can understand and act on these concerns. At the moment, we know the age and sex of everyone who contracts and tragically dies from the coronavirus, but we still have little additional reliable information, including about their ethnicity. If the information was collected and published in real time, it would help bring the true scale of the problem to light and provide more evidence about how to protect communities from the virus. Promises to provide this data in the future is not good enough – we need it to be collected and published right now. There simply is no good reason to wait.There will inevitably be those who say that this has nothing to do with someone’s ethnicity. Even though it can be uncomfortable for some to acknowledge, we cannot ignore the barriers of discrimination and structural racism that exist in our society, which contribute to ethnic minorities being more likely to suffer from poverty, have underlying health conditions and work in insecure, low-paid jobs.So this must be a wake-up call for our country and a catalyst for far-reaching and fundamental change. I’m a proud Londoner who often talks about how nowhere else in the world could someone from my background – the son of a bus driver, the child of immigrants and someone of Muslim faith – reach the position I have. But I want us to be even better and to live up to our British values of fairness, equality and justice for all.That’s why, once this crisis is over, we will need to forge a new social contract that advances the twin causes of racial and economic equality, and prioritises the welfare and wellbeing of every single community in this country.Ultimately, this would be the most fitting tribute we could pay to all the courageous people who have lost their lives on the frontline of this battle. And it would be the only way we can create a country where never again will someone’s race, background or socialeconomic status determine the difference between life and death.• Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09539bc6797c656bc56f7aea727145fad1dc879/0_51_4555_2733/master/4555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3efaf930fb652b327dd431ec2138ce7","title":"coronavirus master of disguise scientists viruses covid 19","story":"A host of factors determines whether a virus survives and thrives in humans. Sars-Cov-2 struck it luckyEd Newman walked to the podium with the calm confidence of a soldier and welcomed us with humility. His audience was 20 virology researchers preparing to lead groups in universities around the UK in 2016.Newman, then a Porton Down-based virologist for Public Health England, had seen more action than all of us combined. He shared photos of his travels in African villages ravaged by some of the most dangerous viruses that face humanity. Pop-up labs set up in tents, with “clean” areas on one side for DNA sequencing equipment to confirm virus infection, and patient areas to the other side, hosting beds with seriously ill people. Fascinating, how a tiny piece of genetic information wrapped in a protein coat can cause such devastation.Let’s face it, viruses that cause “the sniffles” aren’t what get most of us into virology. Some colleagues quote zombie apocalypse movies as inspiration for entering the field, and it’s true that there’s a certain macabre thrill in studying these terrible pathogens. But there are really only a few viruses able to kill us within days of infection.What is it that makes a virus deadly, or merely an inconvenience? What determines whether it spreads to become a pandemic, like Sars-Cov-2, or burns out rapidly, in a remote location? What does “success” mean, in viral terms? These are questions on many peoples’ minds, as they wonder what else might be out there. Could the next pandemic be 50 times as bad as this one? Is the lethality of viruses a grim lottery, with mere luck separating us from something like Ebola sweeping the Earth?In fact, viruses generally have to follow certain rules if they want to get ahead. Stealth is critical, because these pathogens are unable to thrive and reproduce alone. Instead, they invade host cells and rely on them to, first, decode their genetic information to produce components for new virus particles, next, assemble those components, and finally, release new viruses to infect more cells. If this process causes tissue damage that leads to organ failure, the virus risks perishing along with its host.A successful spy must be a master of disguise, and so it is with viruses: if they want to evade recognition by immune cells, they must change their protein coat frequently. This is achieved via tiny alterations in their genetic material called mutations. The Goldilocks principle applies here: if the mutations are too subtle, the viral coat will be easily identified by existing antibodies, whereas if they are too drastic they might simply inactivate the virus. The mutations that allow viruses to fly under the radar fall somewhere in between. Influenza viruses, which use rapidly evolving ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material, are experts at this game.History teaches us that influenza mutations can result in pandemics with millions of deaths, so we’ve learned to keep a watchful eye on them. As flu evolves over the months, virologists respond by producing seasonal vaccines that remain effective – for a time, at least.Coronaviruses have RNA genomes too, but they are very large. That means that there are many more opportunities for mutations to go wrong – from the virus’s point of view. As a result, they have developed a sort of “proof-reading” mechanism that edits out mutations – meaning that they change a lot less rapidly than flu does. This is good news for us, and for vaccine development. But we still need more information to determine just how long a vaccine might be effective for.How does a virus go on to achieve world domination? Getting from A to B is of the essence. Sars-Cov-2 rides droplets propelled by coughs and sneezes to board a new host. This is a more effective route of transmission than that used by non-respiratory viruses like Ebola, and its efficiency is increased if the virus particles are more stable and can survive on surfaces outside the body. This is why keeping a safe distance from each other and isolating patients is so useful in preventing new infections. Sars-Cov-2 also has a lipid-containing coat, so thorough handwashing with soap, which breaks down fats, can stop it in its tracks.It should be increasingly clear that to end the pandemic and keep Covid-19 outbreaks to a minimum, we need to seriously upgrade our spyware. We need surveillance teams of epidemiologists that decipher patterns of viral spread and molecular virologists to track virus evolution so we can update our defences. We need immunologists to help to understand how the body fights the virus and aid vaccine research. We also need trained and well-equipped doctors and nurses to safely look after infected people, and scientists to help design effective treatments.We need to fund these heroes well, and keep their kit up to date, and we need structures and public health strategies in place to promote hygiene, contain outbreaks and prevent transmission. Covid-19 has shown us that we must stay vigilant, and each of us can personally help break the transmission cycle.What if a new pathogen emerges and bears all those terrifying hallmarks of viral success – it doesn’t kill us quickly, mutates often, and is easily transmitted? We rely on the World Health Organization to report new outbreaks and international teams of experts to act rapidly to contain them. It’s important that both receive proper funding and support from governments. When someone like Newman, or the UK’s Public Health Rapid Support Team, receives a call to pick up their pop-up lab and join other defenders at the heart of the outbreak, not everyone welcomes them on location, and people are understandably reluctant to keep away from their infected loved ones. These teams will have their work cut out for them. But their work is vital. And when they return they will doubtless have lots of stories to share with the new generation of virologists – some of them, hopefully, inspired to join the fight by the crisis we’re now battling.• Dr Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18568767a9d851e27529b27cfcdf7faa6b1ce42/0_187_5230_3139/master/5230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16154e172dc8c5144527863f6857b1e5","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of dinner","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘dinner’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘dinner’.Share your photos of what dinner means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 22 April at 10am.

No such nests had been found for the previous five years.“If we compare to the year before, we didn’t have this many spawn, because turtles have a high risk of getting killed by fishing gear and humans disturbing the beach.”Leatherbacks are the world’s largest sea turtles. They are considered endangered in Thailand, and listed as a vulnerable species globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.They lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas, scarce when tourists thronged the beaches. People have also been known to dig into their nests and steal eggs.Late in March, staff at a national park in the southern province of Phang Nga, bordering the Andaman Sea, found 84 hatchlings after monitoring eggs for two months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d07c617c2a7c5dee47f0f2cfbfa8dad2dae983/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f123abef993c79425927b61cf3c530a6","title":"deepwater horizon 10 years later could it happen again","story":"The danger of deepwater oil operations, combined with the loosening of Obama-era rules, mean the risk of a repeat disaster is highA massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in 2010, experts warn, 10 years after the disastrous explosion of BP’s rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe.The blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism.But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration’s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission’s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill.Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill.“Disasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you’re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,” she said. “There are a lot of things that can go wrong.”Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries.“Of course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,” Beinecke said. Richard Sears, the commission’s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but “there are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deepwater”.“Everybody has to stay vigilant,” Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but could do more to limit industry risk.Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization.In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in a bid to allow a new ision of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling.The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig.Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry’s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors.Trump has pushed an agenda of “energy dominance”, which critics say encourages industry to take risks.A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US – more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico.His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE’s director repeatedly calling them “partners”.“BSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,” the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017.Internal emails suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns. Staffers at BSEE who spoke anonymously to E\u0026ampE News depict a “broken” agency run by Angelle, who is a former Louisiana politician and longtime supporter of the gulf oil industry.Meanwhile, drillers have moved farther and deeper offshore, pursuing wells with enough oil to produce for decades, known in the industry as “elephants”. Low oil prices – from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking – haven’t kept them out of the water. Most of the $93m in leases sold by the US in the gulf last month were in deep water.“Offshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,” said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. “These are being drilled in deep water and they’re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they’re being drilled in more complex geology.”The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about 5,000ft, or close to a mile, down. Other platforms still operating in the gulf are as deep or deeper. One drilled in 2001, called “Blind Faith”, is still producing, according to 2019 documents from Chevron. It reaches 7,000ft to the gulf floor.Deans called the current regulatory approach “an honor system” that “smacks of exactly the kind of self-enforcement that the independent commission found to be a fatal flaw” in the BP blowout.“Definitely, it could happen again,” he said. “You cannot make these operations safe. All you can do is try to reduce the risk.”Smaller-scale incidents that don’t make the news occur frequently in the gulf. Between 2007 and 2018, there were an average of 115 fires and explosions in federal waters annually, about one every three days, according to government data. There were also nearly 50 fatalities over that time.Donald Boesch, a biological oceanographer and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who was also on the commission, said Trump’s changes have undermined offshore safety.“Many steps have been taken by both government and industry since the accident 10 years ago … I felt comfortable – not that the risk was reduced to negligible – but that we were in better shape now than we were,” Boesch said. “I’ve frankly been made more concerned about how the safety issues are being treated under the Trump administration.”Still, sources familiar with industry say the big companies learned a lesson as they watched BP suffer huge reputational damage and pay $65bn for its mistakes.Wesley Williams, a petroleum engineering professor at Louisiana State University, who was awarded a nearly $5m research grant from a fund BP was forced to pay into, said the “real motivator” for industry was “the image issue that happened and the financial cost of what happened to BP”.“From the large operators, I’ve seen a big change in safety culture,” Williams said.But the sector consists of more than just the brands most people can identify, like BP, Shell and Exxon. Those companies work with large networks of contractors, and smaller independent operators are active in the gulf too. Williams said they did not always have the resources for extensive safety training.John Amos, president of SkyTruth, a not-for-profit conservation technology organization, said:“The next major oil spill, when it happens, will catch us off guard … like every previous one has, unless we decide that this time it’s going to be different,” Amos said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d72ab36ffe164d7b3d9c0c8363e26ffcc08cce/0_186_5202_3121/master/5202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d6ad21abcbe117ebe6b5b7c5056b857","title":"no way food safety not compromised us regulatory roll backs during covid 19 criticised","story":"Major pork plant closed after hundreds of workers contract coronavirus, while speeding up of poultry production lines raises concerns over standardsThe US government is accelerating controversial regulatory rollbacks to speed up production at meat plants, as companies express growing alarm at the impact of Covid-19 on their operations.The latest line speed increases, announced by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) mean 11 poultry plants have been given waivers to operate higher line speeds in the past fortnight. A number of beef and pork plants have also been given waivers, including a beef plant in Kansas in late March. The move will allow the additional chicken factories to slaughter as many as 175 birds a minute – the equivalent of 3 per second.A union representing federal food safety inspectors has said faster lines will make it harder to catch “pathology that shouldn’t be going out to the consumers”.Increased line speeds are supported by the poultry industry, which argues they do not represent additional risk to food or workers safety, and are necessary to remain financially competitive. Three years ago the National Chicken Council lobbied the government to scrap line speed limits completely, calling them “arbitrary”.Under traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with inidual regulatory waivers enabling line speed increases.“It potentially reduces some of the quality control efforts, but I am not concerned about worker safety as a result of the increased line speeds. Some plants are actually reducing speeds because of employee absenteeism,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst at IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence.Campaigners have filed a petition with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), demanding that it declare certain types of salmonella in meat products adulterants (meaning producers have an obligation to withhold contaminated batches), because they “constitute an imminent threat to public health necessitating prompt agency action”.“We’ve been playing around with these standards for 20 years now,” said Corbo, one of the parties to the petition, “and it doesn’t seem to be working in terms of reducing the amount of food-borne illness in this country. People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.”In 2011, when the FSIS set a target to reduce food-borne illness, the incidence level for salmonella was estimated at around 16.4 people per 100,000. The FSIS’s plan aimed to reduce that number to 11.4 by this year, but instead, after a small decline over five years, it has now risen to 18.3, according to a CDC spokesperson.A spokesperson for the Chicken Council disagreed with criticisms of the sector. He told the : “No one wants to reduce salmonella more than the companies producing our food. Our families eat the same chicken.” The council opposes the petition, he stated. “We agree with FSIS, and previous court rulings, that a science-based, multitiered approach aimed at reducing all salmonella on raw meat and poultry products results in a more appropriate and effective use of agency resources compared to a separate and specific focus on specific inidual strains.”Campaigners say the FSIS is limited in its ability to keep US meat and poultry healthy. A critical report on the FSIS by the US Government Accountability Office in 2018 stated that a review of data had shown that “some plants are still not meeting pathogen standards – in some cases repeatedly not meeting the standards – and are allowed to operate”. It also pointed out that the agency still had no mandatory recall authority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea97c6f1ed87aaabac383a013375c6e670a24e30/0_125_2666_1598/master/2666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8e16ab1d026d1c6e3512b8148802deb","title":"john lewis and mother of pearl mark earth day with joint fashion line","story":"Sustainable fashion collaboration featuring only biodegradable fabrics will be sold onlineJohn Lewis and the fashion brand Mother of Pearl have chosen Earth Day for the launch of their sustainable fashion collaboration, specifically for its geopolitical symbolism.Earth Day, which celebrates its 50th anniversary on 22 April, seemed an appropriate day to launch a collection bringing rigorous standards of ethical design to mass market fashion. A launch date that pays homage to the planet rather than the artificial seasons of fashion, and dovetails with the concept of timeless, seasonless clothes designed for wardrobe longevity.The date was decided on six months ago, and arrives carrying a rather different significance. During an unprecedented shutdown which has seen consumer demand crushed, and with all 50 John Lewis department stores currently closed, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners + Mother of Pearl will go on sale online only.It is a strange moment to be selling clothes, concedes the Mother of Pearl designer Amy Powney. “When you strip everything back to basics, you question what you need and what you don’t. This time at home has made everything feel more sacred. Every purchase, every walk, every conversation with friends and family.”Earth Day has been growing in profile as a key date in the fashion calendar. The sustainable sneaker brand Allbirds, which marked Earth Day 2019 by donating proceeds from the sales of limited edition shoes to the protection of birds endangered by climate change, are marking this year’s date by becoming the first brand to label their products with a carbon footprint counter, along the lines of calorie information printed on processed food. The brand’s bestselling Wool Runners come with a carbon “price tag” of 7.2kg. For comparison, a pair of jeans averages 29.6kg, and a plastic shopping bag 1.6kg.Powney believes that the most practical way to tackle the problem of fast fashion is to offer consumers a desirable alternative, and sees lockdown as an opportunity to steer consumers in a new direction. “Fashion most certainly isn’t a top priority right now. But seeing the world’s carbon emissions start to drop as the world comes to a standstill is a clear signal that if we collectively change our habits and everyday actions, we can make better decisions to help our planet heal.”Featuring breezy polka dot dresses, striped shirting and an elegant caramel-toned trouser suit with her label’s trademark outsize pearl buttons, this collection is an opportunity for Powney to take her “mission” for sustainable, ethical, traceable fashion to a wider audience without compromising her principles.“I really appreciate that John Lewis don’t sell trend-led, fashion-crazed collections,” she says. Prices start at £59. “In my opinion, some of the prices you see on the high street elsewhere are so low that you don’t need to know about supply chains to work out that someone has lost out in the making of them,” she adds.The collection’s ethical credentials are centred on sustainable fabrics, with all pieces produced either in Tencel or organic cotton, both of which are biodegradable. Tencel wood-pulp fibres are derived from sustainably managed sources, processed into fibre by the sustainable textile manufacturers Lenzing via a closed-loop system designed to minimise water and energy usage. Virtual sampling, in which garments are trialled on digital avatars without any fabric being cut, has been used to cut down waste and minimise the carbon footprint of transportation.“We completely understand that today is a very different moment to the day we began this collection,” says Jo Bennett, the head of buying for John Lewis, of the lockdown launch. “But we are still looking for some escapism, and moments of joy.”A plan to mark the launch with a pop-up buy-back scheme at John Lewis’s London flagship was mothballed by store closures, but the sustainability drive continues online, with personal stylists offering video appointments to advise on wardrobe clearouts, “to help customers rediscover treasured items and build outfits”.While store closures and the stay-at-home orders have hit clothing sales hard, Bennett says online sales of coloured and patterned tops – ideal for smart video conference calls – have bucked the trend. But Powney, currently juggling caring for her three-month-old daughter Niamh with the stress of keeping a small fashion business afloat, admits she has let her aesthetic standards slip. She describes her working from home wardrobe as “a total disaster … leggings and my husband’s T-shirts, mostly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43268aa639add177fad9bdc6f7b6c4f1d75ea88/873_0_6693_4022/master/6693.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1381c987834156f14c830da676f938e8","title":"nigel slater easy egg recipes souffle tagliatelle cheese croissants","story":"Asparagus souffle, mushroom tagliatelle, baked cheese croissants, apricot and lemon curd cake – seven delicious recipes that are as good as goldI long to break into the freckled shell of a boiled egg and lift its snow white and deep orange heart with a teaspoon. I even find myself gazing at a fluffy omelette, its baveuse interior oozing out as the fork goes in. But alas, there is no cheque large enough to tempt me to eat an egg. Whether boiled, scrambled, poached or fried, the egg has always been my culinary bête noir. I like my oeufs well and truly hidden. Custard, cake, meringue or mayonnaise are among my favourite things to eat, as is a souffle, a creme caramel or a mousse, but the egg must always be in total disguise. I have been like this all my life and I reluctantly admit that, at this age, my aversion is unlikely to change.But I don’t write this column for myself, I write it for you and, let’s be honest, most sensible people do find the egg one of the most indispensable ingredients in the kitchen. So eggs it is, cheap and as cheerful as a sunny spring morning. In the recipes that follow there are crisp golden croissants cooked in the style of eggy bread eggs briefly baked with pink prawns and scarlet chillies, there are egg whites in a souffle and yolks in a peppercorn-spiked mayonnaise. I have also made a tender loaf cake with dried apricots and homemade lemon curd, and a garlic-flecked tangle of tagliatelle. Who knows, I may eat that boiled egg yet.A simple dish of baked eggs with shellfish and aromatics. You can use prawns, tiny beige brown shrimps or crayfish tails here. This is a quick supper so I would probably buy them ready shelled rather than shell my own. Use Italian basil if the deliciously aniseedy Thai variety proves evasive.

Roughly chop the spring onions. (I like to cut them diagonally into 2cm lengths.) Chop the chilli similarly.Put the basil leaves and the crayfish tails or prawns into a medium-sized baking dish. Break the eggs into the dish, then scatter the onion and chilli over the top. Trickle the oil over and season with salt and black pepper.Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven until the eggs have just set. Scatter the nori flakes and toasted sesame seeds over.Late last Sunday morning, I brought to the table a batch of croissants cooked in the style of pain perdu, but stuffed with dark curls of speck and pools of melted fontina. Deliciously crisp and brown, the cheese formed pizza-style strings and they disappeared in minutes. Other cheeses will work here, but a semi-hard, easy to grate cheese is best.Makes 4eggs 6grain mustard 1 tbspmilk 100mlcroissants 4 large fontina 150gspeck or other air-dried ham 8 thin slicesSet the oven at 200C fangas mark 6.Break the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk them lightly to combine yolks and whites. Stir in the mustard and 100ml of the milk.Using a breadknife, cut the croissants in half horizontally then dunk them in the egg and milk, pushing them down so they are thoroughly soaked. Lay the bottom halves of each croissant side by side in a baking dish or roasting tin.Grate the fontina. Divide the speck between the croissants, tearing it as necessary, then sprinkle 25g of cheese over each of the ham-covered halves. Place the top halves back in place on each croissant, then scatter over any remaining cheese.Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes till the cheese has melted.I have always enjoyed making mayonnaise, except for the rare occasion when it fails (normally on very humid or thundery days). The speed at which you add the oil really does make all the difference. I start with a few, large single drops, increasing the flow to never more than a mere trickle. Adding too much oil in one go will almost always result in a curdled mayonnaise.The green peppercorns you need are the soft, dark green variety sold in little jars of brine. I like the brief bursts of heat you get from adding them whole, but you could crush them using a pestle and mortar for a more even, gradual heat. If you don’t have any peppercorns in the cupboard, keep the recipe for another time.For the mayonnaiseegg yolks 3dijon mustard 2 tspcider vinegar 1 tspgroundnut oil 100mlolive oil 50mlgreen peppercorns in brine 1 tspdill 10gFor the saladwhite chicory 2 headsred chicory 2 small headsparsley a small bunchdill a few sprigsFor the mayonnaise, put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the mustard and cider vinegar. Mix thoroughly, then slowly add the oils, a drop at time, whisking continuously with a large balloon whisk accelerating to a steady stream as the mayonnaise starts to thicken.Drain the green peppercorns of their brine but don’t rinse them, add them to the mayonnaise. Finely chop the dill, stir into the mayonnaise, cover and refrigerate.Separate the chicory leaves and wash in cold running water. Dry them in a salad spinner or on a tea towel, then put them in a large serving bowl. Tear the parsley leaves and dill fronds from the stems and add them to the chicory. Pour over the mayonnaise dressing and toss gently to coat the leaves.Place 2 smoked trout fillets on each plate, sprinkle a little cider vinegar over the fillets, then place some of the chicory mayonnaise at their side.A hint of springtime here with tiny mushrooms and a faint breath of aniseed. As you twirl the tagliatelle round your fork, the egg yolk is very lightly cooked by the residual heat of the freshly drained pasta. (That said, this isn’t a recipe for anyone who wants to avoid raw egg.) Chervil, which I find from time to time at the greengrocer, adds a light aniseed note to this tangle of pasta and parmesan. It is isn’t the easiest herb to get hold of, and if you can’t find its delicate lace-like leaves you could use tarragon.Bring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt generously.Cut the mushrooms into quarters or in thick slices, as you wish. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the mushrooms and let them cook, with the occasional stir or shake, for 8-10 minutes till golden and starting to crisp.Chop the black garlic and add to the mushrooms then turn off the heat. The garlic will cook in the residual heat.Cook the tagliatelle in the boiling water for 8 or 9 minutes till al dente, then drain and immediately toss with the mushrooms, garlic and chopped parsley. Add the chervil leaves then ide between two plates or pasta bowls. Break the eggs and separate the white and yolks (you only need the yolks). Add a yolk to the middle of each dish then grate the parmesan over. Stir the egg yolk and cheese into the pasta as you eat.I look forward to the arrival of the first locally grown asparagus in spring with the same excitement I do the first gooseberries of summer, or the damsons of early autumn. It is the clearest of seasonal markers, the first true sign that spring is well and truly here. And yes, it does seem to appear earlier with each passing year and I have no problem with that. You could make an asparagus souffle by boiling and pureeing the tips and folding them in with the egg whites, but that would be to lose much of the elegance of the spears themselves. I prefer to cook the souffle in a shallow baking dish with the spears peeping through the cheesy clouds.Serves 2-3To prepare the dishbutter a knobparmesan 2 tbsp, finely gratedasparagus 12 spearsFor the soufflemilk 300mlbay leaf 1onion 1 small, peeledtarragon 15g, leaves picked and choppedbutter 55gflour 50geggs 4 large, separatedstrongly flavoured, firm cheese such as yarg, gruyere or cheddar 125g, grated or cut into small piecesparmesan 3tbsp, gratedLightly butter the inside of a baking dish measuring about 28cm x 22cm, then scatter in the 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan, tipping the dish from side to side to make sure the cheese sticks to the butter.Cook the asparagus in boiling water for 8 minutes then drain on kitchen paper. Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 6. Bring the milk to the boil in a small pan together with the bay leaf and onion. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. Melt the butter in a small, heavy-based saucepan, stir in the flour and leave over the heat for two or three minutes, stirring almost continuously. (You can chuck the bay and onion at this point – they have done their work.) Stir in the warm milk, gradually at first, then a little faster, till you have a thick sauce. Let it come to an enthusiastic bubble, then lower the heat and let the mixture simmer for at least 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until it is thick and smooth. If your sauce looks lumpy, then whisk fiercely until it is smooth and thick. Remove from the heat, cool briefly, then stir or whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Work quickly, otherwise the egg will cook before it gets stirred in.Stir the grated cheese and chopped tarragon into the sauce. In a large bowl, using a large balloon whisk beat the egg whites till stiff and frothy. Fold them gently but firmly into the cheese sauce, then immediately scrape into the buttered dish.Place the spears of asparagus on top of the cheese sauce, then scatter the grated parmesan over. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes till puffed and golden.As I took this still warm cake from the oven, the scent of citrus and butter wafted up, reminding me of why I bake rather than buy. There are three elements here: the apricot sponge itself the lemon curd and the crumble that crowns the cake. This is not a recipe to hurry. Instead, a piece of baking to take your time over, an hour or two of quiet hands-on time in the kitchen, perhaps with the radio on and no distractions. The finished cake will keep for several days in a cake tin. We ate it as both tea-time treat (with a pot of fresh mint tea) and as dessert, with a spoonful of thick yogurt nudging against the crumble crust. The recipe makes slightly more lemon curd than you need, but it will keep for a week in a stoppered jar in the fridge. A truly splendid thing when spread thickly on hot, toasted muffins.Serves 8For the lemon curdunwaxed lemons 4caster sugar 200gbutter 100geggs 3egg yolk 1For the cakebutter 125gcaster sugar 125gself-raising flour 75gground almonds 75geggs 3 mediumsoft dried apricots 75gicing sugar for dustingFor the crumblebutter 80gplain flour 110gdemerara sugar 3 tbspicing sugar 2 tbspYou will need a 20cm x 10cm x 7cm rectangular loaf tin lined with baking parchment.Make the lemon curd: finely grate the lemons, then squeeze their juice. Put the lemon zest and juice, the sugar and the butter, cut into cubes, into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the basin doesn’t touch the water. Stir with a whisk from time to time until the butter has melted.Mix the eggs and egg yolk lightly with a fork, then stir into the lemon mixture. Let the curd cook, stirring regularly, for about 10 minutes, until it is thick and custard-like. It should feel heavy on the whisk. Remove from the heat and stir occasionally as it cools.Make the cake: cream the butter and caster sugar together until light and fluffy. This is best done using a food mixer. Stir together the flour and ground almonds. Break the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork or small whisk. Chop the apricots finely using a food processor.While the butter and sugar are creaming together, make the crumble. Rub the 80g of butter, in small pieces, into the flour, then stir in the demerara sugar and set aside. Set the oven at 180C fangas mark 4. Line the cake tin.Add the beaten egg, a little at a time, to the creamed butter and caster sugar. If the mixture starts to curdle, then add a few tablespoons of the flour to bring it together. Mix in the flour and chopped apricots.Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf tin and smooth the surface. Spoon in 250g of the lemon curd and smooth the surface. Trickle a teaspoon or two of cold water over the crumble mix and shake the dish so the crumbs form a mixture of fine and coarse lumps. It makes for a more interestingly textured crumble. Tip the crumble over the lemon curd then bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until lightly firm.Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to rest until almost cool. Remove the cake from the tin, peel away the parchment, dust the cake with icing sugar and serve.For the praline creamshelled pistachios 75gcaster sugar 150gdouble cream 250mldried rose petals a handfulPut a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Break the chocolate into small pieces, and let it melt in the bowl without stirring. Remove from the heat as soon as the chocolate is liquid, add the butter in small pieces and stir, very briefly, then add the hot coffee, stirring gently.Separate the eggs and beat the whites until they are almost stiff. Stir the egg yolks into the melted chocolate then fold the whites in, making sure there are no lumps of unincorporated egg white.Put the bowl in the fridge, covered, and leave for at least four hours to set.Shortly before you wish to eat, make the praline: put the pistachios and sugar into a large, shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Let the sugar melt and turn a dark amber. Try to avoid stirring and instead, move the pan left and right, encouraging the caramel to melt evenly.When the sugar has all melted and you have rich, mid-brown caramel, pour onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to set.Break the praline into pieces and reduce to coarse crumbs in a food processor, or by crushing and shattering with a rolling pin. Lightly whip the cream until it is almost stiff then fold in most of the crushed praline.Spoon large scoops of mousse onto plates, then add an almost equal amount of praline cream to each. Scatter over the reserved crushed praline, and if you have any, a few dried or fresh rose petals.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e37c01135f995cef66aa3688ecc938d5486cbe3/0_10_8015_4808/master/8015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d765ffe63e6184f09fcda2d2b617fd7","title":"rachel roddy piadina flatbread recipe","story":"A cheerful, simple flatbread you eat straight from the pan, loaded with soft cheese, prosciutto and greensNo 17 on my plan of things to do when things change: take the 7.25am train from Roma Termini to Ravenna, walk out of the station in search of the first place that will serve me a piadina romagnola, then eat the warm fold as I walk towards Piazza Del Popolo. Until then, I will make them at home.Why has it taken me so long to make piadine? Why has it taken me so long to discover the basic pleasure of making a child-like dough of flour, bicarbonate of soda, water and olive oil, to roll it into plate-sized circles, prick them all over with a fork, cook them in a hot pan until they take on leopardprint to rival that of Bet Lynch, then fold them around soft cheese, salty ham and some of the rocket we should be rationing for the tortoise.Like focaccia, piadine have ancient roots and probably take their name from the Latin plàdena o plàtena. Traditionally, they were cooked on a testo, an absolutely flat terracotta plate that was warmed in wood ovens until hot enough to cook the rounds of dough. The evolution of wood-fired and gas cookers meant a terracotta testo could be heated directly on the stovetop, and the evolution of cooking utensils in the 1970s meant it could be made from cast iron and aluminium, which became common. The first flat I rented in Rome had a testo, not that I knew what it was at the time. To my ignorant eyes, it looked like a large aluminium ping-pong bat with a bulbous wooden handle that was slightly too long for the cupboard, so pushed it open slightly. Useless and annoying, I thought: more fool me.The key to piadine is eating them while they are really hot. This means gathering everyone around and having all the fillings ready: slices of salami, prosciutto or ham, soft cheeses such as stracchino, gorgonzola or cream cheese, also some greens, such as rocket or watercress. As soon as your piadina comes out of the pan, fill and spread one half, then fold the other half over. Eat immediately, ideally with a cold beer or glass of lip-staining dry lambrusco.500g plain flour125g lard or 80g olive oil1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda15g salt180g waterTo serveSalami, prosciutto, ham, soft cheeses (stracchino, gorgonzola or cream cheese) and, if you wish, greens such as rocket or watercress.If you are using lard, use your fingertips to rub it into the flour until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, bicarb, water and, if you are using it instead of lard, the olive oil, and bring everything into a consistent dough. Wrap in a cloth and leave to rest for an hour.Cut into six pieces and then, one by one, roll them into thin (1-2mm) plate-sized discs (about 22cm in width). Use a fork to prick the discs all over.Warm a nonstick pan until it is hot. Cook the discs one by one, giving them about two minutes a side and turning them continually, so they cook evenly. You want them to acquire leopard-like spots. Serve while still hot, folded around prosciutto andor cheese.

Given the reason for the delay, however, this really isn’t a case of bad manners. “Sorry,” Blackstock says. “That was just 500,000 masks coming into the country. They’ve just landed. It’s come from China and will go straight out to councils.”No wonder Blackstock, who has been building connections in the pharmaceutical world since retiring from football in 2017, is in demand. The 33-year-old former Queens Park Rangers and Nottingham Forest striker is the founder and chief executive of a medical technology firm, MediConnect, and all he can think about now is getting personal protective equipment to frontline staff dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. “This is from when I wake up to when I sleep,” Blackstock says. “The demand is through the roof.”It hardly needs pointing out that this is not a straightforward project. NHS staff are saying they do not have enough access to PPE, while a crisis is brewing in care homes and hospices in the UK. Yet Blackstock is confident that MediConnect, a Blockchain solution, can help. His company is accepting donations from the public via a crowd-funding website, donatetonhs, and he has enlisted the support of Blackburn’s Bradley Johnson, who has given his time to the project and committed to delivering life-saving equipment to frontline staff near his home in Derby.“What MediConnect is meant for is to provide transparency for all parties within the supply chain,” Blackstock explains. “It’s to add traceability of medications, to stop opioid addiction. I was building the platform for a couple of years. You have to build a relationship with everyone along the supply chain – pharmacies, manufacturers, distributors, logistics companies – to bring it all together.“PPE is one of the biggest problems people are struggling with. I have the connections – instead of people just coming out the woodwork – which means you can actually get the product. I can help source this.”The idea grew after a conversation about fund-raising initiatives between Blackstock and Johnson, who has nothing but good to say about his friend’s entrepreneurial spirit. The website has already raised more than £12,000. Each donation can be followed up by an email request, directing it be supplied to wherever people feel it is needed.“When people donate they can see what we’re spending the money on and what supplies we’re getting,” Johnson says. “It’s a step-by-step transaction. They can donate and once we make the order we’ll put it on our website so people can see the amount of stuff we’re getting.”The aim is to go further than hospitals. “We know now how much of a shortage the NHS is going through,” Johnson says. “We want to target the NHS but also the care homes or key workers – like bus drivers who are putting their lives at risk transporting NHS staff. If we get in contact with people in Derby I’ll go out and deliver. We want it to be known we’re doing something. We’re not just sitting at home, wanting people’s money and then letting others do the work. We’re going to do it ourselves.”Blackstock was 31 when he hung up his boots. He was going through the motions at Rotherham but he had planned for the future. Now he is in a position to talk about the shortage of PPE. “It’s like toilet paper a few weeks ago,” he says. “The product can be made in the quantity required. But if everyone rushes at one time you can’t get it. If everyone in England decides to go and buy baked beans tomorrow, there won’t be enough. The rush has been too quick and the numbers are too much. The problem wasn’t the PPE, it’s just the time.“And there are a lot of people who’ve come out of the woodwork in between who are blocking deals or buying up the stock at the same time, meaning the government can’t buy it. This is worldwide. A lot of it is coming from China. China physically can’t produce that amount.“The NHS has an endless backlog. They’re kind of bullying the supplier to say: ‘We’re the biggest players, we’ll pay the most money, we need it.’ But what is happening is the councils, the care homes, the hospices and everyone below can’t get the product. So there’s not enough that can be made to distribute. England have not got access to every warehouse in China or product worldwide.”It sounds like a tricky world to negotiate. “You’ve seen some people sending money to factories that are not even there,” Blackstock says. “It’s really bad. If I just woke up today and tried to source PPE I’d get robbed from the first batch. I wouldn’t know where to go, I wouldn’t know how shipment works. I’d be finished. It can only be done from previous relationships, which I have.”Blackstock, who hopes to distribute £1m worth of equipment, speaks passionately on the issues in care homes. “Everyone has a feeling towards the NHS, but what I want to do more is get this money into the care homes, the hospices. They are on their knees. It’s not like we’re running out – we have run out for those people.“It’s the food chain. If the NHS has a shortage, where does anyone below come? If you’re on the frontline, you need equipment and the best of it. But if you’re just a care home you’re not going to be at the top and they’re really struggling. They’ve been contacting me, saying: ‘We need 100 masks, we need 500 masks, we’ve got nothing, we’ve been using the masks too long.’ They’re worried. There might be places that might not have positive-tested Covid-19 patients at the moment but could at any minute. It’s spreading fast across the care homes.”It is an initiative that jabs against the depiction of footballers as greedy and shielded from reality. “I’ll never forget where I’ve come from,” Johnson says. “My mum and dad didn’t struggle, but we had a tough upbringing. I come from a working-class family so I know how hard it is for some of these families. I’ll always remember that. The negative press, it’s sad we don’t get credit for the good stuff we do. Everyone’s quick to jump on the negative. That’s life. Me and Dex want to help.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fbbc44c4f690e310b1f30e4ae5a2cdfd08014e/201_203_2527_1517/master/2527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4be4b92001f62fb5301a129ba2c51c60","title":"efl to consider keeping transfer window open to help struggling clubs","story":"The English Football League is considering a proposal to extend the summer transfer window until at least the end of January to alleviate financial pressures on its clubs amid the coronavirus crisis.Mark Catlin, the Portsmouth chief executive, has raised with Rick Parry, the EFL chairman, the prospect of relaxing the window to enable clubs to trade players to ease next season’s cashflow and Catlin will push for the matter to be discussed at Tuesday’s conference call between League One clubs.Clubs in Leagues One and Two are expected to discuss, in separate calls, how to complete the season, with some more reluctant than others to finish the campaign, even though the EFL is committed to doing so if possible. The majority of League One and League Two clubs are understood to be receptive to Catlin’s proposal, and the matter has been raised with some Championship board members. The EFL has been open to suggestions from clubs to help tackle the crisis, particularly with the increasing inevitability of playing games behind closed doors, and Catlin believes it is a “no-brainer” for lower-league clubs not to close the summer transfer window as planned on 1 September.He argues that the relaxation of the window could help clubs to raise crucial funds and ultimately prevent them from being financially hamstrung or going bust.Many clubs are expected to head into next season with streamlined squads as a result of the pandemic, with many likely to be under financial strain because of the absence of matchday income amid an air of resignation that crowds are unlikely to return before autumn. On Monday Cambridge United became the latest club to furlough playing staff, joining Sunderland, Shrewsbury and Crewe, among others.If Championship clubs were to reject the transfer window proposal, there is a confidence that League One and League Two clubs could adopt the rules in isolation, though any proposal would require an EFL vote, as well as ratification by Uefa and Fifa.EFL clubs are hopeful of resuming training on 16 May with a view to matches starting on 6 June but there is a growing reluctance among some players over returning because of fears they could put their or others’ health at risk. The EFL continues to follow government guidance and has consistently outlined player welfare as a priority. It would be in line to pay back around £50m to broadcasters in the event its competitions were abandoned.The league and Professional Footballers’ Association held further talks over the weekend regarding player wages but one source warned the fallout was “developing into a war”, with no collective solution found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14adc5e94d0a301f1ac9f7b2dd5f67fe9ab83a31/0_47_2165_1298/master/2165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51a85877e2d93a57092f611d9dfcbe97","title":"manchester united redraw transfer budget and accept player of harry kane cost out of reach tottenham","story":"Manchester United are redrawing their transfer strategy because of financial uncertainty caused by coronavirus and accept it will leave them unable to buy a striker as expensive as Harry Kane.A proven goalscorer of the quality of Tottenham’s centre-forward is among prospective targets for Ole Gunnar Solskjær. In a regular summer United would make the money available for the manager to consider a move for the 26-year-old, who has said he will not stay at Spurs “for the sake of it” if he does not feel his boyhood club are going in the right direction.Yet with Kane under contract until 2024 he would cost in the region of £150m – a fee that has become unrealistic for United because of the lack of clarity on budgets amid Covid-19.Although Premier League clubs have discussed a return on the weekend of 13-14 June this is a best-case scenario, with a worst-case modelled on no return until October. If the season resumes behind closed doors millions of pounds of match-day revenue will be lost if no games are played the hit to revenue will be far more substantial, notably because of missing broadcast money.United have four home league games remaining and five away matches. Solskjaer’s side also have a Europa League last-16 second leg at Old Trafford against LASK, though with a 5-0 lead they can all but count on at least one more home match.

They got engaged before they started officially dating and now live in Estonia with their two-year-old daughter In the summer of 2014, Mark Brewster started a new job at a clothing company in London. “I was on a tour of the office when I met Kärri for a couple of minutes. I thought: ‘Wow, she’s fit!’” Although she left an impression on him, Kärri admits she was too busy to notice Mark. “I was totally focused on work at the time,” she laughs.Over the next few months, the pair met regularly for drinks and became friends. “We were both playing the field on Tinder,” says Mark. “There was an attraction, but I had a strict policy on not dating people I worked with, so it felt like we could be really open with each other.” Kärri had come out of a long-term relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious. “I was making the most of the dating scene and my independence,” she explains. In spring 2015, she started a new adventure. “I loved sailing, so I decided I was going to take part in the Clipper Round the World yacht race.”Kärri resigned from her job and packed her bags, ready to go back to her home country, Estonia, before she started training. “It was becoming clear that Mark and I would miss each other, and neither of us were sure if we’d see each other again,” she says. Shortly before she left, the two went for a final night out in central London, which ended in a goodnight kiss at Oxford Circus tube station. “It felt right,” says Mark. “Every time we’ve been through that station since, we always kiss in the same spot.”When Kärri was in Estonia, she invited Mark to come to stay. “I didn’t think he would come. Mark has eaten the same breakfast of poached eggs every day since 2008 – he’s not someone who ventures out of his comfort zone,” she jokes. But he couldn’t wait to see her. “I really liked her, so I thought: ‘Why not?’” The trip was derailed when one of Kärri friend’s was hospitalised, but Mark supported her. “I think that was a defining moment for us. He waited for me outside the hospital.”In July that year, Kärri returned to the UK for her training. “I asked whether I should stay with him and he admitted he had a date,” she laughs. Despite this, they met up a few days later, visiting a small town on the south coast together. “We’d been very casual, but for the first time we talked about where it was going,” explains Kärri. “I can’t remember the exact conversation now,” says Mark. “I think it was Kärri who suggested getting married. I just thought: yes! Let’s do it. I knew I had no interest in seeing anyone else. There wasn’t a flicker of doubt.”When Kärri left for her sea trip, being apart was challenging. “One day I was on the tube and I read that a sailor had been killed in a clipper accident,” says Mark. He had to wait until the next stop to refresh the page on his phone. “I was in tears trying to get the wifi working to make sure it wasn’t Kärri.” The couple communicated daily via the satellite device on the boat. “It was meant to be for short messages, but we sent long emails,” admits Kärri. “We had the chance to change our minds, but we never did. Mark collected all the emails when I got home and put them in a book.”They married in London when she returned in 2016 and Kärri got pregnant nine months later. “I was doing a job I loved, but we had to rethink our plans,” she says. After a visit to Estonia, they decided it would be the best place to raise their child.In January 2018, they welcomed their little girl into the family. Now firmly established in Estonia, Mark works as a product manager for a media company, while Kärri works in marketing for a bank. At the moment, the country is in lockdown and the pair are juggling work with childcare. “I think at the start we thought we’d have to drink every day,” laughs Kärri. “Now we’re wondering when it will end.”Despite the challenges, Mark says they are incredibly lucky. “I love that she always makes me think about what I am doing and why. I usually end up realising she’s right, too.

But that was before lockdown sent us back to our kitchens, and we became obsessed with bread.In theory, at least, you don’t need a machine to make a toastie, just two identical cast-iron frying pans. Heat both so they’re smoking hot, put the sandwich in one, and put the other one on top.But it’s easier with the right equipment. Toastie-makers have been around in some form for about a century, but the iconic brand, the Breville, launched in 1974 in Australia and sold 400,000 units in its first year, which at that time was everybody in the nation, even children. Kidding! Nonetheless, it was extremely popular. To taste one was to want a machine – such an elegant piece of engineering, bread crimped together, any filling – even beans – effortlessly held in place, a dainty scalloped pattern on each triangle.If you’re lucky enough to own a Breville, or one of the many rivals, there are a few rules. You can decide for yourself whether or not to butter the inside, but you have to butter the outside, quite heavily. You want it to turn into a little pie. And no fancy bread. Trish Hilferty, the chef-proprietor of the Canton Arms gastropub in London, learned that lesson a decade ago, when she took the toastie upmarket. “In the beginning,” she recalls, “we tried to get our bakers to make a sandwich loaf to fit, but it didn’t work. It needs to be plastic bread, medium cut so it’ll squish down.”These are the 10 best toasties of all time.The spring onion brings a splash of freshness to an otherwise head-turning furnace of pleasure. “It has to be quite a bitey cheddar,” Hilferty says, though she would use a comté or a Wensleydale on a wild day. She wouldn’t dream of using mozzarella. Some people put tomatoes in, but this is a terrible idea (they get too hot).The Canton’s signature toastie – it used to get through four or five large haggises a week, for 50 toasties. It has almost the right consistency – most meat ends up a bit too dry in a toastie – and where it’s not quite wet enough, that’s what brown sauce is for.Sorry to bang on about cheese, but without it the moisture in the ham absorbs into the bread, and you get quite a dry piece of meat with steamed toast around it. I mean, it’s not as disastrous as it sounds, but it’s not perfect.Do be careful, as the more liquid there is, the hotter it will get, and you can put your mouth out of action for a week if you attack it with too much enthusiasm. I would never put Worcestershire sauce on beans on toast, because it’s an interrupter. The extra crunch and fat of a toastie can take a bit of interruption. This is a great leftover use, as you always think you are going to eat them cold, but never do because they dry out. I would add mustard, but only afterwards, on a mouthful-by-mouthful basis.It sounds a bit unnecessarily fusion – why jalapeno? Why not an olive? – but feta is quite a different cheese proposition it doesn’t melt as such but takes on this exquisite crumbly softness. So you want it for the texture, but the taste is a bit in-your-face on its own, and an olive will just make it saltier. The chilli mixes it up a bit.The vegetarian’s conundrum is that very few vegetables will work raw in a toastie, either going limp (lettuce, peppers), getting too hot and unnatural (tomatoes, cucumbers) or simply being an offence to the tastebuds (avocado). And if you are going to the trouble of cooking a vegetable, that defeats the object, which is simplicity. However, if you have a Turkish corner shop, look for jars of spicy aubergine – it is magnificent in a sandwich (use olive oil rather than butter, though – brush on rather than drizzle).Again, peppers from a jar – don’t even think about roasting and skinning them yourself, or you will end up in salad territory and forget your mission. The anchovies can be any old anchovies, all of which are delicious. I wouldn’t put a sardine in a toastie, though – you need to be able to see what you’re dealing with.Cut the Snickers into half-centimetre slices or it won’t melt enough. Don’t overdo it on the Nutella or it will go everywhere. What am I talking about? It will go everywhere anyway. The problem is mainly conceptual – this is clearly a pudding, yet who eats a sandwich for pudding? Children get past this quite easily, thanks to the marvellous agility of their fresh minds.Mashed bananas on toast are quite a quaint, wartime snack, and great for your stockpile of almost-off bananas. In a toastie, they become something a bit fancier, more like a McDonald’s apple pie that tastes of banana."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d91933eb183091880419ce2e9b550558b641be4/0_0_5556_3709/master/5556.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=16c871bdd3bdae5a13700b85f068af66","title":"nina simone where to start in her back catalogue","story":"Our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the deft genius who raged searingly at injusticeNina Simone in Concert (1964)Nina Simone is in the unusual position of being a towering genius who never recorded an undeniable, canonical masterpiece. If you choose your 10 favourite songs, there’s a good chance that they’ll be from 10 different albums, which makes one of the many excellent compilations the natural gateway into a vast body of work that encompasses jazz, blues, folk, soul, pop, rock, show tunes, polyrhythms and songs that don’t even have genres.That said, In Concert, recorded at three Carnegie Hall shows during March and April 1964, represents her great leap forward as both a performer and activist: her escape from the “nothing world” of pop. She performs three songs from her jazzy 1959 debut Little Girl Blue with a newfound depth, drawn from painful personal experience and her recent political awakening at the hands of new friends in the civil rights movement, notably Lorraine Hansberry and James Baldwin. It’s this nightcrawling version of Jack Hammer’s Plain Gold Ring that explains why Nick Cave later covered it, while Don’t Smoke in Bed is so stark that you can hear audience members shifting in their seats.Unlike most live albums, In Concert leaves the audience in the mix throughout and illustrates how deftly Simone could snap between tension and release. Summoning the vengeful ghost of Brecht and Weill’s Pirate Jenny into the age of Medgar Evers and George Wallace, she stuns the room into a silence punctuated only by nervous coughs. During Go Limp, a kind of protester’s sex comedy written by CND campaigner Alex “The Joy of Sex” Comfort, the spectators chortle at the jokes, join in the goofy chorus and keep Simone airborne when she forgets the lyrics. The laughter carries into her own Mississippi Goddam – written in a frenzy hours after the 1963 Alabama church bombing – until the show-tune irony is burned away by a mounting rage that consumes the hall and you can hear in real time the realisation that they are listening to a protest song like none they’ve ever heard, owing more to cabaret than folk, and more to Malcolm X than Martin Luther King. Simone is fully aware of the power she wields: “Betcha thought I was kidding, didn’t you?” The final standing ovation is an explosion of awe and relief. Oh, to have been in that room.Wild Is the Wind (1966)Starting with I Put a Spell on You in 1965, you can’t go wrong with Simone’s final five albums for Philips Records. Despite being largely pieced together from leftover sessions by producer Hal Mooney, Wild Is the Wind is the strongest illustration of her uncanny ability to find the song within a song, revealing the secret tunnels and caverns that previous singers didn’t know existed and future interpreters couldn’t ignore. When Jeff Buckley covered the gloomy torch song Lilac Wine, he was really covering Simone’s version, which also happens to be one of Thom Yorke’s Desert Island Discs. Likewise, it was Simone who showed David Bowie that Johnny Mathis’s Wild is the Wind could be a shattering tour de force. Simone’s own Four Women, a quadripartite study of black womanhood so unflinching in its pain and outrage that some black radio stations banned it, epitomises her talent for inhabiting characters with her voice. It is practically a seance: each mistreated woman is sketched in just a few short lines but she lives and breathes and cries out for justice.Nina Simone and Piano! (1969)One of Simone’s 1969 albums for RCA was To Love Somebody, a pop-minded collection of handsomely arranged covers of Dylan, Cohen and the Bee Gees. The other was its polar opposite: Simone alone with the instrument she learned as a child. Her most intimate and auteurish album (she handled the occasional embellishments and overdubs as well) weaves erse material into a coherent suite of songs haunted by loneliness, depression and mortality. She makes Randy Newman’s I Think It’s Going to Rain Today bleaker still (“I hope it’s gonna rain today”), delivers Jacques Brel’s The Desperate Ones in a fraught whisper, rewrites the blues standard Nobody’s Fault But Mine and even renders Jonathan King’s mawkish Everyone’s Gone to the Moon unnervingly strange. Never has an exclamation mark been more inappropriate. This is a companion for the wee small hours.Around this time, Maya Angelou called Simone “an extremist, extremely realised”. Her last heavyweight artistic statement began at a show near Fort Dix, New Jersey, for Jane Fonda’s anti-war Free the Army tour in November 1971. George Harrison’s My Sweet Lord is a warm breeze but she whips it into a gospel hurricane and merges it with the Last Poets’ David Nelson’s biting poem Today Is a Killer, so that hope battles with despair on a cosmic scale. Running to almost 19 minutes, the medley is the most staggering spiritual crisis you will ever hear, whipped towards a chilling climax that brings the two strands together: “Today, who are you Lord? You are a killer!” Not yet done with Harrison, she spins Isn’t It a Pity out over 11 stark, disillusioned minutes, like a last call for humanity. “The times are desperate and America is one big emergency ward with everybody in the hospital,” Simone explained, not long before leaving “the United Snakes of America” for good.What might Simone have achieved in the 1970s had she not been derailed by deteriorating mental health, tax problems and self-imposed exile? Her fascination with West African polyrhythms was cut short but this radical interpretation of a Tina Turner song gives you a taste. Barely more than a sly, taunting vocal and feverish percussion, it signposts a road not taken.A Raised Voice by Claudia Roth PierpontPrompted by the controversial biopic Nina, this superb 2014 New Yorker article focuses on Simone’s role in the civil rights movement and the roots of her rage. “As the 60s progressed, the feelings she displayed – pain, lacerating anger, the desire to burn down whole cities in revenge – made her seem at times emotionally disturbed and at other times simply the most honest black woman in America.”What Happened, Miss Simone?Fortuitously released during the rise of Black Lives Matter, Liz Garbus’ taut 2015 Netflix documentary puts Simone’s radicalism into context. The talking heads are so-so but the archive footage is unmissable.Princess Noire: The Tumultuous Reign of Nina Simone by Nadine CohodasSimone’s slim 1991 memoir I Put a Spell on You left out a great deal. The best of the biographies fills in the gaps. Cohodas is particularly good at explaining what plagued Simone during her turbulent final decades, when her foes often included her own audiences.

Songs were interspersed with messages from actors such as Matthew McConaughey and Lupita Nyong’o, as well as other figures including Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.While the two-hour television broadcast portion – also screened by the BBC in the UK with additional performances from Paul McCartney, Tom Jones and more – was framed as a gift to essential workers, the preceding six hours invited donations, with the bulk of the cash coming from corporate sponsors. The WHO’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund will get $55.1m, while $72.8m will go to charities such as food banks and housing providers. The WHO fund is used to allocate tests and treatment, and to support development of a vaccine.Inevitably, the fundraising took on a political tinge, coming shortly after Donald Trump withdrew US funding for the WHO. Speaking to Variety, Hugh Evans, chief executive of Global Citizen, said: “It is not uncommon for world leaders of all stature to try to point fingers, because politics is in some instances about survival. And so I think that it’s not so surprising that it has become a political football. But I think that what we have to remember is that there’s no second World Health Organisation. There’s only one.”The show was well received, with Piers Morgan, who had previously criticised Lady Gaga’s involvement, apologising to her for his earlier comments. “This was a great initiative that raised a fortune, entertained people, \u0026amp will help save lives,” he tweeted. “It was also a perfect illustration of a major star using their profile properly in this crisis. Congrats \u0026amp sorry for originally questioning it.”Lady Gaga tweeted after the show: “Thank you with all of my heart for watching #TogetherAtHome, sharing in a global moment of kindness with each other, and spreading positive and loving intentions. We love you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e70cebea50acc9ab82989ca1caa26922d91b3f8f/0_43_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f76940d538c58892a04e7fac367e28d","title":"the best in culture under coronavirus lockdown podcast","story":"Three  critics – Ammar Kalia, Laura Snapes and Sian Cain – join Rachel Humphreys with a guide to the best of television, music and books under lockdown.

Theatre is such a commitment I need to be really picky. It’s a big deal, being out every night and away from family. The National came back with the idea of Malvolio and my interest was piqued. The director Simon Godwin and I read the play a lot together, just the two of us, and then with Ben Power, deputy artistic director at the NT, and then with a group of actors. But part of me was quite resistant. They said what about making the character Malvolia so you’re playing a woman? We did more workshops. I was very nervous of making Malvolio a woman and therefore a lesbian, considering what happens to the character in the play, which is monstrous.How did you balance the elements of comedy and cruelty?I wanted to find out more about the ridiculousness in Malvolia. Sometimes people develop coping strategies that make them foolish. Malvolia is a deeply wounded human being who becomes OCD and bullies the other people in the household in order to cope. She meets her match in Feste. I thought it was a brilliant idea to invite Doon Mackichan to play Feste and to make Fabian become Fabia. You’ve then got two more women who are the authors of the cruelty against Malvolia, alongside Maria. I thought that was interesting – there is so much cruelty against women perpetrated by women themselves. The self-judgment of women is awful. We started exploring what it was about Feste that enabled her to be so calculatedly and comically cruel to Malvolia.As Malvolia, you use precise hand gestures that tell us much about the characterIt’s an outward expression of her need to create order out of chaos. Hand gestures are often so much about threat and control. I trained as a dancer and am interested in what the whole body does. The way we express ourselves goes right to the very tips of our fingers. There is a moment when Malvolia comes on and tells Olivia there is a boy at the door who won’t go away. I started to use a repeated gesture of pushing him towards her. Then Phoebe Fox, as Olivia, says to tell him to go away and she repeats the gesture back. Malvolia gets rather confused about why Olivia is using that gesture so does it again. It became a beautiful moment.Malvolia’s judgment of the other characters extends towards the audience. How was that idea developed?I was overwhelmed by the size of the Olivier theatre, particularly in the letter scene which could be seen as a monologue. But I don’t think Shakespeare ever allows monologues to be internal. It’s a process of working out what you think about something in the company of 1,000 or so people in the audience. Who those people are is up to the actor to decide. I felt that Malvolia had a lot of internal voices which were powerful and controlling. So the audience embodied those internal voices and during the letter scene she is engaging with them to help her work out what this all means. I was afraid of it but the stage is so well designed to hold all of those people that it became weirdly intimate. The audience’s delight in the comic thrust of that scene encourages Malvolia. No internal voice stops her – there is no voice of reason.When I was reading the script I didn’t know how to pronounce “flough” in the letter. I said it in different ways to Simon and he laughed. Later he said: let’s keep that in – maybe Malvolia doesn’t know how to say it? Then I thought suppose one of the internal voices can help her pronounce it. Each night I elicited someone from the audience to tell me how to say it, so they are effectively egging her on in her belief. When, at the end, she says she will be revenged on the whole pack of them it’s Malvolia realising that no one was courageous enough to stop her and tell her she’s being ridiculous.For the NT Live filming, how do you modulate your usual stage performance?When we rehearsed for the NT Live version we did it without an audience and I fell apart – I couldn’t remember the lines. Malvolia works when she is in relationship to the audience rather than many of the other characters. A large part of the stalls was filled with camera equipment and it becomes difficult to engage with a body of people. It’s a bit like when I did Black Books, which was filmed in front of a live audience. It’s hard to know whether you’re playing to that number of people in the room or in a quiet way to the camera. You find a balance between the magnitude and the intimacy.In every Twelfth Night we await Malvolio’s yellow stockings scene. Yours becomes a cabaret-style showstopperIt’s such a hot moment in the play. At the time, a puritan coming on in yellow stockings would have been unbearably shocking. I thought in this hyperreal world, where she’s a woman, what would be shocking about her wearing yellow tights? So we needed to push it to find ultimate embarrassment. And because I have teenagers I thought what would upset them most to see me doing? I said to the designer Soutra Gilmour that this moment reminded me of popping corn: you have a dry kernel and you cook it in the pan with butter and it pops. Soutra created this amazing costume – she wanted Malvolia’s pierrot cape to look like a piece of popped corn. The composer Michael Bruce had written all this beautiful smooth jazz for the production – cool, melancholic, quite sexy. I told him we’ll need something for Malvolia’s number when she comes down the stairs in yellow stockings. I just meant a piece of music but Michael came in the next day and he’d put a Shakespeare sonnet to music. In one evening! He said: “Yeah, and you’re going to sing it!” Well, it would have been rude not to!What other Shakespeare parts are on your to-do list?I always used to say I didn’t want to play Lady Macbeth because I find it too frightening. She really faces the darkest part of herself. But I’d love to give that a go. I don’t want to be the go-to actor who plays traditionally male roles. But I do think Simon Godwin is on to something about the need to re-envision Shakespeare plays. You know how they did Frankenstein at the NT with two actors swapping roles? Wouldn’t it be interesting if you had male and female actors swapping Macbeth and Lady Macbeth?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5618ed266d001a0063bc417c3513887026557a29/89_170_4643_2786/master/4643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a95b2dc94a5d7ae18d96b9c954697d3","title":"oneplus 8 review 5g and top performance for less","story":"Large 90Hz screen, slick software, speed and strong battery life at a price that undercuts top rivalsOnePlus is back for 2020 with a revamped, lower-cost flagship phone with a slightly smaller 90Hz screen and 5G as standard.The £599 OnePlus 8 slides in under the £799 8 Pro, offering most of what you get on the firm’s top phone but in a smaller, more manageable package.On the outside the OnePlus 8 looks like 2019’s 7T Pro hit with a shrink ray and given a new paint job. Not that the phone is that small. It has a gorgeous 6.55in FHD+ AMOLED screen that is big by most standards, it is just not as massive as the super-sized variety. It runs at a 90Hz refresh rate too, which continues to be an excellent enhancement making all scrolling and animations a lot smoother than the previous 60Hz standard.A selfie camera peers through a hole in the screen in the top left corner. The rest of the device is the usual metal and glass sandwich with curved sides. It has a central triple-camera lump in the back, OnePlus’s excellent alert slider, power and volume buttons in the sides, and a USB-C port in the bottom, but no headphone socket.At 72.9mm wide the OnePlus 8 is one of the narrowest large-screen smartphones available, which with its relatively light 180g weight, makes it significantly easier to handle. For comparison, the OnePlus 7T is 1.5mm wider, Google’s Pixel 4XL is 2.2mm wider, Samsung’s Galaxy S20+ is 0.8mm wider and Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max is 4.9mm wider.At 160.2mm long and 8mm thick the OnePlus will fit in a pocket fairly easily. A good clear plastic case is included in the box, while a screen protector comes pre-applied.The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro are some of the first smartphones released in Europe to feature Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 865 processor, available with 8 or 12GB of RAM depending on storage version. It is 5G-capable by default and supports two sim cards at once.Performance all-round was nothing short of fantastic. OnePlus has made a name for itself with some of the fastest-feeling smartphones, and the 8 is no exception. Snappy, fluid, with no hint of lag or latency. It’s simply more responsive than anything else. Gaming performance was top notch too.Top performance is backed by solid battery life. The OnePlus 8 lasts more than 32 hours between charges, which is longer than its predecessor, making it from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two - enough for even the busiest of days.That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the screen set to 90Hz and on for well over five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, 50 minutes of video, plus seven hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos.One caveat: it was impossible to test the effects of 5G on battery life during lockdown in the UK as I do not currently receive coverage at home. 5G performance on Vodafone and EE, however, was similar to the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra when tested during a grocery run. It’s worth noting that, pending a software update, the phone is limited to 4G-only when two sims are used at the same time.The 8 ships with OxygenOS 10.5 based on Android 10, which continues to be one of the best implementations of Android available on any device.New for this year is the addition of Google’s Discover feed on the home screen, replacing the less-than-loved “Shelf” alternative. Other nice touches include the ability to choose which icons show in the status bar, full theme support, including a dark-mode theme, choices for animations such as that around the fingerprint scanner and the ability to trigger Google Assistant by pressing and holding the power button.Overall OxygenOS continues to provide plenty of customisation and power-user features without clutter or slowdown.OnePlus offers software support for at least three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bi-monthly schedule. Updates to new versions of Android are fairly fast post-release by Google too.The OnePlus 8 has a triple-camera system on the rear of the device, combining a 48-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 5-megapixel macro camera.The main 48MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default, producing some great-looking images in good lighting, while the auto-HDR mode handles high-contrast scenes well. It stumbles a bit in middling conditions, such indoor lighting, losing detail in textures and struggling with white balance. Low-light performance is not fantastic, although OnePlus’s Nightscape mode helps. A 48MP mode is also available, but I generally got better results without it.There’s no telephoto camera, which is a shame, instead a 2x zoom button in the camera app is a digital zoom, which works pretty well at low magnifications, but is full of artefacts anywhere approaching its 10x max.The 16MP ultrawide angle camera is fun and does a good job of capturing a wide scene, but was a little bleached and soft on detail in bright light, handling better in less sunny scenes and indoors during the day.The 5MP macro camera is garbage. I take quite a lot of macro photography and got much better results using the main camera, which can focus fairly close to the lens, and then zooming in a little bit.The front-facing 16MP camera is fixed-focus but is really good, producing highly detailed and well toned skin in images in good light. It gets slightly softer in poor light, but still very respectable.The OnePlus 8 is a great phone at a good price, particularly when you consider you’re getting 5G flagship performance at £599, which undercuts rivals such as Samsung’s Galaxy S20 by about £300.You get a smartphone experience that’s second to none. Always fast, always fluid and with a level of software refinement few others manage. The 6.55in 90Hz screen is bright and slick, while the narrow width and relatively light weight make the OnePlus 8 one of the easiest big-screen phones to use on a day-to-day basis.The battery outlasts even the most intense days, while it charges super fast and has modes to help increase battery longevity. The main camera is good for the money too.Corners have been cut to reach the mid-range price, including a telephoto camera and wireless charging. While three years of software support might be fairly standard for Android devices, Samsung offers four and Apple offers at least five, so there’s still work to be done.Overall the OnePlus 8 offers a lot of phone for the money in a manageable size, making it the very best lower-cost 5G device released so far.Cons: no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, 5G disabled when using two sims, no formal IP rating, only three years software updates This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

I plan to walk past sacks of spices and dyes, piles of green mint as high as a door lintel, and sweet fried bouchnikhas, and find a place to stand with my back against the wall, out of the way of bicycles and the madly confident teenagers on scooters, and watch hundreds of people go by.I have always been in awe of the way the scooters don’t collide (or at least, don’t collide much): I want to see seas of people – tourists and merchants and children – dodge each other and step on each other’s toes, and laugh it off and surge on. I plan to admire the many different shades of people’s eyes, and the varieties of teeth, and the unassailable beauty of the human body in motion. I hope to find the collective of women selling argan oil scented with orange blossom, and buy five bottles, and to go about for weeks smelling of a greenhouse. My home during isolation has no heating, so I I dream of large skies and of the ferocity of the sun.Fifteen miles from Marrakech is a Berber village, and on the outskirts is a riad called Tigmi, a hotel at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The walls are built of rough, uneven stone, the bathrooms are plastered in cool tadelakt, and there is bougainvillea everywhere. There are goats which pass by and occasionally lick the front door handle in search of salt. Best of all, there are dozens of tortoises in the garden, which butt their heads hopefully against your feet at breakfast, and chew lightly at your hair if you lie on the grass.I envy those goats and tortoises. I miss the days when I could have licked the door handles with relative bacterial if not social impunity. Why did I not lick door handles all day long while I could? I wish I had known what I had while I had it: I would have chewed lightly on strangers’ eyebrows on the Northern Line. I always thought I was good at cherishing the luck I have had - it turns out I was not cherishing hard enough.

Citing an internal document, the paper reported that Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, planned to make a formal proposal to his EU colleagues during a summit on Thursday.The global number of deaths has topped 165,000 with more than 2.4m confirmed cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, US deaths passed 40,000 on Sunday – nearly a quarter of the global total – with almost 760,000 infections, or just under a third of the world’s total. Spain has reported 399 coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, lower than Sunday’s figure of 410 and confirming the downward trend. A total of 20,852 people have died of the disease in Spain.Donald Trump was accused of using another White House coronavirus briefing to broadcast a “campaign ad”, in which the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise. The US president dimmed the lights and played two selectively edited videos on screens behind the briefing room podium featuring Cuomo, whose state has been hardest hit by the deadly pandemic in the US.Sir Richard Branson has warned that the survival of his Virgin Atlantic airline depends on it receiving UK government support. It has been reported that the carrier is asking for up to £500m of public money. The Virgin Group boss wrote in a blog post: “Together with the team at Virgin Atlantic, we will do everything we can to keep the airline going – but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for.”Several countries began to ease their lockdown restrictions. Australians returned to the beach in Sydney but only for exercise. India allowed some industrial and agricultural firms to reopen, while Iran opened some shopping malls and intercity highways.A Japanese specialist in infectious diseases has said he is “very pessimistic” about the likelihood of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead next year.

People will be coming from hundreds of nations ... and although Japan might have the disease under control by next summer, I don’t think that will be the case everywhere.”New Zealand’s prime minister has extended the country’s level-four lockdown for a week, after which schools and daycare centres will be allowed to open, as well as some businesses. Speaking in Wellington, Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand was in with a fighting chance of eliminating the disease, and the number of deaths was low enough that she still received a phone call for each one. “We have done what very few countries have been able to do.

As society embraces “virtual” living, disabled people – who for years have missed out due to poor access – are suddenly finding themselves able to take part in work, culture, or socialising from their own home.Nicola Welsh, 43, has always loved going to museums but a painful nerve condition means she’s been housebound for 17 years. As cultural institutions including the National Theatre and the Royal Opera House go online, she’s been able to tour the world visiting museums.Brian Spalding, 47, who has been on bed rest for four years with spina bifida, can now socialise with his friends online. “Since lockdown I have actually felt better about my situation, given all of society now experiencing a form of ‘bed rest’,” he said. Spalding, who lives in Argyll, Scotland, is even giving advice to loved ones on how to cope with isolation when they feel anxious or stressed. “I’m finding my community, for so long seeming so much further away, is now literally so much closer to home.”For others, lockdown has seen career doors open. Laura Elliott, in Sheffield – who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects connective tissue, and ME – has always wanted to be a writer. The 28-year-old has been mostly housebound since 2016 and has had a few short stories published in magazines, whilst plugging away at a novel.“For years, I’ve been looking wistfully at Penguin’s Write Now scheme, which provides potential year-long support for under-represented writers trying to break into the industry, including those with disabilities. Sadly, they’ve always required physical attendance at workshops before,” she said. But because of coronavirus, suddenly the scheme will be conducted online. It means for the first time, Elliot was able to send in an application. “It’s entirely possible I won’t be selected – but at least now I’ll know, instead of being prevented from even giving it a try.”Last week, churches and cathedrals across the UK broadcast Easter services online, with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, speaking from his kitchen using an iPad. Karin Turner, 42, who has a brain injury and broken ankle, is now able to “go to church” online with her pastor in his living room.“I had been missing the feeling of community. Being able to listen to my pastor preach, hear stories about what is happening in the wider community and have some leadership has made the difference,” she said. “Of course, you can pray and have faith at home, but a big part of Christianity is community and it is difficult to feel cut off from that.”Even healthcare has opened up disabled people who have long campaigned to see their doctors virtually, report they are now being offered Skype time with consultants.As well as joy at being offered new opportunities, many feel frustrated that it took the non-disabled world to become house-bound before access was granted. Emma Duke, 21, who has Pots syndrome – which results in an abnormally increased heart rate after sitting up or standing – and neurological problems, has been trying to get remote access to film classes for her degree for the last three years in Los Angeles. She was frequently refused – “I was told it wasn’t ‘feasible’” – but the coronavirus pandemic means her entire university is now online.Rather than “more” opportunities opening up, 30-year-old Tom Staniford in Exeter describes the phenomenon as a levelling of the playing field. “I find it infuriating to see people moaning about reduced mobility, challenges of remote working, fear of illness risk, long periods of isolation – all things many disabled people already endure on a daily basis,” said Staniford, who has the rare MDP syndrome, which leaves him with physical and auditory disabilities. He thinks the lockdown could open up the chance for permanent accessibility. “But my overriding suspicion is it will be a massive missed opportunity.”Turner is more hopeful. “I feel like people are finally understanding the physical barriers disabled people face,” she said. “I’m actually really optimistic good will come out of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbc8b6e6049d420c7bce1f344ea012fca586546/304_5_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d13e1f3bdecc492c01dee0fd166a3e47","title":"kim yo jong the sister of kim jong un fast becoming his alter ego","story":"The North Korean leader’s trusted propagandist-in-chief is in the ascendancyFrom producing an ashtray during a cigarette break en route to a nuclear summit to issuing a statement in praise of the US president, Kim Yo-jong has become the single most important figure in the North Korean regime after her brother, the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.Since representing Kim at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Yo-jong has not only acquired prestigious titles within the ruling Workers’ party. She is rumoured to be the brains behind Kim’s carefully constructed public image, at home and abroad. In return, she enjoys the absolute confidence of her brother, a leader capable of ordering the execution of his own uncle for alleged treason.As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic – with Pyongyang continuing to insist it has not recorded a single case – Kim Yo-jong’s ascendancy continues.Last month, she made her first public statement, condemning the South as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North. And in March, she publicly praised Donald Trump for sending Kim a letter in which he said he hoped to maintain good bilateral relations and offered help in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.The publication of political statements in Kim Yo-jong’s name underlines her central role in the regime, according to Youngshik Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It is revealing that Kim Jong-un permitted her to write and announce a scathing statement about South Korea in such a personal tone,” Bong said. “He is clearly ready to allow his sister to become his alter ego.”But Yo-jong, who accompanied Kim to his two summits with Trump, apparently paid a price when his nuclear diplomacy suffered a setback. Last weekend, she was reinstated to the party’s powerful politburo, according to the state Korean Central News Agency, just over a year after she had reportedly been removed from the position and told to keep a low profile following the failure of the Hanoi denuclearisation summit.And she has not escaped the attention of US officials, who in 2017 placed her and other North Korean officials on a blacklist for “severe human rights abuses”.Internationally, Yo-jong has been a visible presence throughout the regime’s high-stakes diplomatic process with Washington and Seoul. At home, she has performed the role of propagandist-in-chief, burnishing Kim’s reputation as head of the dynasty that has ruled North Korea for three generations.“She has direct access to and strong influence on Kim Jong-un,” said Leonid Petrov, a North Korea specialist and senior lecturer at the International College of Management in Sydney. “She is not associated with his purges or military brinkmanship, but knows all about them. She is a trusted political figure who helps Kim maintain a positive public image when he is dealing with foreigners or South Koreans.”Yo-jong, who is thought to be four years younger than her brother, was rarely seen in public until 2010, when she was photographed attending a party conference. By the following year, she was a regular presence in her father Kim Jong-il’s entourage, and was seen mourning after his death in late 2011.But her journey to the heart of the North Korean regime had arguably begun in the late 1990s, when she attended primary school in Berne, Switzerland at the same time as Kim Jong-un, with whom she lived in a private home, attended to by staff and watched over by bodyguards, according to North Korea Leadership Watch.“They were virtually in exile together, both knowing what the future had in store for them,” Bong said. “They must have gained a tremendous sense of having a common fate. As a result, she has her brother’s unconditional trust.”Little is known about Yo-jong’s life during the period between her graduation with a computer science degree from Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang and 2007, when she began to play a junior role in the ruling party.She is said to have been involved in arranging her brother’s succession as supreme leader after Kim Jong-il suffered two strokes in 2008, but was not mentioned by North Korean state media until March 2014, when she accompanied her brother during elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly.“The North Korean regime is a family business, and Kim Jong-un appears to place trust in his sister,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul. “She has demonstrated skills at modernising the brand of the regime, and has some sway over state propaganda. Her most important function is probably as a confidante to her brother.“But she also has a signalling role because messages from Kim Yo-jong carry more weight than those of an imminently replaceable North Korean official.”Kim Yo-jong’s upward trajectory is expected to continue once the North resumes its nuclear diplomacy in a post-pandemic world. “She plays a pivotal role in North Korean domestic and foreign policy campaigns because she is one of the main stakeholders in the regime’s survival,” Petrov said.But, he added, she would never adopt the mantle of leader should something happen to her brother. “Kim Yo-jong knows how to smooth Kim Jong-un’s initiatives and strengthen his soft power … but she won’t replace the primary decision-maker. North Korea is a Confucian country where seniority and masculinity are respected. She is Kim’s most trusted ally, but no more than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c40442d0505b3eb492eec9387cc2b905be3a6dd8/1188_397_3378_2027/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5494cd1569c1a420e1ab85241123c1","title":"new zealand plans to ease coronavirus lockdown in a week","story":"Jacinda Ardern says: ‘We have done what very few countries have been able to do. We have stopped a wave of devastation’New Zealanders will remain in total lockdown for another week, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said, with restrictions easing if elimination progress is maintained.Speaking at the Beehive in Wellington, Ardern said New Zealand was in with a fighting chance of eliminating the disease, and the number of deaths was low enough that she still received a phone call for each one.“We have done what very few countries have been able to do. We have stopped a wave of devastation,” Ardern said.“Our transmission rate, the number of cases each person with the virus passes it onto, is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas the average is 2.5 people. We have amongst the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world.”The prime minister said New Zealand had a “relatively low proportion of serious cases”, and according to the Oxford University coronavirus government response tracker, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.Overall 1,400 people have become infected with coronavirus in New Zealand, and 12 people have died, all older people with pre-existing health conditions. On Monday, nine new cases were confirmed by the Ministry of Health, but random testing of 1,000 people in the community had returned no positive results.“Nearly every case identified since April 1 is as a result of overseas travel or contact with someone with the virus, often in existing clusters,” Ardern said. “Our testing has scaled up and we have now tested over 85,000 New Zealanders, one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world.”The director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said he was confident community transmission of the virus has not taken hold, but he, and other experts advising the government, had urged them to extend the level four lockdown, to be “extra safe” and solidify the gains already made in lowering infection rates.The government’s decision to conditionally ease restrictions from next Monday night has taken a middle path between those urging an immediate end to lockdown for the sake of the gasping economy, and those urging an extension to give the elimination strategy a fighting chance.Moving to level three overnight on Monday would see many more businesses able to trade, including those involved in takeaways and food deliveries, the construction sector and the forestry sector. The move to level three would have significant benefits for the economy, Ardern said.Social lives would largely be unchanged however, with Kiwis still urged to remain at home unless taking exercise or fetching supplies. “Bubbles” could be marginally expanded, however, to include close family or those who might be alone or isolated in the community, she said. Schools would be open, but students should remain at home, if they could.Cabinet would make a decision whether level three lockdown would move to two on 11 May.New Zealand entered lockdown on 25 March, when there were fewer than 150 cases of the virus and no deaths.Lockdown has been widely complied with countrywide, despite stringent regulations, which have dictated Kiwis stay in their homes around the clock unless shopping for essentials such as food or medicine, or taking a brief respite of exercise within their neighbourhood.The first two weeks of lockdown saw widespread confusion as to what and wasn’t permitted, and the health minister David Clark was demoted after flouting the rules and taking his family to a beach 20km from their home.There have been some isolated reports of lockdown parties, but overall police have praised Kiwis adherence to the rules.New Zealand is pursuing an elimination strategy and is one of few worldwide to do so, but has advantages in being able to completely shut down its borders, having a small number of cases, and cities that are not so densely packed as the likes of New York and London.Epidemiologists working on New Zealand’s Covid-15 strategy urged the prime minister to stay the course and choose the conservative path, saying if the country came out of lockdown too soon, months of good work would be lost.Scientist Dr Michelle Dickinson, who participated in a press conference for children with the prime minister, praised the government’s decision.“While other countries show no sign of any control of Covid-19 I’m so proud of NZ \u0026amp what we’ve done as a nation,” Dickinson said on Twitter.“We had some of the toughest lockdown rules in the world, but today we can be optimistic about coming out of it on Monday \u0026amp feeling safe that this is the right decision”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598255b183faf27db780af45cdba8b3ee439e62c/0_86_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad1f939ef53a1346f8b19df0c4487354","title":"people have been awakened seeking covid 19 answers in wuhan","story":"Residents are looking for an explanation from the government about its handling of coronavirusby  Lily Kuo in WuhanIn early January, Hu Aizhen, 65, heard that a new coronavirus had emerged in her home city, Wuhan. She was not worried – officials said it was not contagious – so she went about her days as usual and prepared for the lunar new year at the end of the month.Just before the city was put under lockdown, Hu developed pneumonia symptoms. After days of waiting and searching for a hospital, she was tested for the virus. Her result was negative, but tests at the time were known to be inaccurate and she showed obvious signs of the virus. Nevertheless, she was refused treatment by six hospitals.Hu, who had always been healthy, stayed at home for 10 days, unable to drink or eat, while her health deteriorated. When she took a further turn for the worse, her son tried to get her to a hospital in another district but police stopped them. Under lockdown orders they could not cross into another district. Her son, desperate, shouted at the traffic officers: “Are you not people?”When Hu was finally admitted to a hospital on 8 February, she was struggling to breathe. The doctor ordered another test, but it was too late. She regained consciousness briefly, asking her son to pour her some water. Then she died.Hu’s son is now suing the Wuhan municipal government for allegedly concealing the seriousness of the virus, among other complaints, according to court documents prepared by Funeng, a public welfare NGO based in Changsha. Hu’s son is among a small but significant group of residents seeking answers, compensation or simply an apology from officials who took weeks to notify the public of the threat from a virus that went on to claim the lives of at least 4,000 people in China, according to government figures, most of them in Wuhan.Other cases include a civil servant suing the Hubei provincial government, a mother petitioning for officials to be punished after watching her 24-year-old daughter die of the virus, and a son who rushed his quickly fading mother to a hospital in the suburbs of Wuhan where he was able to get her admitted to intensive care. When he went to pick up supplies for her, he received a phone call from the hospital. His mother had died.“None of this would have happened if they had told us. So many people would not have had to die,” said a relative involved in one of the lawsuits. Another said: “I want an answer. I want those responsible to be punished under the law.”As the outbreak spread in China, with thousands of confirmed cases a day at its peak, public anger reached levels not seen in decades, posing a serious threat to the ruling Chinese communist party. When the whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang died from the virus in February, censors could not keep up with the flood of outrage online. It was a moment some compared to the outpouring over the death of Hu Yaobang that precipitated the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.A little more than two months on, the resentment is much less visible. Accounts like Hu Aizhen’s have been replaced by positive stories of the country coming together to defeat the virus, sending needed supplies to the rest of the world and fighting malicious attacks from the US and other countries blaming Beijing for the outbreak.“People are easily led by propaganda,” said Shi, a human rights activist based in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. “As the epidemic situation has improved and the propaganda machine works, there has been a reversal. Now people are saying the strong leadership of the party is a good thing.”As Wuhan and the rest of the country slowly return to normal, authorities are carefully monitoring those who might harbour resentment. Zhang Hai, 50, whose father died from the virus in February, was part of a WeChat group of more than 100 people who lost relatives to the virus.In late March they were told they could retrieve their loved ones’ remains from funeral homes. No more than five could go together at one time, and they had to be accompanied by a local government representative. Zhang refused to go. Later, the group’s host was called in by the police and the WeChat group was deleted.“Now everyone is trying to be very careful,” said Zhang, who is calling for the government to issue an apology. “I know a lot of families who are incredibly angry.”Tan Jun, a civil servant in Yichang in Hubei province, filed a complaint this month accusing the Hubei provincial government of concealing the outbreak, according to copies of the lawsuit posted online. Tan confirmed the lawsuit but declined to be interviewed. Other residents in Wuhan who spoke to the  said they had been intimidated by local police and forced to promise not to speak out.“People must take responsibility. As a resident of Hubei, I believe it is necessary to stand up and call on the Hubei government to take responsibility,” Tan said, according to an article posted on several WeChat accounts that has now been deleted.While authorities in Beijing have punished local officials by replacing them – what observers say is an age-old tactic for deflecting blame from the central government – residents say this is not enough.“That is not accountability. That is switching hats,” said Wu, 49, who says she contracted the virus in January but was not officially diagnosed until March. In hospital she watched people around her die, including a woman in the next bed. Recently she learned that a classmate of hers who got sick around the same time had passed away.“When I was laying in bed thinking I might soon die, I thought: how did this happen?” said Wu, who is suing her hospital for not confirming her as a coronavirus patient when she was released. “Regular people have limited access to real information. We rely on the government. We believe what the government says.”Dissent has spread in other ways. Dozens of shop owners at a shopping mall in Wuhan demonstrated this month, demanding rent reductions after months of not being able to open their stores. In Yingcheng, a city west of Wuhan, residents put under lockdown protested against the high prices for food imposed by community management. One of the protesters, Zeng Chunzhi, has reportedly been detained.“People have been awakened. That’s for sure,” said Xie Yanyi, a rights lawyer based in Beijing. Xie has filed a request for information from the government, including the origins of the virus and reasons for the delay in informing the public of the outbreak. “It may not be many people, but history shows that it is the few who change society and who change history,” Xie said.In Wuhan, most residents are relieved that the worst of the epidemic appears to be over as they watch other countries struggle to contain it. Employees wait in lines outside of office buildings to have their throats swabbed, to make sure they do not have the virus before going back to work.On the riverbank in Hankou district, a couple kiss in front of what has become a nightly light show of skyscrapers lit up with congratulatory messages. Many residents say they appreciate what their country has done for them.The chance that cases such as Hu’s will be accepted and go to court are not high, according to Yan Zhanqing, a co-founder of Funeng. More likely, those involved will be intimidated or harassed. But in some cases, especially determined plaintiffs can get compensation, which is one form of apology.“These cases apply pressure on the government and help more people understand their rights and the government’s responsibility,” Yan said. “This is also a way of documenting history, letting more people know the truth, and not just the government’s version of what happened in Wuhan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d012799383ed43e64981895027e0ae0d6d81ba/0_473_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1b0355f86619355bd4a5b476cf8a09","title":"premier foods sales surge amid lockdown demand for store cupboard staples coronavirus covid 19 mr kipling","story":"Mr Kipling producer, Premier Foods, has reported a sales surge as the coronavirus lockdown drives demand for store cupboard items.Premier Foods said during “this challenging time” its manufacturing and distribution were working at “maximum capacity” and demand continued to be high.Each factory worker had been given two additional days of annual leave and a £250 cash bonus.The company added: “Volumes have started to reduce from the exceptional levels seen in March, although are still expected to continue to be higher than average patterns of demand.“This reflects more meals being eaten at home than usual due to recent measures set out by the government, and hence increased demand for the group’s product ranges.”It comes on the back of surging supermarket sales over the past month, as shoppers have stocked up on essentials.Premier Foods made the announcement as it revealed a major shake-up of its pension schemes, following a year-long strategic review at the business.It said this would involve a merger of its three separate pension schemes and would reduce the cash contributions from the group, as Premier looks to save money.The debt-laden business has come under fire from activist investors in recent years, resulting in a leadership shake-up last year.Premier said it expected to post a trading profit for the year ending 28 March at the “top end of market expectations” following a strong March period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/195d6202ec0e000c2a833922a798e6b91fce8e24/0_37_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb042bbe17b0d591483ef89ae5a8501","title":"us scuppers g20 coronavirus statement on strengthening who","story":"Exclusive: objections leave health ministers unable to agree joint communique on cooperation US hostility to the World Health Organization scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO’s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic.In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics.The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and China in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides.Donald Trump has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body’s China-centric approach, reflected – in his view – by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for Saudi Arabia, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting.A six-paragraph statement made no mention of the WHO, but referred to systemic weaknesses in the way in which the world handled pandemics.However, an unpublished 52-paragraph draft communique supported and committed to further strengthening the WHO’s mandate in coordinating the fight against the pandemic, including the protection of frontline health workers and delivery of medical supplies, especially diagnostic tools, medicines and vaccines.The draft also expressed “concern about the continuity and lack of sustainable funding” of the WHO’s health emergencies programme. It urged all donors to invest in the fund, saying “it is far more cost effective to invest in sustainable financing for country preparedness than to pay to the costs of responding to outbreaks”.Several days before the meeting it had emerged that the US health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, would not be attending as scheduled. Other attendees said they understood that Trump did not want him to participate. Instead, the US was represented by Eric Hargan, Azar’s deputy, and another US official.Sherpas for other delegations were also made aware before the meeting of US objections to language relating to the WHO, which was supported by the 19 other countries.According to those present, many of the representatives at the meeting spoke of the key role being played by the WHO and praised the value of the guidance it has issued during the outbreak.Sources said that some representatives also made the point that any inquest into the handling of the pandemic by the WHO – as demanded by the Trump administration – should wait until after the pandemic was brought under control.When the US delegation’s turn came to speak, Hargan explained that the US “could not endorse” the declaration, instead suggesting that a summary be issued in the form of a press release. The bulk of the draft communique constituted a call for countries to cooperate multilaterally to prevent future pandemics, highlighting the current inequality in health resources and the human suffering the pandemic was causing.The draft contained no implicit or explicit criticism of China’s initial handling of the crisis, saying instead all sides were committed to learning lessons from the crisis, including the vulnerabilities exposed by the global response.Donald Trump last week suspended US payments to the WHO claiming the organisation was too “China-centric” and accused its leadership of failing to alert the world to the scale of the pandemic that began in Wuhan until it was too late.The WHO has insisted it acted as soon as it had information from Beijing and stated that it needed Chinese support to gain access to China, and investigate the issue of human-to-human transmission.The US has previously prevented the G7, a smaller group of mainly western industrialised countries, from reaching a joint position when foreign ministers were unable to agree with a US insistence that the virus be described as the “Wuhan virus”.The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded on the 7 April 1948, a date celebrated annually as World Health Day. As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIVAIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\u0026nbspWHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus.The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia’s minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country’s health system.WHO\u0027s handling of the global pandemic has been criticised by US president Donald Trump, who announced in April that the US will no longer contribute to funding the agency.Saudi Arabia is this year’s chair of the G20, and the main summit of world leaders is still scheduled to be held in Riyadh in November. In the run-up to that event specialist ministers meet to prepare parts of the final communique.The US is the second largest contributor to the WHO, and the sudden suspension of US payments for up to 90 days has infuriated other nations’ health ministries, while easing some of the pressure on China over its handling of the crisis. The Trump administration has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7738daa1ba8449c8ff24d4219f5464664c744bb9/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd0ca8e0f52b12338ae4121008a2dfa","title":"my shrunken world lockdown in camden in pictures","story":"Challenging herself to see her immediate environment in a new way, photographer Sarah Lee, who has been on complete lockdown for over four weeks, shot these images on an iPhone within a one-mile radius of her home in Camden Town, north London"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, visitors from outside the area have been warned to stay away from the causeway coast. Photograph:  Margaret McLaughlinIreland may have to cope with repeated waves of Covid-19 epidemics until a large enough proportion of the population is infected to provide possible herd immunity, new research warns.At best, there may be three more cycles of infection before 60 per cent of the population have the virus, regarded as sufficient to provide potential herd immunity, according to the modelling analysis led by an Irish scientist at King’s College London.However, it could take up to nine further waves of infection – and ensuing lockdowns – before possible herd immunity is reached, under a second model developed by Dr Rosalyn Moran and her fellow researchers.The issue of herd immunity has been the subject of intense debate however during the Covid-19 pandemic with WHO epidemiologists warning in recent days that there was no proof yet that having had a coronavirus infection will confer immunity for a significant period of time.The current outbreak in Ireland is peaking around now, according to the King’s College analysis, which estimates the eventual cumulative death toll at between 1,008 and 1,250.Dr Moran emphasises there is “nothing set in stone” about the modelling predictions made in the research which, she says, shows the need for Ireland to replicate South Korean levels of testing for the virus and contact tracing for known cases.The number of deaths and confirmed cases reported in the Republic on Sunday both showed a slight decline on recent days. Another 39 people died from Covid-19, while there were a further 493 confirmed cases of the virus, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said.There have now been 610 Covid-19-related deaths in the State, while the number of confirmed cases stands at 15,251.Air of complacencyMinister for Health Simon Harris said on Sunday night he feared an air of complacency was “creeping in” in relation to Ireland’s battle against Covid-19 which has to be pushed back against. “We are making really good progress ... but the progress is fragile. We are in a very delicate moment and it would not take much for that to be reversed,” he said.He appealed to people not to become relaxed about the restrictions. “Now is not the time for complacency ... that would be disastrous, it could potentially be fatal,” he added.All but two of the deaths reported on Sunday were in the east of the country.Dr Moran’s research suggests somewhere between 6.5 per cent and 16.7 per cent of the Irish population will have been affected by the current epidemic of coronavirus, and therefore may enjoy some immunity from the disease. In the UK, where 50,000 deaths are forecast by the research, it is estimated 19.6 per cent will have been affected by its outbreak.The research, which looked at the number of “lockdown cycles” that may be needed in seven European countries, says a large proportion of the total population in each country will remain without immunity after the current wave of infection. “This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely. These findings may have implications for ‘exit strategies’ from any lockdown stage.”Eliminated backlogThe Health Service Executive said yesterday it has eliminated the backlog of people waiting for Covid-19 tests. It said 27 laboratories, including one in Germany, are now processing 10,000 test results a day.Over the weekend, 4,000 staff and residents in nursing homes were tested as part of a heightened response by the HSE to escalating cases and deaths in the sector. The number of outbreaks or suspected outbreaks in long-term residential care facilities now stands at 248, according to the HSE.Meanwhile, the biggest teachers’ union in the State has warned the health and safety of pupils and teaching staff must be guaranteed before any decision is taken to reopen primary schools.The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) was responding to comments by Mr Harris, who raised the possibility of a partial reopening of schools at the weekend.If schools do reopen it could be on the basis of a day a week, the Minister suggested.But last night Mr Harris said: “We are going to have this virus with us for a long time. I don’t expect a light switch moment on the 5th of May where restrictions which are in place are all of a sudden reversed.”Meanwhile Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was due to receive on Sunday night the results of a review into the rules around foreign workers and travel.Bulgarian workersMr Varadkar ordered the review after fruit producer Keelings flew almost 200 Bulgarians into Ireland to\u0026nbspwork on its farms.The 189 workers arrived into Dublin on a chartered aircraft last week to carry out seasonal work on Keelings fruit farms. It is understood that a series of options will be presented in the paper which will then be considered by the Cabinet Covid 19 committee on Monday. A Government source said the issue was “difficult” as the workers could be considered essential workers, but concerns remained about the safety of the travel arrangements.Sources said one option that is likely to be considered on foot of the review is checking in on those who travel into Ireland to ensure that they remain in isolation for the designated 14 day period.There are now more than 2.3 million cases of coronavirus around the world and more than 160,000 deaths, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University.

There are five Irish people still on the ship, four members of the band Emerald Tide and an engineer.The passengers of the cruise ship got word on March 16th that the prime minister of New Zealand was closing the ports and no longer allowing ships to enter the country, which resulted in the ship making a three-day voyage back to Sydney, where 2,700 passengers disembarked on March 19th.“On March 20th, we got word that there were positive cases on board, so we were quarantined and isolated here then on March 21st,” Ms Heneghan said on the Late Late Show on Friday night.The Ruby Princess cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been docked at Port Kembla in New South Wales since and has been linked to hundreds of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia and about a third of the country’s reported deaths.The violinist and harpist described her situation as a “huge scandal”. Speaking to the talk show host Ryan Tubridy, Ms Heneghan said her contract as a musician aboard the cruise ship was due to finish on April 4th, but she remains unaware to date of when she and the other band members will be allowed to disembark from the ship.“It’s a big political game of chess at the moment,” Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy, regarding the police investigation into whether there was criminal negligence in the handling of the health issues on the cruise ship.“We’re just pawns in this big political game and kind of forgotten about until decisions are made and we get news that we can disembark and get repatriated home.”“We were told via intercom by the hotel general manager, who updates us daily, that there was a possibility of us going to Manila to let off the Filipino crew. One of our sister ships is outside Manila and the Philippines won’t let them port. We also heard through the media that we might be going to the United States, which would be disastrous for us because we don’t have visas,” she said.Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy that her “one wish” for the four Irish in her band and the fifth Irish citizen on board is “to get off this boat before it sails away”.Despite the situation, the young woman was in good spirits and said “structure and routine” have been “absolutely vital in maintaining a bit of sanity”.

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that the Government will examine how it can get Irish workers to fill seasonal jobs such as fruit pickers and agricultural workers.Speaking in Dublin on Monday morning, Mr Varadkar agreed that agriculture workers were deemed to be essential workers, but said “I have to say when we deemed agriculture workers to be essential workers, I hadn’t envisaged hundreds of agricultural workers coming in from outside the country.”He said that the Government would work with the sector “to see if we can find an adequate number of Irish people or people resident in Ireland at the very least who will take up those positions”.If not, Mr Varadkar said, “we have to take a decision: do we allow the crop to fail, which isn’t a good thing, or do we allow workers to continue to come in from other parts of the EU but with very defined and monitored quarantine arrangements.”Mr Varadkar said that the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 would meet on Monday to discuss nursing homes, testing and foreign travel, especially whether to continue to allow foreign agricultural workers to arrive in Ireland.“We need to keep our airports open, we need to keep our ports open,” Mr Varadkar said. “We need essential workers to be able come in and out . . . but we also make sure it’s done in such a way as minimises the risk of the transmission of the virus. And that means asking people to self-isolate, to self-restrict their movements for 14 days - that has been done since the very start of this outbreak but what we’re looking at now is are the better ways that we could monitor that people are actually doing that.”Lifting the lockdownOn lifting the coronavirus restrictions, Mr Varadkar said that the Government was working on a plan for the staged lifting of restrictions.“What we’re working on at the moment is a plan that will be ready by the end of April-early May in advance of the May 5th big day if you like. And what we hope to set out is a step-wise plan which indicates how we would reopen the country in different steps and what are the criteria that would have to be met to move from one stage to the next.”Mr Varadkar said until that plan was ready, he would prefer not to speculate on what would open first.“I really understand that a lot of people are beginning to find the lockdown, starting to find the restrictions very difficult, and I’d prefer not to raise hopes or raise expectations only to dash them,” he said.He said he hoped that in May the Government could authorise the reopening of “certain services, certain parts of the economy and then review it every two to three weeks.”“But I’d rather give people certainty when we have that towards the end of April or early May,” he said.ChildcareMr Varadkar said the government had a plan to provide childcare for healthcare workers, but would wait to have the plan assessed on public health grounds.“We have worked up a solution - the money is there to do it. But it does require public health clearance from the National Public Health Emergency Team so they’re going to discuss it again tomorrow and hopefully we’ll be able to provide that. But I know it’s been very delayed and I know that people are very frustrated about it.Mr Varadkar said it was “probably true” that the virus would come in waves, pointing to the example of Japan, where the second wave of the virus was now hitting, he said. He said that public health authorities did not know how many people had been exposed to the virus, and “we won’t know that until we have an accurate antibody test”. He said “it could be one per cent, it could be 25 per cent” of people who had been exposed to the virus and had immunity.Nursing homesMr Varadkar conceded that it would have been better to commence testing for the virus in nursing homes earlier but he said that “last week and the week before we had a massive backlog of tests - and they were tests of people who actually had symptoms, so even if we had done the tests, we wouldn’t have got the test results.“That’s just the reality of this situation - since day one, since the cabinet sub committee was set up in early March, we’ve had to do six or seven things all at the same time - making sure we’ve enough PPE, making sure we got testing up and running, making sure that we’d adequate hospital capacity, making sure that we had the lockdown and social distancing measures in place, making sure we looked after the economic and welfare effects of this crisis. “And also from day one, making sure that we looked out for congregated settings - nursing homes, prisons, homeless hubs, direct provision centres - anywhere where there’s a lot of people congregating. “So it’s never been a case of prioritising one over the other - we’ve been trying to do all six of these things all at the same time and we’ve run into problems with all of them actually at one point or another, and we’ll continue to do so. But I think overall we’re doing the best that we can in a very difficult situation.”Mr Varadkar said that “nobody can say” whether it would have made any difference if restrictions on nursing homes had been introduced earlier, and said that he would not second guess the recommendations of the chief medical officer who had told nursing homes there was no need to restrict visitors last month. He said that Fine Gael had stood aside after the election but that it was not possible to form a left-led government and said that those who sought such a government “seem to have given up trying at this stage”. Fine Gael had been willing to “step into the breach” he said and was now reaching out to smaller parties to see if a government could be formed. “But we do need a third party and we do need to make sure it’s a majority government and one that can last”. He said there had been “very little discussion” on who should fill what job and who should be Taoiseach first.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4233132.1587378150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus global cases pass 2 4m as world leaders consider lockdowns","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNovice monks wearing face shields as a preventive measure against the spread of the Covid-19 at Wat Molilokkayaram Buddhist temple in Bangkok on April 20th, 2020.

New Zealand will ease its lockdown next week, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Monday as the country’s transmission rate fell to 0.48.Meanwhile in the US people protested against the extension of stay-at-home orders while the death toll there rose to the highest in the world.The economic fallout was evident in Asian share markets on Monday as expectations a busy week of corporate earnings reports and economic data was set to drive home the damage done by the global virus lockdown.The following is a summary of global coronavirus updates.Americas The US death toll from the coronavirus rose to more than 40,000, the highest in the world and almost double the number of deaths in the next highest country Italy, according to a Reuters tally. Protests flared in US states on Sunday over stay-at-home orders while governors disputed president Donald Trump’s claims they have enough tests. The number of people with the Covid-19 in Canada is trending in the right direction but strict physical distancing will need to stay in place, prime minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday. Mexico has registered a total of 8,261 confirmed coronavirus cases and 686 deaths as of Sunday. Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro again attended a public rally and attacked lockdown measures. Chile reported on Sunday that there were more than 10,000 people in the country with the coronavirus, while Peru reported on Sunday that more than 15,000 cases had been recorded so far.Guatemala said a total of 50 migrants deported by the United States to the country have tested positive for coronavirus. EuropeRussian president Vladimir Putin said that Russian authorities had the coronavirus crisis under full control and that everything would work out with God’s help, even as the country on Sunday registered a record daily rise in cases of the new virus. Italy said on Sunday that deaths from the coronavirus pandemic rose by 433, the lowest daily tally in a week, and the number of new cases slowed to 3,047 from a previous 3,491.  The number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in Spain has surpassed the 200,000 threshold, the country’s health ministry said on Monday.The ministry said the number of cases rose to 200,210 from 195,944 cases on Sunday. Spain has the second highest number of diagnosed cases in the world after the United States. The cumulative death toll increased by 399 to 20,852 on Monday, the ministry said. The coronavirus situation in France is improving “slowly but surely” and shortages of protective gear such as face masks are easing, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Sunday. Britain is not considering lifting the lockdown imposed almost four weeks ago to control the coronavirus outbreak given “deeply worrying” increases in the death toll, a senior minister said. Poland saw its biggest spike in coronavirus cases on Sunday with 545 new infections recorded, according to health ministry data. Asia-PacificChina reported 12 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, down from 16 a day earlier, with no new deaths. More than 150 Australian economists on Monday warned the government against easing social distancing rules.New Zealand will extend lockdown measures by a week and move to a lower level of restriction from April 27th. South Korea extended its social distancing policy for another 15 days but offered some relief for churches and sporting fixtures. Thailand’s king approved laws to implement spending measures worth 1.9 trillion baht (€53.84 billion) to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on the economy. Pakistan has started repatriating some of its citizens from the United Arab Emirates, which had threatened to review labour ties with countries refusing to take back their nationals during the pandemic. Middle East and AfricaHealth ministers from the Group of 20 major economies began a virtual meeting on Sunday to work on a joint response to the coronavirus pandemic, Saudi Arabian state television reported. Saudi Arabia’s highest religious body, the Council of Senior Scholars, urged Muslims worldwide to pray at home during Ramadan if their countries require social distancing. Turkey’s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen to 86,306, the highest total for any country outside Europe or the United States. Iran has extended furloughs for prisoners for another month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, as the Islamic Republic endeavours to stem the spread of the new coronavirus in its crowded jails. Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Sunday extended a lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus by two weeks, but will allow mining companies to get back to work. Economic fallout Caution gripped Asian share markets on expectations a busy week of corporate earnings reports and economic data will drive home the damage done by the global virus lockdown, while a glut of supply sent US crude spiralling to 20-year lows. Neiman Marcus Group is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, becoming the first major US department store operator to succumb to the economic fallout from the outbreak. China cut its benchmark lending rate as expected on Monday to reduce borrowing costs for companies and prop up the coronavirus-hit economy. Japan’s exports slumped the most in nearly four years in March. The number of UK finance professionals seeking new jobs rose by more than 40 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the last three months of 2019. Canada will invest C$2.5 billion (€1.6 billion) in measures to help the hard-hit oil and gas industry during the coronavirus outbreak, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.

Up to 1,000 soldiers and civilians have so far been killed by the group. Then, in the past few weeks, everything changed.No longer masked, the militants seized important towns and villages in a series of sophisticated operations launched under the noses of a Kremlin-linked Russian mercenary outfit.Unfurling the black flag of Islamic State in southern Africa for the first time, the fighters defiantly declared their intention to turn a region that will soon be vital to Britain’s energy security into a Sharia-based caliphate.Until recently, Cabo Delgado’s insurgency had garnered little attention in Western capitals.For many politicians, it seemed to be just another obscure conflict taking place in a chronically corrupt country with a long history of violence.But the latest attacks and the threat they potentially pose to what is becoming one of the world’s most important gas regions are causing a rapid and urgent reassessment.Until recently, the violence in Cabo Delgado had indeed seemed like a local affair.True, the group responsible for it had initially been dominated by foreigners, radical east African Muslims who fled down the Swahili coast after their leader, Aboud Rogo, was killed by police in Kenya in 2012. But they were rapidly able to find adherents among the local population.Cabo Delgado should be one of the richest regions in Africa. Not only does it boast the world’s largest ruby mine, it is home to a £44bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) programme — the continent’s largest ever energy project — that is being developed by some of the world’s biggest oil companies.With investment in the LNG project set to double over the coming decade, Cabo Delgado is turning Mozambique into an energy superpower, one of the ten largest producers of natural gas in the world.As Britain’s North Sea reserves dwindle, the UK is among those queuing up for a share of the region’s resources. Last year Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, entered into a joint venture to buy 2.6m tonnes of LNG from Mozambique a year for the next two decades.The mostly Muslim population of Cabo Delgado has seen little of the wealth, however. The region is by far the least developed in Mozambique and its 2.3 million people the poorest, making some ripe for recruitment.As its ranks swelled, the group -- which operated under a series of names, most commonly Ansar al-Sunna -- grew steadily bolder after launching its first attacks in 2017, culminating in its apparent adoption into the ISIL franchise at some point in the past six months.Increasingly worried by the group\u0027s growing capability, Mozambique’s government last year deployed 200 Russian mercenaries to Cabo Delgado from the Wagner Group, believed to be owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin.Although the Russians arrived with attack helicopters, drones and sophisticated weaponry they were swiftly forced to make a “tactical retreat”. As many as 12 Russians have been killed, according to diplomats.Success against the Russians seems to have emboldened the militants further.From mid-March the number of attacks has surged.In the most significant, militants marched into the port of Mocimboa da Praia on 23rd March and seized control of the town.  Although they marched out 24 hours later — replicating a tactic used by al Shabaab in Somalia and Isil fighters in the Middle East — they had made their point. Mocimboa da Praia is just an hour’s drive from gas fields.Amid a collapse in oil prices and economic uncertainty unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic, the escalation in the insurgency is making western energy companies increasingly anxious.The reaction to the jihadist occupation of some towns, with many locals coming onto the streets to cheer, will do little to allay their nerves.It is difficult to tell how genuine the support is. Stepping up their public relations campaign, the Islamists have sought to woo people by distributing stolen food and blowing up cash machines to dole out banknotes.But support may also be rooted in fear. “We don’t want to hurt you,” a militant leader told residents in one captured town, according to video footage. “If you do not report us to the police, we will live with you.”“But if you denounce us and tell the pigs where we are hiding, the next time we come here we will kill everything, even chickens and eggs, old people and babies.”The threats, Western officials say, are working because neither locals nor the energy companies have any confidence in the ability of the underpaid and demoralised security forces to stand up to the jihadists.Instead of fighting when towns were attacked, many soldiers and police officers have been ditching their uniforms and blending into the civilian population, locals say.Few therefore believe Mozambique’s national police commander, Bernardino Rafael, who claims that the situation in Cabo Delgado is under control and the insurgents are merely a handful of “criminals” who will soon be dealt with.“When armed men come, instead of defending the population, the police flee,” said Viana Magalhaes, a senior opposition politician.  “If a group of insurgents can take control of a whole province, then the country has no protection.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brussels red faced hungary gets eu coronavirus cash italy","story":"The European Commission is under fire after its coronavirus emergency relief fund gave Hungary more than double the amount of EU money than Italy, which is the worst hit country in Europe. Italy received €2.3bn (£2 bn) from the €37bn Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative but Hungary, which has a sixth of the population of Italy, got €5.6bn (just under £4.9bn).  An estimated 172 people have died from the virus in Hungary compared to a staggering 23,660 victims in Italy. Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, was accused of exploiting the pandemic to give himself sweeping new powers to rule by decree on March 30. He will now benefit from the EU windfall, which was adopted on the same day, despite Brussels’ long-standing concerns over respect for the rule of law and democracy in Hungary. The commission admitted the mismatch was not “an optimal allocation”.  The emergency fund recycles unspent funds from the EU’s cohesion programmes, which is EU Budget money to raise living standards in the bloc’s poorer regions. Rather than disburse the cash according to need, the EU executive distributed it according to cohesion rules, which favoured Hungary, which is poorer than Italy. “Italy was allocated Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative funding equivalent to 0.1 percent of its GDP, and Spain 0.3 percent, Hungary received an astonishing 3.9 percent of its GDP,” the European Stability Initiative think tank said in a report. March 30, the date of Mr Orban’s Protection Against the Coronavirus Act and when the emergency fund was agreed, was “a dark day for EU assistance”, the think tank said. “Europeans now need to find better ways to defend the values enshrined in their treaties, not with pious words and empty threats, but in the language of power and money that politicians like Orban will understand,” the European Stability Initiative said. “What the EU needs today is a strategy that simultaneously addresses both threats to economic cohesion and to democracy, in a way that strengthens both.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up australians use exercise","story":"The profound weirdness of lockdown life hits all of us in different ways at different moments.In this country it’s the idle thought that perhaps we’ll have a Sunday lunch in the pub this weekend, before remembering that’s out of the question.In Spain it must be a similar situation when realising you can’t go out for an early evening drink and tapas at the normal time - 11.30pm.

We have stopped a wave of devastation.The country will be put on a level 3 alert from April 27 for at least two weeks, then the government will assess whether to further relax the lockdown.Ms Ardern said the level 4 lockdown had been extended five days beyond the original schedule to “lock in some gains” and give greater certainty that efforts to eliminate the virus were on track. The announcement means businesses deemed safe can reopen, along with some schools, while limits on local travel are also relaxed and gatherings of up to 10 people allowed for events such as weddings or funerals.New Zealand had some of the world\u0027s strictest rules, with hunting, surfing and swimming among banned activities. Ashley Bloomfield, the director of health, recommended the move.  Last week teachers expressed concerns at the prospect of returning to class, saying the level 3 rules were not strong enough to protect them or students.Bruce Cunningham, principal of Belmont Primary School in Auckland said he had “fielded over a dozen emails, texts or phone calls from my staff, and none of them were positive” about the shift to level 3. “I am disappointed that teachers, support staff and principals are being used as what seems to me as caregiversbabysitters for students whose parents move back to the workforce,” he wrote in an open letter to the education minister. He added that using schools to assist contact tracing suggested “it is OK to use teachers and children as sacrificial lambs.”Moving from level 4 to 3 should bring a multi-billion-dollar lift for business as all industries deemed capable of operating safely will be permitted to do so. In building and infrastructure, for example, around 300,000 workers with a NZ$46 billion annual output will be able to return to work. Brett O’Riley, the head of the Employers and Manufacturers Association,  said the move strikes “a good balance between our country\u0027s health and the economy” but “people must be vigilant and stick strictly to health and safety guidelines”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parisians clash heavy handed policing lockdown","story":"Police struggling to enforce lockdown restrictions in France have repeatedly come under attack in run-down suburbs, with clashes reported in a dozen cities across the country in the past week.In the latest violence, several hours of clashes erupted in the northern Paris suburb of Villeneuve-la-Garenne in the early hours of Monday after a 28-year-old motorcyclist suffered a leg injury in a collision with an unmarked police car.About 50 youths threw stones and aimed fireworks at police, who retaliated with tear gas. Dustbins were set on fire, filling the air with smoke.An angry crowd gathered after false rumours spread on social media that the motorcyclist was in a critical condition. It was also claimed that police had shot a man in another suburb, La Courneuve. Officers said the man was injured in a knife attack apparently motivated by gang rivalries.Clashes between disaffected youths and police have also broken out in Le Havre, Bordeaux, and a number of Parisian suburbs over the past week.It is difficult or impossible for officers to enforce lockdown in crime-prone areas where they and emergency workers are often attacked even when circumstances are normal, a police source told The .  Arrests or police checks often spark clashes in troubled, low-income neighbourhoods, where youth unemployment can be as high as 40 per cent.The conservative newspaper Le Figaro commented that the majority of residents are law-abiding, but a minority of delinquents and members of drug gangs routinely cause trouble when police appear in order to demonstrate that this is their territory and they control it.Police, firefighters and ambulance crews have been ambushed after being lured into traps on the pretext of false emergencies.The police source said: Lockdown has slowed down the drugs trade, like any other business, and that\u0027s causing tempers to rise, which makes enforcing restrictions on people’s movements extremely complicated.We\u0027re told to be discerning and avoid any situation that could lead to rioting, but there\u0027s a lot of hostility to police in some areas.

The primary international benchmark, Brent crude, was more stable than America\u0027s West Texas Intermediate, but still down 5.5 per cent to $26.70.Some of the price decline has been passed on to drivers with petrol prices in the UK dipping 11p a litre over the past month, but the AA said retailers had been slow to deliver the benefits.Analysts from Goldman Sachs warned earlier this month that the coronavirus crisis was “extremely negative for oil prices and is sending landlocked crude prices into negative territory.”That will hurt the oil industries in North America and Russia most, due to the geology and location of supplies there, the Wall Street bank said. America\u0027s fracking industry is widely forecast to suffer scores of bankruptcies this year as producers lose money when the oil price is low.Could coronavirus hasten the oil industry’s demise?Jeff Currie, Goldman\u0027s global head of commodities research, said the pandemic would “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics, restrict demand as economic activity normalises and shift the debate around climate change”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPart of the decline in prices on Monday was due to a technicality of the oil market. Most oil is traded via contracts based on its expected price on a future delivery date. May futures contracts are due to expire on Tuesday meaning traders are keen to offload them to avoid having to take physical delivery of oil and find a place to store it.Stuart Joyner, an energy specialist at Redburn, said: “The remarkable collapse in US crude prices is partly technical as we see funds position for the imminent contract expiry or ‘roll\u0027.However, he predicted prices over the summer reflect the fact that traders see storage capacity reaching its limits and are concerned about a longer-term reduction in oil demand.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The primary international benchmark, Brent crude, was more stable than America\u0027s West Texas Intermediate, but still down 5.5 per cent to $26.70.Some of the price decline has been passed on to drivers with petrol prices in the UK dipping 11p a litre over the past month, but the AA said retailers had been slow to deliver the benefits.Analysts from Goldman Sachs warned earlier this month that the coronavirus crisis was “extremely negative for oil prices and is sending landlocked crude prices into negative territory.”That will hurt the oil industries in North America and Russia most, due to the geology and location of supplies there, the Wall Street bank said. America\u0027s fracking industry is widely forecast to suffer scores of bankruptcies this year as producers lose money when the oil price is low.Could coronavirus hasten the oil industry’s demise?Jeff Currie, Goldman\u0027s global head of commodities research, said the pandemic would “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics, restrict demand as economic activity normalises and shift the debate around climate change”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPart of the decline in prices on Monday was due to a technicality of the oil market. Most oil is traded via contracts based on its expected price on a future delivery date. May futures contracts are due to expire on Tuesday meaning traders are keen to offload them to avoid having to take physical delivery of oil and find a place to store it.Stuart Joyner, an energy specialist at Redburn, said: “The remarkable collapse in US crude prices is partly technical as we see funds position for the imminent contract expiry or ‘roll\u0027.However, he predicted prices over the summer reflect the fact that traders see storage capacity reaching its limits and are concerned about a longer-term reduction in oil demand.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Zuckerberg stressed that only those health researchers see the information from Facebook\u0027s respondents, and that it cannot access the results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers are getting around a million responses a week, he said, and the results are already tallying with other publically available data on cases. Facebook hopes the responses will therefore be reliable enough to predict the spread of the disease as well as give precise insights into how the disease is spreading by county.The results indicate, for example, that in some New York City suburbs, an estimated 2 to 3 percent of people are experiencing covid-19-like symptoms, he wrote in an article published in the Washington Post.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastMr Zuckerberg said Facebook can uniquely help researchers and promoted the role of social networks in generating such data. By distributing surveys to large numbers of people whose identities we know, we can quickly generate enough signal to correct for biases and ensure sampling is done properly, he said.As well as rolling out the survey globally, Facebook will build a tool that lets researchers everywhere access the results from the survey, he said. We’re hopeful that this will help governments and public health officials around the world who might not otherwise have this kind of precise data to make decisions in the weeks and months ahead, he wrote.Mr Zuckerberg said the company was also collaborating with universities, healthcare organisations and governments across the world to provide other help, such as artificial inteligence tools to try and predict needs for resources such as personal protective equipment.Despite Facebook\u0027s attempts to help with the coronavirus outbreak, it has been criticised for serving as a platform for a wide variety of misinformation and other problematic posts. The company has rolled out a series of responses to the virus, which have ranged from anti-misinformation campaigns to new product features that improve group video\u0026nbspchats.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable,” Mr Jermey writes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe blunt acknowledgement by Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcomes amid increasing anger at home and abroad over\u0026nbspfailures by national governments to prepare\u0026nbspadequately for\u0026nbspthe infectious disease, which has so far claimed more than 150,000\u0026nbsplives globally.\u0026nbsp​“Humanity’s relentless exploitation of wildlife has been putting us at increasing risk of an event like this for decades. And this knowledge has not been some big secret, despite the rhetoric from various world leaders claiming this pandemic couldn’t have been anticipated,” Mr Jermey writes.\u0026nbsp”The truth is, we knew this was coming.”The message would\u0026nbspappear relevant for successive Conservative governments, which\u0026nbsphave been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings\u0026nbspwithin “pandemic preparedness” documents over the past decade.To minimise the risk of future pandemics, Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcalls for the international community to focus on better regulation of so-called “wet markets”, such as the one in Wuhan largely considered the epicentre of the outbreak, and a renewed battle against the “illegal and unsustainable” wildlife trade.\u0026nbspOf the latter, Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent and Evening Standard, wrote last week: “From the financing of terrorists like Al-Shabab to the propagation of corruption and smuggling groups, this demand has done untold damage to the African continent.

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Our new investigation has transformed archaeological knowledge of Roman Nazareth,” said Dr Dark, who has just published the results of his research in a new book Roman-Period and Byzantine Nazareth and its Hinterland.“For the first time ever, we are now gaining a reasonable understanding of the sort of place Nazareth was in Roman times.”By examining in detail all the archaeological evidence, gained from recent landscape-survey work and from a detailed re-analysis of previous excavations, we are now beginning to learn about the cultural and economic environment in which Jesus grew up,“ Dr Dark told The Independent.One of the most significant revelations to have come out of Dr Dark’s investigation is the fact that the farmers of Nazareth seem to have had a prohibition on the use of human manure as a fertiliser, in contrast to the people of Sepphoris and potentially many other areas. Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered. The charities like The Felix Project and Made in Hackney are doing really important work, and it seems like they enjoy doing it too.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits. She wrote the foreword for Together, a collection of the women’s own personal recipes from across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mark Curtin, Felix’s chief executive, said: “The women of Hubb Community Kitchen have stepped up yet again in the face of a global pandemic.“We stand together with all of our partners to get food to people most at risk of experiencing hunger and malnutrition in this time of need.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in\u0026nbspThe Independent, said: “It is a pleasure to have the backing of the Duchess of Sussex for our campaign.\u0026nbspHer support for the survivors of the Grenfell fire is truly admirable. Our campaign will continue to support the Hubb Community Kitchen, along with so many other essential community organisations at this time.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd of those who supported an extension, 64 per cent wanted the transition period to be extended “indefinitely until the crisis is resolved”, while 36 per cent wanted the transition period to be extended “for a maximum of a year”.But\u0026nbsp34 per cent of all respondents said they believed\u0026nbspministers could “balance dealing with the coronavirus outbreak whilst also giving necessary time to negotiate a full trade deal with the EU before the end of the year”.\u0026nbspWhile there was strong support among Labour and SNP voters for pushing the end of the transition period past New Year’s Eve, some 49 per cent of Leave voters also supported the measure – as well as 48 per cent of Conservative voters and 45 per cent of those who previously backed the Brexit Party.Best for Britain chief executive Naomi Smith said: “There is clear support in Scotland and other nations and regions of the UK for an extension, and the views of small ‘c’ conservative voters in our data is telling.

They’re also using mobile apps tied to payments, such as Amazon Prime Now, to place delivery or pickup orders for groceries. The Treasury Department may even let people who don’t have bank accounts receive their coronavirus relief checks via mobile-payment services like Venmo.“We shouldn’t be touching anything,” said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of mobile-payment research firm Crone Consulting. He expects contactless payments to grab an additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent of transactions at stores and ATMs as the result of the pandemic. Person-to-person services like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle should benefit as well, Mr Crone said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s easy to see why. Even with retail stores cleaning more often than ever – if they’re open at all – handling cash or touching payment keypads stands out as a major risk. With contactless pay, you link a bank account or credit card to your phone and then tap the device on a contactless reader or hover over it to trigger payment.Already, 27 per cent of US small businesses have seen an increase in customers using services like Apple Pay, according to a survey of 361 companies released in April by the Strawhecker Group and the Electronic Transactions Association. Publix Super Markets sped up its transition to contactless terminals because of Covid-19, according to the company. Starting in early April, consumers at all Publix stores have been able to use services like Apple Pay and Google Pay to check out.“I know a lot of merchants are putting signage up at the point of sale, ‘Please use contactless’,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, a Mastercard executive who works with banks and credit unions.Burger King released a commercial in March to encourage customers to use an order-ahead app to pay at drive-thrus.A couple of weeks ago, retail giant Walmart Inc. tweaked its self-checkout system to go completely contactless when shoppers use Walmart Pay. Previously, you had to touch a “Pay now” button after scanning your groceries. Now, you can read a QR code with your phone to pay. Use of pickup and delivery at Walmart is growing as well.A million doses of coronavirus vaccine could be available by September“You are seeing customers start to use services they weren’t interested in before,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman.Many sellers at farmers’ markets have stopped accepting cash, and are instead using apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. The app got it started as a way for friends to reimburse each other for dinner or for roommates to handle rent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some are buying items in bulk for the whole neighbourhood and then using Zelle to collect payments. Others are sending cash gifts to relatives for their birthdays.“People don’t want to handle cash, especially at this time, so they are looking to mobile payments as the b,est alternatives,” Ms Fintland said.That said, the coronavirus shutdown has hurt some types of mobile payment services and forced others to adjust.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastToast Inc., which makes management systems for restaurants, laid off half its staff in April. Earlier this week, Grubhub pulled its 2020 guidance, largely because of the acute situation in New York, where many restaurants have closed. Companies that serve ride-sharing companies, like Stripe and Adyen, may also suffer as usage declines.The industry’s established players are also facing new competition. In March, portable-reader heavyweight Square Inc. rolled out ways for its restaurant owners to offer pickup and delivery options.“We’ve seen so many folks pivoting to online to keep their businesses going,” said Katie Dally, a Square spokeswoman. Independent booksellers and other businesses are offering pickup and delivery too, she said.As more people embrace contactless technology and get used to paying that way, consumer behaviour is going to change for good, experts say.The rush delivery service at supermarket chain Safeway hit 670,000 weekly active US mobile users the week of 29 March, up from fewer than 50,000 in the week of 1 March, according to the analytics platform App Annie. Amazon Prime Now’s Android and iPhone active user base grew 60 per cent, according to App Annie.“It’s behaviour that’s going to stick after stay at home ends,” said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. “There will be muscle memory about paying, and consumers will use it going around their daily life.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are the details on the current situation.Coronavirus has closed schools and cancelled exams across the country except for pupils of key workers and vulnerable children.In his March  address, Boris Johnson stated UK schools will be closed “until further notice”, leaving a lot of ambiguity as the truth is that we dont know how long lockdown measures will last.Michael Gove has said that schools wont re-open May , though there are plans in the works.The government is still asking parents to keep their children at home, wherever possible, and has asked schools to remain open only for those children who absolutely need to attend.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson unveiled Oak National Academy, which is set to provide  lessons a week for those still at home.BBC have also revealed their Bitesize Daily lessons in which celebrities and teachers will provide daily videos to help parents with homeschooling their children and give kids fun things to do while learning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Schools are closed because the scientic and medical advice indicated that was the safest thing to do, and schools will subsequently re-open when advice shows it is safe to do so.There is current speculation that they wont fully open until September , though this really depends on the state of how Britain handles the spread of the virus.There are plans in the making to have a staggered approach and mitigate risk of spreading the virus at the same time as working in social distancing measures.Several ministers had suggested opening after Easter, but this was shut down as the coronavirus lockdown is expected to last until at least next month.Only the children with parents that are key workers are currently going into skeleton schools to ensure they have someone to look after them during the normal school hours.Schools for younger children are expected tosooner than those in high school due to them needing their parents to remain at home to look after them.The government is concerned that the continued lockdown will have huge economic implications, therefore they are eager for workers toto work - which they would not be able to dothey have children of school age that require adults to look after them.Last week, primary school children were linked with potentially ing as soon as May , but education chiefs have since said that they are looking into gradually opening schools again in June.For secondary school students, there is no current timetable as to when they will- but may not be back until September.Teachers are conducting distance learning with pupils and a lot of online tutoring companies have been offering free assistance.Yet, with exams cancelled, including GCSEs, they may not be back until the next school year.Exams have been cancelled, leaving hard-working teenagers in a dficult, stressful and frustrating place around their futures.The exam regulator, Ofqual, and exam boards will work with teachers to provide grades to students whose exams have been cancelled this summer. Exam boards will not be issuing any papers or tests at all.The government is using a mix of student performance criteria that include teacher assessments, mock exam grades and overviews of a pupils general work.The government guidelines say: The calculated grades awarded will be formal grades, with the same status as grades awarded in any other year.University representatives expect universities to be flexible and do all they can to support students and ensure they can progress to higher education.There is a lot of worry over how that will play out in practice, particularly for underprivileged students or kids who just didnt take the mock exams as seriously as the real deal.If a student does not believe the correct process has been followed in their case they will be able to appeal on that basis.In addition,they do not feel their calculated grade reflects their performance, they will have the opportunity to sit an exam, as soon as is reasonably possible after schools and colleges open again.Students will also have the option to sit their exams in summer .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If it is going to arrive today is will probably arrive late in the day, he told BBC Radio s Today programme.He added: It would have been better had the Government not made the announcement in the first place and said staff would need to make their own assessment over whether they felt safe with the PPE currently on offer.The delay comes as medics were told to treat coronavirus patients in flimsy plastic aprons rather than gowns.Hospitals are on the brink of running out of the , gowns they need each day, the NHS confederation, which represents managers, has warned.The British Medical Associations Dr Chaand Nagpaul described the delay as very concerning.“There are limits to the level of risk staff can be expected to expose themselves and their patients to, he said.“In the most extreme circumstances,adequate protective measures are not in place, doctors can refuse to put themselves at risk of becoming infected, and inform their management to make alternative arrangements.Professor Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons, has told colleagues not to risk their healthgood PPE could not be used when treating coronavirus patients.We are deeply disturbed by this latest change to personal protective equipment guidance, which was issued without consulting medical bodies, he said.After weeks of working with PHE and our sister medical royal colleges to get PPE guidance right, this risks confusion and iation in practice across the country.Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer has backed a call for the UK to observe a minutes silence to remember health and care workers who have died with Covid-.The Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives, and Unison, want the tribute to be held at am on April , International Workers’ Memorial Day.The Department of Health has named  NHS victims of Covid-, but the Nursing Notes website, which is run by nurses, put the figure at  yesterday.Public Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow reuse of gowns that is normally single-use only or even wear white lab coats and wash them afterwards.A source with knowledge of the plan said: The new guidance will say this is what you doyou dont have any gowns. Wear an apron instead – that will be the new policy for the foreseeable future, though the medical organisations will go mad about that.At least  NHS and healthcare workers have so far died from coronavirus, with many families blaming a lack of PPE.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told yesterdays briefing: They should be assured we are doing everything we can correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.When pressed on the issue, Mr Jenrick added: Supply in some areas, particularly gowns and certain types of masks and aprons, is in short supply at the moment, and that must be an extremely anxious time for people working on the front line, but they should be assured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.He added: My assessment is that most trusts will be out of stock after the weekend on current consumption.A sustainable level of gowns will not be reached until mid-June, told the Independent reported.Panicked ministers have drafted in the boss of the  London Olympics to be a PPE czar.Lord Paul Deighton will take charge of scaling up production and co-ordinating distribution.Top-end firms including Burberry, Barbour, Louis Vuitton and Philip Treacy have all said their manufacturing equipment could be used in the effort.Shadow health minister Justin Madders said the number of key workers still without protective equipment was a scandal.Workers have been sounding the alarm for weeks now and the Government has had months to put things in place, he said.It is outrageous that supplies keep running so low, protecting those staff who are risking their lives every time they go to work should be an absolute priority.Ministers need to make good on their promises, sort out the supply issues and work to make sure no staff member feels unsafe because of a lack of PPE. It is no good making grand promisesthey later turn out to be undeliverable.On Friday Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned the UK was tight on gowns.He added: I would love to be able to wave a magic wand and have PPE fall from the sky in large quantities and be able to answer your question about when shortages will be resolved.But given that we have a global situation in which there is less PPE in the world than the world needs, obviously it’s going to be a huge pressure point.The Royal College of Nursing said half of nursing staff, including those in the most high-risk environments, have felt pressured into working without proper PPE.They are reusing kit, are short of alcohol rub and wearing eye protection they have bought or made at home.Dame Donna Kinnair, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: These figures unmask the gut-wrenching shortages nursing staff are dealing with in all health care settings.It is little wonder they are in such fear for their own safety and that of their patients.This crisis is taking the lives of nursing staff, and their colleagues feel they’ve been left exposed.All decision makers involved here need to get an urgent grip on the situation.Nursing staff just want to do their jobs – they must be given protection in order to do so. In response, The Department of Health said: We are working round the clock given the global shortage of gowns and other PPE to secure the NHS and the social care sector the equipment they need.New clinical advice has been issued today to make sure thatthere are shortages in one area, frontline staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk.This has been reviewed by the Health and Safety Executive, and is in line with WHO and CDC guidance on PPE use in exceptional circumstances.There is a  hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report shortages in supply and it is crucial the relevant guidance for protective equipment is followed closely. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" There are three main options that can be considered as alternativesgowns are not available:·        Reserve disposable, fluid repellent gown  coveralls for AGPs and surgical procedures·        Disposable, non-fluid repellent gowns  coveralls with a disposable plastic apron for high-risk settings and AGPs with forearm washing once gown  coverall is removed·        Reusablesurgical gowns  coveralls or similar suitable clothingwith a disposable plastic apron for AGPs and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown  coverall is removed.

Last night it remained unclear when it will arrive.At least  health workers have died from coronavirus with -year-old paramedic Stuart Monk, who died on Friday, among the latest.Better quality protective gear is in such short supply that ambulance crews have been told to use it onlya patient is showing symptoms of coronavirus or is in cardiac arrest.But often the heart stops beating mid-treatment, meaning paramedics must decide between risking the patient’s le by getting changed or being at risk of coronavirus by staying in their flimsy bibs and masks.The full- gowns and visors are kept in the ambulance, so valuable time can be wasted putting them on.One North West Ambulance Service worker said: “If I was working in a sandwich shop I would get better protection.

One WMAS paramedic said: “I have an agreement with my colleague where one will do chest compressions in the plastic bib while the other changes.“Then theyand take over while the other gets changed. We are having to adapt to protect ourselves and patients because the guidelines don’t make sense in real le.”They cannot wear their own PPE, evenit is superior, because bosses say they will not be insured.Staff also claim ambulance services are not able to test how well masks fit because it is too time- consuming and too costly.Instead, they are left with flimsy surgical masks with wide gaps, offering minimal protection.The higher-quality PPE consists of a long-sleeved, fluid-repellent gown covering the arms and body, a filtering face-piece respirator and a full-face shield with visor.But the NWAS source said: “We should be wearing the high-risk gear everywhere, because we are always at risk.One nurse has gone home and given it to her husband, who is now critical himself. Until this week we’d been given no PPE whatsoever.”She added: “The rest of the wards are left to struggle.” A hospital spokesperson insisted it had enough PPE.“Because it sits in the ambulance sometimes we only find out it doesn’t fit when someone goes into cardiac arrest. I’m quite a big-chested woman and the other day when someone went into cardiac arrest it tore as I tried to get it on — it’s not a professional look and puts both me and the patient at risk.“The masks and visors have run out.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown.

Why not where The thousands of coronavirus mutual aid groups could make enough homemade masks for everyone, so it would cost next to nothing.Instructions are easily available, for example, at masksall.org.uk.A petition has also been started by MasksAll urging the Government to make masks mandatory in the UK.The medics are advising people make reusable cotton masks from simple items you can find in your house, such as scarves or towels.They say that doing this would not detract from surgical masks for the NHS and other key workers.The group say they have been inspired by action taken in other countries that have introduced face masks at population level, such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria.In particular, they point out that the German city of Jena saw new cases of coronavirus flatline since it brought in compulsory masks on April .Jon Fluxman, a retired GP, who is backing the campaign told Theit was “striking how countries who adopted masks-for-all are doing so much better than we are”.Dr Fluxman cited the Covid- lead doctor in South Korea, which on Saturday had less than ten new cases, “who is very clear that masks-for-all works”.Martin Yuille, Professor of Virology at Manchester University and backer of MasksAll, added that a mask offered “the possibility of an exit strategy”.Currently, the World Health Organisationsays only people who are showing symptoms or caring for coronavirus patients should wear them.However, WHOs main adviser David Heymann recently said he believeswearing a mask is equally effective or more effective than distancing.A review is set to be carried out tomorrow as to whether Brits should be ordered to wear a face mask in public.Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty recently confirmed that discussions about public use of face masks were a very live issue.He added: What we are really trying to do is to work out under what circumstances,any, should we extend the advice.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair today warned that people will only get back to workmade to wear masks.Mr Blair said it would need a massive effort to mass produce masks for people before they can head back to offices.He said: “I can’t believe people will be going back to work without wearing masks. You are going to need mass production of that.”The former Labour PM added that the coronavirus outbreak is “the most dficult and complicated challenge I have ever seen in politics.”London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also called for Londoners to wear face masks outside - including on public transport.Mr Khan told BBC Radio : The point Im making to Government experts and to Government is I think advice should change.Advice should change so in those circumstances where its not possible to keep social distancing - think of public transport, think of when you re in a shop - we should use non medical facial covering like bandanas, like scarves, like reusable masks.Mr Khan stressed wearing masks should not replace social distancing, but should be used where people are still having to leave home to go to work.He added medical grade personal protective equipment should be reserved for health professionals, becauseused wrongly it can be counter-productive.Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that members of the public wearing masks risked increasing shortages for NHS staff on the front line.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealProfessor Whitty said he remained concerned that advising the public to wear masks could lead to shortages.NHS heroes fighting on the frontline against coronavirus say theyve been forced to buy their own protective equipment from DIY stores.And data from the NHSppe app, created to track shortages of PPE, found that  per cent of doctors lacked the correct gowns for high risk procedures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

coverage and can of course take action to answer any criticism they consider unfair or inaccurate through several channels.But the answer should never be to attempt to shun inidual titles and their millions of readers. reported the new treatment would apply to the four newspapers, their Sunday editions and their online mastheads.The Daily Star has not been named, though it is published by the group that owns the Mirror and the Express.Under the revised media policy, Harry and Meghans press team will not even answer calls from the papers.In the letter, the couple said: This policy is not about avoiding criticism. Its not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad.Executive Director Ian Murray said: Although the Duke and Duchess say they support a free press and all it stands for there is no escaping their actions here amount to censorship and they are setting an unfortunate example.Although the couple may no longer style themselves as working royals, they continue to be high-profile public figures and indeed have made plain their intention to continue to do so.By appearing to dictate which media they will work with and which they will ignore they, no doubt unintentionally, give succour to the rich and powerful everywhere to use their example as an excuse to attack the media when it suits them.The truth is that Harry and Meghan have enjoyed and continue to enjoy a huge amount of positive coverage for themselves and their causes, much of it carried in the very titles they are now targeting.They may have been stung by some of the coverage they have not liked, they may disagree strongly with some elements of that coverage and can of course take action to answer any criticism they consider unfair or inaccurate through several channels.But the answer should never be to attempt to shun inidual titles and their millions of readers.But it cant be based on a lie.They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media.The letter also added the couple had watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.The couple have stepped back from their royal duties and are living in Calornia.In the wake of the decision, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan hit out at the couple.Speaking today, he said: They prepared a y statement - the fact they managed to take the time to do that in this crisis makes me want to vomit.He added: I might remind him the world is in a war at the moment with a killer virus that is destroying lives.Prince Harry this weekend was slammed for claiming things are better than we’re led to believe when it came to the coronavirus crisis.And Prince Charless biographer Tom Bower said: The Sussexes have become their own worst enemies. They clearly cannot stand being irrelevant and ignored.In the midst of a horrendous global crisis causing so much misery all they can think about is themselves.Prior to stepping down from the royal family, Meghan and Harry launched an attack on the UKs newspapers in a dedicated media section on their new website Sussexroyal.The couple, who said they will be adopting a revised media approach from the spring, criticised Britains royal correspondents and said they would no longer participate in the royal rota system which has been used by Buckingham Palace for decades.Meghan is involved in legal action against Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline, over an article which reproduced parts of the handwritten letter sent to Thomas Markle, , in August .Harry described the media as a powerful force in an emotional speech just a day after saying he and his we would be stepping back from royal duties.The duke has had a complicated and dficult relationship with the press through the years. His dislike of the media has seemingly intensied since the birth of his son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor last year.Harry was  when his mum, Princess Diana was killed in a crash after her car, driven at speed, was chased through the streets of Paris by the paparazzi.Soon after he began dating Meghan, Harry attacked the media over its abuse and harassment of his then girlfriend, with Kensington Palace warning on his behalf: This is not a game - it is her le.As The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specically as it pertains to your organisation.Like you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracy - particularly in moments of crisis.At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for whats right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account.It has been said that journalisms first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly.It is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or print - even when they know it to be distorted, , or invasive beyond reason.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded. There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.With that said, please note that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet.There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see. This policy is not about avoiding criticism.Its not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad.But it cant be based on a lie. They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging.And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more erse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever.What they wont do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion. We are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Contact tracing involves tracking down as many people as possible who have come into contact with a person confirmed to have caught Covid-. Mr Hunt said contact tracing should be the UK’s next “national mission.” In an online video, he said: “The countries that have had the biggest success in keeping coronavirus deaths low are places like Korea and Germany that haven’t just done a lot of testing, they’ve used the data from testing to track down people who’ve had the virus, people they’ve been in contact with and isolate and quarantine them as well. “Andwe are going to use the extra capacity that we now have in testing, which is so welcome, this is the way to do it.”  He said such a programme could be undertaken nationally through Public Health England or locally through local councils. And he said consideration should be given to “feet on the ground” methods of tracing as well as technology like smartphone apps. Mr Hunt also suggested the government could lt the lockdown in areas with “low transmission” in order to test the contact tracing system without undermining the national lockdown messages. Urging the government to appoint a single person to head up the project, Mr Hunt said: “There are lots of people who can do this, but I hope we will get a move on so that the cabinet has a choice to the current national lockdown when they come to review this decision in just under  weeks time.” The World Health Organisation’s advice on lting lockdown measures recommends that a country must have the capacity to detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at the Commons health committee on Friday that the government is working “incredibly hard” to develop a way to do this. We do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible, he said. And we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people and weaposre building that resource and obviously we need to have the testing and weaposre ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and weaposre working incredibly hard to make sure that we are. The government plans to release a smartphone app which uses bluetooth to keep an anonymous log of every person an inidual has been in close contact with and alert themone should test positive for Covid-.

The move is part of a push to make remote education accessible for children while schools are closed, and includes a new online academy to offer pupils online lessons. It comes on what would have been the first day of summer term for most pupils, and after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said no date has been set for re-opening schools in England. He apologised to pupils for the interruption to their studies and said there are no plans to open schools in England over the summer holidays. Mr Williamson told the daily Downing Street press conference on Sunday that five tests must be met before English schools can re-open, People are anxious to know when weaposre going to relax restrictions, when schools are likely to be fully back and open again, he said. Of course, I want nothing more than to see schools back, get them back to normal, make sure the children are sat around, learning, and experiencing the joy of being at school. But I canapost give you a date. Because before we do, we need to meet five tests. Here’s how the new scheme will work, who is eligible and how to apply. Who is eligible for a free laptop or internet connection   The government is making free laptops and G routers available to people based on a set of criteria. They must not already have access to one, and must be in one of the following groups:Children with a social worker Care leavers Disadvantaged children in year , ahead of GCSEs next yearElectronic devices will be ordered for pupils in the most vital stages of their education for those who receive support from a social worker and care leavers, the Department for Education said. And schools and colleges will be able to keep the laptops and tablets once they have reopened. The devices will be distributed by local authorities through education providers - mainly schools and academy trusts. They’re expected to make the decision on who needs a device -you’re not sure whether you qualy, get in touch with your school. How long will it take  Local authorities are being instructed to distribute the devices as quickly as possible starting now - but timescales may be dferent in dferent locations.It’s worth bearing in mind that as with everything at the minute, the coronavirus lockdown can slow things down.What about older children  Separately to the free devices scheme,  to -year-olds in education without a suitable device or connectivity and whose family can’t afford these costs can apply for support through the - Bursary Fund. Decisions on this are taken by education providers - contact your school or college for details.

Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the top official at the Home Office, has launched a constructive dismissal case against his former department according to his union. Since reports emerged in February Priti Patel has denied all allegations that she behaved inappropriately to either Sir Philip or other Home Office staff. Dave Penman, General Secretary of the First Division Association told the : “This morning Sir Philip, with the support of his legal team and the FDA, submitted a claim to the employment tribunal for constructive dismissal and whistleblowing against the home secretary. Sir Philip will not be making any further comment at this time.” In a separate statement he added: On  February , Sir Philip Rutnam resigned as Permanent Secretary of the Home Office, indicating that he intended to pursue a claim of constructive dismissal.Following his resignation, the FDA instructed Gavin Mansfield QC, Head of Littleton Chambers and employment law specialist, as Counsel to advise Sir Philip, supported by Clive Howard, Senior Principal Lawyer, Employment and Partnership at Slater and Gordon. “This morning, Sir Philip, with the support of his legal team and the FDA, submitted a claim to the employment tribunal for unfairdismissal and whistleblowing against the Home Secretary. It is understood that Sir Philipaposs claim will be that he was constructively dismissed from his role as Home Office permanent secretary after informing the Cabinet Office that Patel had belittled officials in meetings and made unreasonable demands on staff. There is no upper limit on the damages whistle blowers can be paidthey are successful in a case for constructive dismissal. Before leaving the department reports circulated of disagreements between Ms Ptel and Sir Philip, it included claims she mistreated officials - which she has denied. Boris Johnson has repeatedly tressed he has full confidence in Ms Patel, but after mounting pressure No  was forced to launch a probe into the Home Secretaries behaviour which is yet to report.When he resigned Sir Philip said: I have this morning resigned as permanent secretary of the Home Office. I take this decision with great regret after a career of  years. I am making this statement now because I will be issuing a claim against the Home Office for constructive dismissal. In the last  days, I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign. It has been alleged that I have briefed the media against the home secretary.

The lost , gowns in particular will be felt as hospitals run out of them and emergency plans to reuse existing clothing trigger fears among frontline staff who are without the proper armour to fight Covid-. Cabinet Ministers including Michael Gove and Gavin Williamson add insult to injury by refusing to share responsibility for the of PPE shortages, a disaster which could and should have been avoided. Here the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, must carry the can and admit he failed, its NHS heroes and those infected with the virus by dithering and delaying when firm, decisive leadership was most needed. When incompetence by a PM jeopardises lives, he must be held accountable. Johnson, recuperating in Chequers after his release from intensive care, has questions to answer. Our nation requires a serious leader to beat a serious threat. Instead we have Johnson. Failing the test Defying the elderly and vulnerable human contact for up to a year, leaving grandparents unable to hug grand- children, would be a grotesque cruelty. Even the possibility of this is another condemnation of the Government’s failure to create comprehensive testing that would allow people clear of the virus to mix freely.

The UK government has issued advice for the public relating to the transmission of the potentially deadly bug on food. The guidance states that it is very unlikely that you can catch coronavirus from food because respiratory illnesses are not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging, reports  North Wales Live. The Food Standards Agency gave a similar statement earlier this month. Anyone concerned about the potential contamination of coronavirus on their food however has been assured in the new guidance that, evenit was present on food, cooking thoroughly will kill the virus. The advice also urges the public to wash their hands regularly with soap and water - as has been recommended by the NHS since the beginning of the outbreak - particularly before handling food or eating. The new information stresses that the risk of coronavirus cross-contamination on food and packaging is very low.  It urges that food businesses must adhere to hygiene and safety procedures, and that staff in the industry are required to maintain a high degree of personal cleanliness and wear suitable, clean clothing. Providing advice to the public themselves, the document explains: When you are buying loose foods such as fruit, vegetables, or bread in a bakery, try and only touch what you are going to buy. Customers are also reminded that they must maintain a two metre distance between themselves and others, and only buy what you need. As mentioned previously, officials urge the public to follow general hygiene procedures when handling food - particularly in relation to raw fruit, leafy salads and vegetables.  This includes washing fresh produce to help remove any contamination on the surface and peeling outer layers of certain items. The public are however warned not to wash raw chicken or other meat as this can lead to cross-contamination in the kitchen. Additionally, the new guidance recommends using a food-safe disinfectant when cleaning surfaces - suggesting that using hot, soapy water is a suitable alternativecleaning products are in limited supply locally. The UK Government adds: If you have been shopping, there should be no need to sanitise the outer packaging of food. This is because food businesses are required to have a system for managing food safety in place, which should include keeping packaging clean. You should still follow good hygiene practice by washing your hands after handling any outer packaging. The advice says takeaway orders are not prohibited or considered particularly unsafe.

The Lyrid Meteor Shower occurs every April - putting on a spectacular light-show for stargazers. Shooting stars appear as dust from the Comet C  G Thatcher and interact with the Earth’s atmosphere. When this dust enters Earth’s atmosphere, it burns up, producing a trail of light through the sky. It takes its name from the Lyra constellation, from which the meteors appear to radiate. While it is due to start tonight, the peak of the Lyrid meteor shower will be overnight on April -, NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke told Space. The Lyrids will be visible beginning at about :pm, but are best viewed in the darkness after midnight and when urban lights have been switched off as households turn in for bed. The best time to watch is after midnight and before the light of dawn, the expert said. Check the weather forecast in your area to determine the prime time overnight to skygaze. The phenomenonaposs peak visibility time of Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning is due to the phase of the moon. It will be a thin crescent only about two days from the new moon at that time, Mr Cooke said, so the moonlight wonapost drown out the light-show. Visibility will depend on how clear and dark the night sky where you live is, Cooke said.  The expert said the average Lyrid shower produces  to  meteors per hour, and this year about  per hour are predicted - although sometimes hundreds an hour can be seen tearing across the skies. Some years, the Lyrid meteor shower can produce up to  meteors per hour in whataposs called an outburst, but it is hard to predict, Mr Cooke added. There is an average of  years between the outbursts, but the actual number of years between them ies, he said. How best to view the meteor shower during the UK lockdown The spectacular could not have come at a better time for the UK in lockdown. As we stay home to protect the NHS and stop spreading the coronavirus, those of us who are not key workers on shts should be in the perfect spot to catch the light-show. Normally, eager stargazers are urged to head to the countryside where there is less light pollution to see the meteors in all their glory. However under lockdown rules, you must not travel to the countryside.

The first message says: Tom, it’s Harry and I’m going to call you right now. Please pick up, thank you. Another reads: Tom, Harry again! Really need to speak to u. U do not need to apologize, we understand the circumstances but “going public” will only make the situation worse. If u love Meg and want to make it right please call me as there are two other options which don’t involve u having to speak to the media, who incidentally created this whole situation.

A total of ,kg of meat  from wild animals was seized by Border Agency staff at airports in  , up from kg the previous year and kg in  , according to a response by the Home Office to a freedom of information request made by the Daily Mirror. ild animals have been hunted by rural communities in Africa for many thousands of years, but in recent decades have been smuggled into cities in Britain, Europe and the USA – part of a lucrative international crime racket. Experts have warned that the bushmeat trade is not only a threat to wild animals but could result in more zoonotic diseases being transmitted to humans. Dr Ben Garrod, Professor of Evolutionary Biology and Science Engagement at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, warned: “While this global pandemic started in Wuhan, it is just as possible for the next one to start in London or Washington. Currently, animal meat and body parts are being illegally transported all around the world.  “Airlines and border agencies are great at stopping people, drugs and weapons from being smuggled. But here we are with something more fundamentally dangerous than any act of terrorism or natural disaster, yet it is allowed to go largely unchecked. “Until those transporting products of animal origins internationally are stopped, we are going to see primates, pangolins and other exotic, endangered animals coming into the UK, Europe, USA and Asia. Unless that stops we are going to see more epidemics and more species in decline.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pubs could remain closed until","story":"NewsPubs could remain closed until at least Christmas in massive blow for tradeA pub trade insider has admitted boozers may not survivethey are kept locked down until the winter, having already lost millions with Euro  postponed until next yearShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video pubs-restaurants-among-last-lockdown-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news pubs-could-remain-closed-until-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But while the UKaposs lockdown shows no signs of letting up, being outdoors is not banned as authorities say spending time in nature could help with the nationaposs physical and mental wellbeing. As long as government guidelines on social-distancing are being followed, people are allowed to leave their homes in certain circumstances. Previously, the public were told they could only go outdoors to exercise once per day, to buy essential goods and to travel to workit was not possible to work from home. But new police guidelines have  expanded on that list, with officers being told to consider a string of scenarios that could be deemed reasonable under coronavirus lockdown rules. The Government has also asked councils to keep parks open, stating access was necessary for the health of the nation, while grieving families have been told they can now attend funerals and visit graveyards. Here is a list of things you are allowed to do outdoors...  .

There was a plethora of famous and well-known guests who all had a great day in the glorious Easter weather.The photos showed Barbie and Louis getting ready for their big day, other dolls toys arriving for the ceremony, Barbie throwing the bouquet and the bride and standing in their dress and tux in front of a gorgeous sunset.

The images, which were first released by state-owned China Daily newspaper in , were published again last month on Twitter before being deleted. In the pictures the seal to one of the refrigerators inside the lab appears flimsy and loose, while a lab worker dressed in gloves and a mask can be seen pulling out a box which contains virus samples. Minsters said earlier this month that there are fears the global pandemic may have started from a leak in one of the labs storing the deadly virus. It has previously been claimed that Wuhan Institute of Virology, where it is alleged coronavirus may have been leaked from, has been carrying out experiments on bats from the cave believed to be the source of the  coronavirus  pandemic. The  Mail on Sunday  reports that that the Institute has been carrying out research on bats captured from caves in Yunnan, where the Covid- genome is thought to have come from. The caves are , miles away from Wuhan, the Chinese city which is now infamous for having been the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic. Scientists say it is highly likely that Covid- first came from bats, but first passed through an intermediary animal before jumping to humans. The Wuhan lab has previously dismissed allegations that coronavirus came from their facility, while the Chinese Embassy has described speculation around the labaposs activities as hasty and reckless allegations.  Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves. Chinese scientist Shi Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic. She said: What we have uncovered is just the tip of an iceberg. The mission must go on. Bat-borne coronaviruses will cause more outbreaks and we must find them before they find us.

john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed and they can work on survival plans for their clubs.“It is time now toour focus on staying safe and planning for the future of Dundee FC.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their

for the third time last month by Neil Rothnie Architecture on behalf of Ciysel Sofra Ltd for the site at Sclattie Park in Bucksburn.They proposed turning the former shop into a daytime takeaway food outlet, selling products such as chips, macaroni, paninis, soup, hot drinks and bakery goods.However, several objections were made on the application.Now, the council has said no further decision will be made on the site.Robert Forbes, senior planner at Aberdeen City Council, said: “It is noted that two similar planning applications have previously been lodged with the city council seeking change of use of the premises.“A planning application for the same development as the current proposal was refused at committee on May   and subsequently dismissed at appeal on September  .“Subsequently, you submitted a further similar application for planning permission for the site, albeit for a mixed use, which was refused under delegated powers on November  .“Where Scottish Ministers have, within the previous two years, refused permission on a similar application at appeal and, in the opinion of the planning authority, there has been no signicant change in the relevant parts of the development plan or other material considerations since that decision, the planning authority can refuse to deal with the application.“As there has been a dismissed appeal for a similar application within the last two years and it is considered that there have not been any signicant changes in the relevant parts of the development plan, or in any other material considerations which apply to the current application, within the subsequent period, I hereby noty you that I have exercised the power to decline to determine the planning application.”Kerry McKenzie, who owned the butcher shop that was previously in the space, wrote to the council stating there was a lack of demand for continued retail use – which the developers had argued there was.He added: “My trading accounts are filed at Companies House and show a trading loss for about five years prior to ceasing trading in March .“The shop then lay empty for a year while I as the shop owner attempted to find a financially viable alternative use for the shop to avoid boarding up the premises.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/5e8c3a00c5bb77.63616741-scaled.jpg ","title":"dons chief cormack calls for premiership plan","story":"Dons chairman Dave Cormack has called on the SPFL to come up with a plan to finish the Premiership season.The Aberdeen supremo has warned it’s costing the Reds £ million for every month without games.After the wrangling around the SPFL’s resolution to end Championship, League One and League Two – which finally passed last week – Cormack says the focus should now be on a contingency plan for the top flight.There has been plenty of debate about why the league body’s proposal was passed after Dundee asked for their initial “no” vote not to stand and then eventually voted for the resolution.But Cormack says we need to move on from how that happened.The Pittodrie chief said: “The four key aspects for us at Aberdeen are: how can we get back playing football safely and survive  How do we end the Premiership  What about the taskforce, what are its terms of reference  And how do we draw a line in the sand on this investigation and what happened “We can sit and talk for hours about what happened and why it’s happened – but look, it’s happened and we need to learn from this.“I said to Neil Doncaster ‘ I were in your position, which I’m not and wouldn’t want to be, then I would show some contrition for what’s happened’.“It’s clearly a vote that was forced down our throats in many ways and that’s obvious.“It’s costing other clubs dferent amounts, but what we want at Aberdeen is to see some clear leadership from the SPFL to set out terms of reference for when we can get back to playing football safely.“What are the work streams medically  Let’s look at behind closed doors. You look at the English Premier League and English Football League.“Right now there is documentation about them finishing their leagues and there’s tens of millions on the line so they have to play them.“I’m assured that this work starts , but I think it’s really important for the executive of the SPFL, led by Neil Doncaster, to take leadership and he’ll get as much support as he needs from Aberdeen.”In England the Premier League and Football League have been working on plans to complete the campaign to fulfil their lucrative broadcasting demands.Cormack believes Scotland should be trying to do similar, but hopes Uefa’s meeting this week may lead to some clarity.There is a conference call tomorrow with nations and the executive committee of Uefa meet on Thursday.Cormack added: “The meetings with Uefa may lead to some decisions being made.“Meanwhile, in England, we know they are working on what is an aggressive schedule to finish their games because of the broadcasting revenue.“If we had £m on the line to finish the season then I guarantee we’d find a way of playing these games.“How long is a piece of string  We need to know what Uefa says. We said as a club last week it was unlikely and even remote.“But our point is that we didn’t get a chance to discuss this fully as clubs.“The mistake that was made was trying to force thisthrough in two days. It was a complex document and people have dferent interests.“The important needs of the lower league teams are dferent to the needs of the Premiership.”The passing of the resolution gives the SPFL board the power to declare the Premiership campaign over. Cormack has been given assurances that call won’t be made without consultation with the  clubs.He said: “The SPFL board with the vote going through have been given the ability to make that call on their own.“But I don’t believe that decision will be made in isolation to all  clubs without us having a conversation.“It might be so simple and so obvious that Uefa comes out with it and says the leagues are ended and that takes it away from everybody.“The key thing for us is that we’re looking down the barrel of a gun in some shape or formwe’re not playing football in three, four or five months from now.“All our energy should be going into how we move on from here and evaluating things like closed door games.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt.

A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us.

Even with thoughts of lugging heavy panniers full of day-to-day necessary detritus.Even knowing Id have to scrap with private hire drivers at junctions and dodge buses in cycle lanes.Thats a large part of the current joy. No scrapping, no narrow misses, no stress.The roads are so much emptier that the nagging fear always following at my shoulder, that heightened sense of potential doom, is gone.There are streets so quiet on my route that you can almost forget about motorised traffic and freewheel, carefree up the middle of the road. It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

I am determined to keep the pressure up on booking and protect my constituents.\":Coronavirus in Scotland: Ian Blackford calls for all Highland accommodation to close in bid to stop spread of COVID-All political parties have expressed concern over people attempting to escape cities and towns to rural and isolated parts of Scotland, in a bid to evade contracting the virus. But the behaviour results in too many people arriving in locations that have less resources to deal with an increase in patients, who need specialist and often intensive care facilities.Scottish communities angrily reacted to the influx in visitors - some resorting to barricading lay-bys and would-be camping areas - warning that their already-under pressure local health services cannot cope with the extra strain.Last month, a military aircraft was needed to transport a critically-ill coronavirus patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.This led to the Scottish Government announcing that ferries services were now to only be used for islanders, allowing them to continue essential journeys.Even before the official lockdown was put in place, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told accommodation providers to stop accepting bookings - a message reiterated ahead of what would have been the Easter holidays.A Scottish Government spokesperson, said: ldquoWe need everyone to stay at home to help us save lives and protect our NHS.\"We also need businesses to help us achieve this.

Again. Irsquom lying in bed, have been for half an hour, trying to beat back the fragments of thoughts, the noisy nonsense of insomnia, breathing in and out, my brain churning through indefinable problems which probably donrsquot even really exist, until finally, I admit defeat, walk downstairs, make myself a cup of caffeine-free tea and try to work. My only company is the birdsong ndash and, perhaps, you. Because I know, during this lockdown and pandemic, there are others out there, somewhere in this city, somewhere in the land, somewhere on Twitter. This is lockdown. Days and nights donrsquot work like they used to.They neither work for those of us trapped in our homes in quarantine, nor for those on the frontline. One study found that one-third of healthcare workers suffered insomnia during the Covid- epidemic in China. Those reporting sleeplessness were also more likely to feel depressed, anxious, and have stress-based trauma. I canrsquot help feeling my own sleep struggles are nothing compared with the torment of being unable to drop off while also knowing you have to go, exhausted, into a hospital the next day, to do your work of trying to save lives, perhaps with equipment that is inadequate.But all of us listen to the news. All of us have heard the stories about the extension of lockdown, the impact on the economy, the rising figures in intensive care, the elderly dying in care homes. Almost all of us have lost the routines that kept us rooted. Almost all of us are worrying about something or somebody. We are all in touch with the collective trauma of this pandemic.Sleep expert Dr Donn Posner, speaking at a Hard TH Chan School of Public Health online forum, recently described the current pandemic, with its lockdown conditions, as a ldquoperfect storm of sleep problems. He observed: ldquoThe actions that wersquore taking to protect ourselves can not only precipitate problems with sleep, but lead to chronic problems with sleep.We probably all know the common advice on whatrsquos called better sleep hygiene ndash donrsquot drink caffeine after lunchtime, avoid too much alcohol, do plenty of exercise, turn off your screens in the evening, create a bedtime routine, meditate, aim for around seven hours sleep, avoid daytime napping. Yet that advice doesnrsquot seem quite adequate for these times of fear and social distancing. Our bodies are bound to react to the combination of being cooped up and under the kind of stress that triggers the fight-or-flight response. One clinical psychologist, Lucy Johnstone, interviewed by Wired last week, noted: ldquoI think itrsquos important not to medicalise our responses, whether emotional or physical, and of course these are intertwined. Personally, I would be more concerned about someone who is not feeling alarmed by the threats we are facing.In my view, worse than insomnia is worrying about insomnia. Even sleep experts like Posner advise not trying to force ityou canrsquot sleep. ldquoGood sleepers, he says, ldquoput no effort into sleep whatsoever. Thats why Im up and working. That and the fact that I do think there may be a place for working our fears out during the night. Waking in the early hours may simply be a natural response to what wersquore collectively going through.LETHARGYJust as the nights are wakeful, so are the days slumpy.

As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance. Thatrsquos the common theme.The Unremembered Places by Patrick Baker is published by Birlinn on May "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  an army at work on the home front","story":"It wasnrsquot until we moved to the country that I needed a diary the way fish need water. We got the keys to the cottage on a brilliantly frosty Friday and moved our belongings in over the weekend. Until then, wersquod forgotten that we had nothing to sleep on. Two nights in a nearby hotel was our last experience of domestic warmth for many months to come. A mattress was delivered on the Monday, which was also the day the first tradespeople arrived, to measure for shutters. With Christmas looming, we needed to put things in place as fast as possible, ahead of the long festive shutdown or, as that chapter in our memoirs will read, The Big Freeze.It would be quicker to tell you who hasnrsquot been over the door these past two years. Thanks to ill-fitting windows, draughty doors, a leaking roof, and a central heating system suffering from poor circulation, for the first three months I worked in the kitchen, as close to the boiler as I could get. Some books are kept under wraps until the day of publication, but the one I was battling with was typed from beneath layers of thermals, wool and eiderdown, with a hot water bottle on my lap where once there had been a cat.The extent of our igloo-like crisis was brought home the day we stood in front of the French windows, discussing triple glazing with the man from Everest. His breath and ours met as we spoke, sending up a mushroom cloud above the packing boxes. Snow fell steadily outside, blown sideways by a gale, like a film directorrsquos idea of a backwoods scene. Somehow it also managed to get inside, through the jambs. At this point the comparison with an igloo, which is better built and insulated, collapses.In the months since, we feel aswersquove got to know half of the Bordersrsquo tradesmen. Each week the diary has been stuffed with appointments, as we set about tackling all our problems, some immediately evident, others only making themselves known after stormy weather or excavation.The local economy must surely have taken an upturn since we arrived. Diary entries from the week we arrived to the Friday before lockdown began show that we have had window fitters, joiners , plumbers, heating engineers, roofers, painters, locksmiths, glaziers, IT experts, telephone engineer, loft insulators, pest controller, kitchen fitters, electricians, wood-burning stove suppliers, carpet cleaners, carpet layers, stone masons, carpenters, plasterers, chimney sweep, fencers, drystone dykers, and a landscape gardener, all contributing to the home front.We even had a man with a scythe to tackle the so-called lawn which, after a fortnightrsquos absence in the first springtime, had turned into a waist-high meadow. After that he came every two weeks with his Rolls-Royce of a lawnmower and extendable shears, to keep the ancient beech hedge under control. Hisevery spring after the long winter is a bright spot on the calendar.Men ndash and apart from one Polish window fitter and a locksmith who replaced several door latches they have all been men ndash have inspected the chimneys by binoculars and ladder, crept into the crawl space under the roof with torch in mouth, and delved beneath floors in an attempt to trace the labyrinth of pipes. Irsquove seen the original th-century lath and plasterwork exposed in the kitchen, and been shown a field drain predating the cottage at the front. The old cart house at the back, which later became a cobblerrsquos, was reached by a flagged path, and remnants of this, which had served for  years and more, were exposed when our tumbledown old wall was rebuilt. That would explain why, previously, whenever Alan attempted to drive a spade into this part of the garden he would shudder ashersquod had an electric shock.Clearing the front flowerbed a couple of weeks ago, I pulled out a long-buried rubber pipe, perished with age, which disappeared, goodness knows where, under the Buddleia. While I was tugging, Alan came upon a smooth oval stone, so hefty he could barely budge it. It was either the mould for a giant Easter egg, or the first rugby ball in the Borders.If there is one common factor with the army that has worked on the house, it is rugby. An astonishing number of tradesmen are either players or former players. All but a very few are avid followers. One chap was undergoing treatment for his latest injuries when he first turned up, having on earlier occasions broken his back and a leg at play. He was clearly in a lot of pain but, several months and many injections later, he was finally fit to rejoin his team.Give how physical their work is, you can see why so many of them are sportsmen. There was one young man who, unbeknownst to us, was clambering around our rooftop without any sign of a harness, nearly giving our neighbour across the green palpitations. For the space of five days while he worked, the front door stood wide open ndash it was January ndash but when I askedthe cold bothered him, he said he liked it. He never put the heating on in his flat.Two months later, in the wake of the Beast from the East, the kitchen was installed and the door stood ajar for a further five days. This time I had to work upstairs, typing in rhythm to the bass beat on the joinerrsquos radio, and thereby generating a frisson of heat. He too seemed not to notice the Arctic blast. All of them seem exceptionally tough and strong. Which is just as well, because therersquos a lot more work still to do."},{"url":null,"title":"carina-contini-three-great-recipes-approaching-summer","story":"A TINY part of me has to admit that deep down the lockdown has felt like getting a day off school when I was eight years old due to the February snowfalls.

Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis.

There are some other countries that are relaxing some aspects of their existing restraints. They are confident they can do so without prejudice to the overall health of their populations. We are looking at what those countries are doing, we are looking at our own data and evidence.ldquoBut one of the things we absolutely will not do is precipitately relax any of the current restrictions before we are confident that we have a scientic check in the round that allows us to make the right decisions.The Cabinet Office Minister told Sky Newss Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \"It is the case that we are looking at all of the evidence but we have set some tests which need to be passed before we can think of easing restrictions in this lockdown.\"It is entirely understandable, of course, that there should be a public debate about how we approach these dficult choices.\"Later, Mr Gove made clear the Government was developing a strategy for so-called ldquocontact trace and testing, so people could be tested in the community and be tracked through the use of technology. He mentioned a telephone app that could help in this regard.He stressed UK ministers were taking a ldquodeliberately cautious and measured approach guided by the science and that a number of things had to happen before the Government was confident enough to begin to lt the restrictions these included testing and contact tracing, the NHS capacity being as resilient as it could be and that the number of deaths was falling.ldquoIt is onlywe can be certain that we have all of those factors in place we can confident about relaxing some of the measures we currently have in place, explained the Cabinet minister.Askedthere would be contact tracing within the community within three weeks, Mr Gove said ldquoover the course of the next few weeks the Government would be able to increase the number of tests and made clear he was ldquoconfident it would meet its target of , a day by the end of this month the current number of tests remains just over , a day while the capacity is , a day.He told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show: ldquoIt is also the case we hope to have community testing as well but I canrsquot give you a precise timescale. We are working as fast as we can to ensure we can increase the number of tests and also develop contact-tracing infrastructure.Asked about the Government telephone app, the Scot explained: ldquoIt is in beta-testing, at the moment. One of the things we want to ensure is that when we start operating at signicant scale we want to make sure it is robust and that it works.ldquoIt is better to have no app than a bad app to paraphrase a principle we have outlined in respect to testing. We are currently developing it. We are making sure it is inter-operable with other apps that other countries are developing as well.Earlier, Gavin Williamson, the UK Education Secretary, took to social media to dismiss an imminentto school in England.He tweeted: \"No decision has been made on when we will reopen schools. I can reassure schools and parents that they will only reopen when the scientic advice indicates it is the right time to do so.\"Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Governments Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies[SAGE], said he was \"optimistic\" about finding a vaccine for the Covid- coronavirus with advances in science.But he acknowledged \"the truth is we dont have another vaccine for any other human coronavirus\" and said finding a safe and effective treatment for the latest strain was \"not a given\".He told Sky News: \"I hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year - but thats a vaccine in a vial, its a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective.\"Its crucial to realise having a vaccine in itself, in say a million doses, which you know to be safe and you believe to be effective. That is not the end game.\"The end game is making sure that it is truly effective. Its effective in the elderly, effective in young children, effective right across the age group in all populations.\"And then you have to manufacture that in billions of doses to administer them to the world. That is an enormous scientic challenge, its also an enormous logistics and delivery challenge,\" he added.Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said a shipment of PPE that was due to arrive in the country was \"a few days supply\" and \"may be enough to avert an absolute crisis over this weekend\" but added that \"it doesnt solve the longer term problem\".Meanwhile, speaking about Mr Johnsons health following his treatment for coronavirus, Mr Gove said: \"The Prime Minister is recovering well. Hes in cheerful spirits. He had the opportunity to talk to Dominic Raab, his deputy, the First Secretary of State, on Friday.\"And the Prime Ministers instructions to the rest of us in Government were communicated by the First Secretary of State when we had a conference call yesterday morning.\"Mr Johnson was treated for Covid- in intensive care at St Thomass Hospital in London earlier this month and is now recuperating at his official country home of Chequers in Buckinghamshire."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-archers-go-memory-lane","story":"Whatrsquos the aim The producers of the BBC Radio  drama say the episodes re-broadcast will feature ldquoimportant moments from the last two decades of the programme, ldquogiving new listeners new insight or simply offering a chance to reminisce.It comes as Amid the fallout from the pandemic, it is taking longer than expected to produce new episodes.

What prompted the Scot to reveal this new talent was the same thing that led the US President to let rip last week ndash a newspaper report.Mr Trump was furious over a New York Times article that said he had failed to heed expertsrsquo warnings about coronavirus, and as a result precious weeks had been wasted in preparing for the coming disaster.The Sunday Times, under the headline, ldquoRevealed ndash how the government sleepwalked into pandemic catastrophe, essentially laid the same charge at the door of Boris Johnson and his government.In particular, the paperrsquos Insight investigation team said Mr Johnson missed five meetings of the COBRA emergency committee. Moreover, ministers sent to China hundreds of thousands of items of Personal Protection Equipment , material currently in short supply in some places.Serious charges. Important, then, that they be tackled head on. As luck or planning would have it, the Minister on Sunday duty was Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the man usually called upon when the Government has fires to put out.Fireman Michael had quite a sht to put in. Before getting to the Sunday Times he had to damp down acres of speculation about the lting of social distancing rules ndash the Great Unlocking as opposed to the Great Lockdown. The first to get back to normal, the Sunday papers reported, would be schools on May .Mr Gove put his red pen through that suggestion. ldquoNot true.Ridge turned to the Sunday Times story, askingPPE had been sent to China. Mr Gove refused to engage. ldquoI wonrsquot get into a to and fro.Adopting the disappointed teacher persona she does so well, Ridge moved on to Mr Johnson and the missed meetings.She reminded Mr Gove of what he had said in  when he withdrew his backing for Mr Johnsonrsquos leadership bid and entered the race himself. To wit: ldquoBoris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. Had he proved that correct ldquoThe idea that the Prime Minister skipped meetings that were vital to our response to the coronavirus is grotesque, said an increasingly animated Mr Gove.Next on Ridge on Sunday was Jon Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, who was not impressed by the Govester. ldquoThe weakest rebuttal of a detailed expose in British political history.Consider Labourrsquos period of ldquoconstructive engagement with the Government over, or at least as far as Mr Ashworth goes.Mr Gove finished his interview with Ridge before am. He had under an hour before he appeared on The Andrew Marr Show. More stonewalling would not do.He had his answers ready this time. The PM had not attended the five meetings, but that was because such discussions were led by the relevant Secretary of State. The UK did send PPE to China but it was not from the UKrsquos pandemic stock, and the UK had received far more than it gave.His dander up, Mr Gove, a former journalist, attacked the messenger. One was reminded of the Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction, in which a gangster threatened to ldquoget medieval on someonersquos ldquoa**.The Minister fumed: ldquoIf you wrench facts out of context in order to create a particular prosecution case you can do that, of course you can do that, but it doesnrsquot do justice to the whole story.ldquoWhat I found grotesque ndash GROTESQUE, Andrew ndash was the idea that our Prime Minister should be portrayed as not caring about this when anyone who has seen him lead the response to this crisis will know his focus, his energy, his determination, his passion, has been to beat this virus.ldquoThatrsquos why I was, as I said with a level of Aberdonian understatement, a wee bit concerned about it.Aberdonian understatement indeed. He was furious. Trump-level furious.The morningrsquos most eloquent communicator, a bringer of light rather than heat, turned out to be a person of science rather than a politician.Sarah Gilbert, the Oxford professor leading one of the searches for a vaccine, told Marr she hoped to start clinical trials next week.Clear, informative, persuasive while not overstating her case, Prof Gilbert said it was vital that the Government help set up manufacturing facilities in the UK that could produce a vaccine on a massive scale.Interview over, Marr said his thanks. ldquoRight, said the prof, pushing her chair back, ldquoIrsquoll get back to work.As another wise soul once said,you want something done, ask a busy person.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

All the countries of the world are in a state of financial crisis. We must get back to where we were before we consider further radical change. If we ever do, that is...The other strand of thought goes: The place we were before, with the UK Government sacricing health and social careon the altar of profit, prioritising jingoistic wars over the war on poverty and ignoring the suggestions of the Scottish Government to take a dferent route was how we got in this mess. We must take this chance to overhaul the system and find a new way.As the UK Government keeps telling us, our last upheaval of such magnitude was the Second World War. People cheered Churchill for winning the war, but this did not blind them to the need for fundamental change. At the first opportunity they voted the Tories out and brought in a Labour Government. The remnants of the innovations brought in by Attlees Government, though watered down by subsequent Tory and Labour Governments, are what we rely on to save us today.At the end of this crisis we must take the chance for fundamental change, for the chance will not come again.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.TOM Gordon is right to consider how Covid- has damaged the cause of independence . But Covid is not the only problem for the true believers in the one true church of Scottish nationalism.The first real crack in the campaign for independence was losing the  referendum. The next, in the eyes of most Scots, was refusing to accept the democratic result of that referendum. The next wound, this time self-inflicted, was the report of the SNPs own Sustainable Growth Commission. The Commission was set up by the SNP to provide an economic case for the break-up of the UK but merely succeeded in revealing that the case was as weak as its opponents had said, and would it require at least a decade of deep austerity just toto current level of prosperity, after which time we might, just maybe, meet the criteria for EU membership. Then came Brexit. The pain and distress caused by attempting to disentangle our -year partial union with Europe only served to highlight the futility of trying to break up our three hundred year-old all-encompassing union with England.As for Covid: the First Minister is fond of claiming this or that event as a ldquomaterial change, justying the need for a second independence referendum. The irony is that the Covid pandemic is a real material change, but not in favour of her campaign. Covid shows the value of the Union and the advantages of having a large and strong economy, a huge network of academic, industrial and medical expertise on hand to address the existential problems and strong enough to absorb economic and societal shocks far out of the ordinary. And please dont mention the oil price.Mr Gordon is right: Covid- is a serious challenge to the true believers in independence. But in reality, the case for independence was always weak.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, Largs.TOM Gordons contention that the UK has been better together ignores the appalling lack of preparation shown by the Westminster Government in dealing with the virus together with a lack of transparency and ineffectual leadership. The First Minster has been resolute and empathetic consistently and inspires a confidence that Boris Johnson and his assorted chums can only dream of.Mr Gordons supine argument against independence appears to boil down to the attempted economic rescue plan from the Treasury that will, hopefully, mitigate against the worst excesses of the effects of the virus on our economic lives. An independent Scotland, hopefully as members of the EU, would not only be in a position to reinvigorate our economic le but would also benefit from support from other EU nations which, post Brexit, will undoubtedly hamper economic resurgence in the UK, regardless of Mr Gordons threadbare hopes.It is interesting to note that the Irish republics reaction to the pandemic was not only quicker in cancelling sports events, closing businesses and in adopting a pragmatic, dogma-free style of leadership than the UK. It was also more effective in controlling the virus and initiating large-scale testing amongst the population and,when adjusted for population figures, Britain has suffered more than twice the amount of deaths than Ireland has at present. An independent Scotland, as Nicola Sturgeon continues to demonstrate, would be just as prepared and efficient as any other country in the world, the more sowe were unfettered from the clumsy and inept shackles of Westminster.Owen Kelly, Stirling.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

Itrsquos also the job of journalists to point out how badly other people are running the country. Irsquom yet to be convinced they should be running it themselves.:Cabinet ministers rally behind Johnson after suggestion he was missing in action at start of virus outbreakBut this is what crises like coronavirus do: they reveal, and expose, what people are like, but they also transform, and change, people too, and Irsquod be surprisedthe Prime Ministerrsquos time in hospital hasnrsquot changed him in some way. Speak to doctors and nurses and theyrsquoll tell you that intensive care has a profound effect on anyone whorsquos ever been a patient there. You tend to reassess your le when death brushes up against you.The changes,any, that have happened to Mr Johnson may become clear in time, but we can hope for one at least. Some of the nurses who treated him in hospital were migrants whorsquod come to the UK to work in the NHS and yoursquod like to think that fact would make the PM reconsider the benefits of immigration and go for a dferent kind of Brexit. In that sense, perhaps the coronavirus will have shted him a little to the left.You wonder toothe effect is more widespread: we now have a Tory government, so recently wreathed in austerity grey, that has overseen an unprecedented expansion in state benefits and support, paid for by a massive increase in public debt ndash no wonder the new Labour leader Keir Starmer is struggling to find something to disagree with. The crisis has also made some people reconsider their political assumptions, which is only right and proper: many facts have changed, so many opinions must change too.My hope is that the effect will work on everyone to some extent: left, right, Remain, Leaver, unionist, nationalist. For example, Irsquod like to think that some of the Scots whorsquove been inclined towards independence will ask themselves whether coronavirus doesnrsquot demonstrate the social and economic benefits of nations working together in unions.Equally, other people may be thinking again about what the state should be doing for its citizens and I hope that would include the PM, although it wonrsquot be easy for him ndash as a journalist and politician, hersquos railed against the nanny state now, suddenly, he finds himself wearing nannyrsquos apron.That second category ndash people whorsquove looked again at their views on state support ndash is particularly interesting and I would certainly include myself in that group. Irsquove seen lots of friends lose their businesses and incomes in the last few weeks and Irsquove seen them try to access state benefits or the other government schemes. Itrsquos been upsetting and unsettling and in the end it may not even work ndash therersquos no guarantee theyrsquoll get what they need to see them through.In some ways, whatrsquos happened has exposed the problems with any kind of means-tested system: it takes time to process, it costs a lot of money, and it can lead to unfair cut-offs between people in similar circumstances. But there are problems with universal benefits too: theyrsquore also expensive and you spend some of the money on people who donrsquot need it. Both systems have their drawbacks.However, the Covid crisis has particularly underlined the problems with our current set-up. The sudden influx of people needing help means a lot of bureaucracy and expense itrsquos also inefficient, potentially unfair, and inclined towards abuse. We know, for example, that a lot of people who are entitled to help have not appliedconversely, some companies have furloughed staff while getting them to do work on the side.All of this bureaucracy and abuse could potentially have been avoided ndash and I find it hard to believe Irsquove come round to an idea I wouldrsquove once considered loony left-wing ndash by a system that works to a basic, bottom-line income thatrsquos paid no matter your circumstances. It would mean everyone would be guaranteed a basic level of support without having to go through a long process to access it and we would not be facing such a sudden and catastrophic surge in spending. There are also good, Conservative reasons for supporting a universal income provided it came with a reduction in other benefits: it would make the pubic sector smaller, andit improves peoplersquos health, it might reduce the cost of the NHS.The NHS, as it happens, as well as social care, is another area where reassessment is going on. To some extent, therersquos been a little bit of cant in the criticism of the government handling of coronavirus ndash an unprecedented crisis situation is never going to go entirely smoothly and it should be judged by the circumstance of the crisis rather than before it. But for a long time the UK and Scottish governments have talked about spending increases on the NHS and social care without addressing the question of whether we are spending enough. At the end of all this, we urgently need a realistic assessment of what the system actually needs.We should question other shibboleths too. Even where I am in the middle of nowhere in Ayrshire Irsquove been appreciating the lack of cars on the road and planes in the sky it was so quiet the other day I heard a sheep fart. So perhaps, for a start, we could address the ludicrous cheapness of air travel by taxing it more heavily ndash certainly, the SNPrsquos been moving on the issue and has repudiated its old policy of big cuts for airlines. A lot of people might also be much more sympathetic now than they were towards financial disincentives on owning cars.:Mark Smith: The problem with the Scottish Governmentrsquos laws on Covid  They donrsquot go far enoughIrsquom not saying any of these ideas are madly radical and Irsquom not saying my sympathy for them qualies me as a leftie. But this crisis has changed the lives of every person in the country, and principles and assumptions that we took for granted have been undermined or swept away altogether.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

The project came about when Village Blinds was forced to close temporarily due to the ongoing COVID- pandemic.“Although we had taken the decision to close temporarily, we wanted to do something to help in providing a product or service for our incredible NHS staff and care workers,” explained Harold. “With the urgent need for scrubs so highly documented, we knew this was something practical that we could help with.”With many fabric manufacturers also closed temporarily, Harold struggled to source a bulk fabric initially, until he spoke to Kevin Devlin, managing director of fabric manufacturer William Clark and Sons in Upperlands, Maghera.“Kevin kindly agreed to bring back some of his staff to produce the fabric we neededwe placed a minimum order of , metres,” continued Harold. “A friend immediately launched a fundraising campaign to raise the five-figure sum required to buy the fabric and, within days, we exceeded our target thanks to the kindness and generosity of hundreds of people.”“We had then started to cut and distribute the fabrics within our own factory to enable our stitcher volunteers to get to work. With the demand being so pressing, however, we had to switch to auto machine cutting of the scrubs, working with Bradfor’s from Rostrevor, who kindly offered their services free of charge. This allowed the , metres of fabric to be cut into pieces ready for stitching.”Harold and Alison distributed the fabric to what they described as “an exceptional band of stitchers”, made up of over  volunteers spread right across Mid and East Antrim – including Ballymena, Broughshane, Cullybackey, Cloughmills, Ahoghill and Larne. Groups involved included ‘Bannside Stitchers’, ‘Cloughmills Crochet Club’ and ‘Tullygarley Sewing Group’.“We are deeply indebted to each and every person involved either with the groups or as iniduals for their help and expertise,” said Harold. “Many of these amazing women are well over the age of  themselves and have been in isolation for weeks. With many of them professional stitchers from days gone by, the speed at which they have been able to work is outstanding and the workmanship and quality coming back from them is absolutely impeccable.“This project has had a hugely positive impact on them in one way or another. As well as being physically unwell, many of them were feeling very down and isolated by the ongoing lockdown. The opportunity to use their talent and skill in this way has really brought new le to them.”Harold and Alison have been operating a drop off and pick up service, distributing fabric to stitchers across the borough and picking up dozens of pairs of completed scrubs just days later.Over , pairs of scrubs are now in the process of being distributed, with some having gone already to Antrim and Causeway Hospitals and a number of nursing homes in Mid and East Antrim, as well as in Lisburn and Belfast.A collective statement from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Group Party Leaders – Councillors Gregg McKeen, Timothy Gaston, Keith Turner, Gerardine Mulvenna, Eugene Reid and James McKeown – praised Harold and Alison and their group of volunteers for their efforts.“In recent weeks we have seen many fantastic examples of businesses in Mid and East Antrim being proactive and really going out to their way to do anything they can to help in the fight against COVID-.“Harold and Alison McCloy, their ‘band of stitchers’ and all those who helped with this project in any way, are to be commended for this remarkable display of thoughtfulness, selflessness and generosity. Exemplying the outward-looking values that characterise the people of Mid and East Antrim, their kindness will be felt by hundreds of frontline NHS and care workers at a time of great need.”Harold and Alison are continuing to raise funds throughout the campaign, with new project being planned to help the NHS and local charities.

But it doesn#t have to be that way, says child development expert Anita Cleare.Cleare runs the Positive Parenting Project , through which she delivers talks, workshops and coaching for parents. She has just written The Work Parent Switch, which looks at the issues working parents face and how to overcome them.She says: Working parents have been told the way to be successful is to be hyper-organised, buy five years# worth of birthday cards at once and batch-freeze meals, but that goes against the grain of what children really need from us.Good relationships with children are built on quality moments, not on constantly chivying our kids from task to task.To create a happy family le, working parents need to step out of their hyper-efficient work mindset and be playful and curious, so they can tune in to our children#s signals and understand the world from their point of view.Here, Cleare suggests six ways to be a happy working parent:. Learn to switch out of work-modeThe biggest challenge for working parents is learning to switch between two dferent mindsets - work-mode and parent-mode.When we#re in work-mode, we tend to be very goal-focused and task-oriented. But when it comes to family le, children need us to deploy dferent strengths.They need emotionally attuned parents who are curious, playful and empathetic, who can slow down and prioritise connecting and listening over getting the job done.Children are naturally chaotic and focused on the moment. If we approach them stuck in our efficiency-focused work-mode, we quickly get frustrated with them.. Make space for playfulnessPlayfulness is an essential ingredient in happy families. Children and adults need it. If you take the playfulness out of parenting, all you#re left with is drudgery.Playfulness isn#t the same as doing lots of activities. Cajoling a herd of children in and out of the car to ballet rehearsals and football matches when lockdown is over doesn#t add up to a fun family le. Similarly, while we might be stuck indoors a bit more at the moment, a bit of silliness is good for everyone.Creating more space for playfulness will give you room to breathe, to relax, to laugh a little moreand enjoy being a member of your family.. Prioritise quality momentsWhen we#re stuck in get-the-job-done work-mode, we tend to focus on all those tasks that need completing during family time. Feeding, washing, laundry, spelling homework, reading, telling off, chasing down lost items...But families are made up of relationships, not tasks. If we sht our thinking about parenting away from a list of activities to be completed or a project to be undertaken and see our job as parents in terms of building relationships with our children, that opens the door to a very dferent dynamic.Building a relationship is about chatting, laughing and slowing down for a few minutes to listen when our children have something to say - really listening with all our attention, not just half our brains. It#s through listening that we connect with our children on a deeper level and get to know them.. Use your attention smartlyWhen we#re busy, it#s easy to slip into the trap of ignoring children when they#re being good and overreacting to behaviour we don#t like. Your attention means everything to your children and they#ll do pretty much anything to get it.Working parents are often racked with guilt about not being able to give their children enough attention. But it#s not how much attention we give that#s the crucial issue, it#s where we direct it.Creating a happy family dynamic isn#t about finding extra hours or minutes, it#s about parenting smarter by targeting your attention towards the behaviour you want to encourage.. Set children up to succeedAvoid constant firefighting by setting some clear, simple and positive ground rules. Children are used to having golden rules at school or nursery, so have some at home too. The best rules help children focus on what good behaviour looks like, so they do it more often.If the kids are bickering, introduce a ground rule like #be a team# to encourage alternative behaviour. If mean comments are the issue, then #use kind words# might be a good rule. Or,physical aggression is the problem, #be gentle#.. Don#t try to do it allParental involvement is a great thing, but taking over and doing too much for our children isn#t good for them. Running around picking up after children who are old enough to do things for themselves is not an act of love, it#s an act of developmental sabotage.It means you#ll never have enough time to enjoy being a member of your family.Sometimes, when it comes to parenting, less really is more.The Work Parent Switch by Anita Cleare is published by Vermilion on April , £.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There will be a very high price to paywe get it wrong.We#re already looking at what has gone wrong, but I would say the biggest mistake that has been made has been to not take this virus seriously enough.This isn#t a rehearsal, this is real and people are dying. We are beginning to see less people dying, but that doesn#t mean we can relax.It might be inconvenient to have to stay at home, but the choice is very simple. If sitting in the house for a few weeks is the price you have to pay to stay alive, it seems to me to be a fairly good price. You will have the rest of your le to make up for isolating now.While statistics released by the Public Health Agency on Sunday show  people in Northern Ireland have now died, the total death toll is likely to be signicantly higher.This follows the publication of new figures on Friday, showing Covid- deaths were a third higher than originally reported.Another  people have tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to ,, with a total of , iniduals tested.Dr Donnelly said he believes increasing the number of people being tested for the virus, as well as establishing who has immunity, will play a crucial role in lting lockdown measures.He said officials should use antigen and antibody tests that have already been developed, despite concerns about their effectiveness.We don#t have the luxury of time to make sure they are perfect, he said.We have to use what is available to us now. However, he stressed it is vital that a vaccine is safe to use.If we are rolling this out to millions of people we don#t want to find out that it is harmful, he said.Despite this, he said he is optimistic that a vaccine can be found before the end of the year.Although he warned that it may have to be altered each year, similarly to the influenza vaccination.He continued: If we open everything up gradually, we can stop a second wave.I would like to think we will be through this by the first week in July and similarly I would like to think that people who are shielding will also be able to begin toto normal.The key to this is testing who has the virus and establishing who has had the virus and has some immunity, but it is important that we remove social distancing measures slowly.Officials are coming under increasing pressure to reveal their exit strategy once the predicted surge is over, amid claims the Cabinet is split over whether to risk more deaths to save the plunging economy.Speaking at the daily briefing in London on Sunday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson dismissed calls to spell out the exit strategy from coronavirus lockdown - despite claims ministers in England want schools to reopen after May .Mr Williamson told the daily Downing Street briefing he was sorry that children were having to suffer through the crisis but would not give a date for aof schools.Meanwhile, the Department of Education has not responded to a similar query over when schools here may reopen, or whether it has ruled out the possibility of pupils ing to classrooms before September.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said her work on the frontline in the battle against the virus left her and her family feeling asthey were regarded as “lepers”. While on concerns around PPE, she said it felt like she was “cannon fodder”.It comes after Public Health Englandchanged its guidance to recommend staff reuse PPE during shortages when it is safe to do so.The recommendation has not been implemented in Northern Ireland and the Royal College of Nursinghas written to Health Minister Robin Swann to seek clarity over the issue. RCN NI director Pat Cullen said that Mr Swann responded promptly but that his response did not go far enough.A Department of Health statement said health bodies would be consultedany decision was taken to change the guidance.This guidance on the reuse of PPE is not implemented in NI at this point. Andor when it might be required, the department will consider this, taking account of the national and scientic evidence and will provide further advice at the appropriate time, the statement read.Such consideration will be undertakenrequired, and only following full engagement and in consultation with professional bodies and trade union representative organisations.We#re as petried as everyone  in the general public, we have families too, we don#t want to be bringing this home to our families or, more importantly, giving this to other sick patients. Senior nurse Denise KellySenior nurse Denise Kelly spoke to BBC Radio Ulster#s Good Morning Ulster programme on Monday morning after she finished her night sht.She said that staff were absolutely terried by the Public Health England guidelines to reuse PPE, though confirmed that she hadn#t been asked to reuse PPE, nor had any of her colleagues.I don#t know what#s coming in the next couple of days, but I just hope we can get that surety from our ministers that we are not going to be put in that position, Mrs Kelly said.  At the end of the day I#m a human being, we#re as petried as everyone  in the general public, we have families too, we don#t want to be bringing this home to our families or, more importantly, giving this to other sick patients.We need to feel comfortable when we go into work, I can#t emphasize this enough, please don#t put us in this position. Mrs Kelly said her -year-old daughter Ciara had been called #coronavirus# because of her mum#s job as a nurse.We#re being viewed nearly as lepers, not just as frontline workers. Our children too, our families, it#s causing a lot of tensions, she said.There#s a fear of people distancing away from us or you work in the hospital, you#re with those patients, you may give something to us. That has massive social and psychological implications for us too.I don#t think people can underestimate the effect. We#re out there saving lives, we#re trying to do our best for the public and that perception is being a leper and to an extent, when we talk about PPE, cannon fodder. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_eabaa-db--a-afbdade_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"First Minister Arlene Foster  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFirst Minister Arlene Foster First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster that advising the reuse of PPE would not be introduced in Northern Ireland.Our nurses and our health care workers need to have that clarity, she said.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said the reuse of PPE would never be acceptable.She said that the Executive was constantly working to procure more PPE from a range of sources, including local businesses, the rest of the UK and China.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Some parents have had dficulty finding places for their children including senior health care workers in the city.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period.

Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed.

The next job was to find a team name.Thoughts turned to Brazil and Rivelino.His club was Corinthians of Sao Paulo. The name stuck and soon there would be Corinthians of the Downpatrick Youth League.ldquoWe had a couple of good seasons, nothing special, but around  Austin got a squad of very good footballers together, David recalls.Each Saturday morning Austin took his big Ford Corsair out to Saul and Raholp to collect some boys, including Pat lsquoSkipperrsquo McMullan, Sean McMullan, Lorny Murphy and Noel Denvir.These joined a group of players from Crossgar, such as Mel and Con McCarthy, Leo Casement, Dan McHugh, Gregory Bell, lsquoChippyrsquo Bell and lsquoBootsiersquo Madine.Though Austin had an excess of players and it was hard to give everyone a game, the Crossgar boys encouraged him to sign a number of Killyleagh lads and so Jute Sullivan, Kevin Nelson and Chris Hagan joined up. They were a very talented forward line and team.Corinthiansrsquo main rivals were Panathinaikos, managed by Pat McKinney.At the end of the season Austin won the leaguersquos Manager of the Year award, for which he was very proud.He went on to be involved with Downpatrick Rec and was club chairman when they won the Steel and Sons Cup.Many of the Corinthians players went on to play for local teams in the Amateur League and Newcastle League, and also played Gaelic football.Corinthians may no longer exist, but they are still fondly remembered by those who can recall the early days of the Downpatrick Youth League and were fired up by the wizards of Brazil..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Centre.jpg","title":"Centre set up as new community support hub  ","story":"A NEW community co-ordination hub to deliver essential supplies to vulnerable residents across the district has been set up at the Down Leisure Centre.The Market Street facility has been transformed into a new distribution centre to help meet the needs of people who have been confined to home as part of the governmentrsquos lockdown measures.And with restrictions on movement set to remain in place for the next few weeks, the new community hub will have an increasingly important role to play.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub.The Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff have been redeployed to work across all sites and alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff are working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

Last year he opened the Acoustic stage at the Glastonbury Festival.He also opened for Snow Patrol in the US, Europe and Asia and stood in as an honorary member of the band when guitarist Johnny McDaid was recovering after surgery.The son of Nuala and John McMullan, who still in Portaferry, Ryan started off performing at a young age, singing in a local band, Purple Road, when he was in his mid-teens.He is now staying at his Belfast home, having made it back from the US last month, just two days before the country closed off its airports.Many of his concerts have had to be postponed, including two nights at the Portico Theatre in Portaferry, now rescheduled to June -, and hisUK and Ireland tour this month.

Amusing himself by throwing me into situations where Irsquom either out of my depth, hoping for reconciliation, or unable to escape the truth that even at theend, Irsquom still holding on to even the worst of my attempts at love.ldquoIn A Heartbeat was written to sum up a stage I think we all kind of go through sooner or later: the understanding that something that once was, is now no more.But even at the end knowing it still has a hold on you, so much so, that no matter how toxic it is, or how little sense it made, yoursquod still run back to it in a desperate attempt to salvage it.The new single is already going down well with fans as the video has been viewed over , times online.Ryan added: ldquoEverything has been going great for me so far, even without my debut album coming out and that. I donrsquot think that all these tracks will be on my new album when I feel that itrsquos ready to be released.

This has enabled us to expand the nursing and midwery workforce by reaching out to those who have retired or lapsed their registration over the past number of years and provided opportunities for early registration for overseas staff.ldquoI am exceptionally grateful for the excellent response demonstrated by those who have volunteered toto practice and support the professional response to this pandemic.ldquoEach and every new registrant on the emergency register is a very welcome addition to the professional team and the support you will provide will have a signicant impact on outcomes for patients and the multidisciplinary workforce.Mrs McArdle said she wanted to specically thank nursing and midwery students for their ldquovaluable contribution to the delivery of safe, person-centred care as members of the nursing and midwery team.ldquoI recognise that this is an uncertain time causing great anxiety for many of you and your families.

I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach.

O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor.

It happened in July  when the electorate installed a Labour government with a massive majority, even though there was national gratitude for Churchill’s leadership. It happened in May  when the electorate took a risk with Margaret Thatcherbecause they were sick of socialism, strikes, trade union power over successive governments and inflation.At both those moments there was a very evident sense of the desire for change a new way of doing political business,you like. I think we will see that again, when the electorate is finally given the chance to pass judgment on the present government and its handlingof the crisis. An unexpectedly large body-countcould swing a substantial number of votes, particularlythere is a belief that government inaction was responsible for the deaths. But there will be other considerations.Sir Keir Starmers election as Labour leader is likely to make Boris Johnson’s le post-crisis more dficult :  Getty Images \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Soaring unemploymenttax increases and cuts in public spendinga possible continuing and y lockdown for some sections of the population continuing fears – in the absence of certainty about vaccines and immunity – about second or thirdsurges of the virus and some ongoing aspects of the restrictions associated with the present lockdown: all of these factors, along with many others, will determine Boris Johnson’s future and post-crisis legacy.In my case, I think I will be ok for the time being. That’s because I have observed the lockdown recommendations and Kerri has been very careful when she has had to go to the supermarket. We are also very fortunate in having a garden and lots of space in itto keep us occupied, meaning that exercise and fresh air is not an issue for us. At the beginning of March I was very worried and believed I would be lucky to survive.But I still worry about what happens when the lockdown eases and shops begin to reopen  If the ‘surge’ has been contained but the virus is still with us, how do I know I won’t come into contact with it a few weeks later  What happensthere are predictions of another surge towards the end of the year a time of long nights, short days and much colder weather  Will we see lockdown reimposed  Will businesses be closed again  What happenswe still don’t have a vaccine  What happensthe usual seasonal flucoincides with an upturn in CV- casualties Economic recovery needs to be fuelled by a feeling of certainty yet we may not have those certainties anytime soon. Try getting a loan on the basis that nobody really has a clue what is likely to happen a few months down the road. Try bringing down unemployment levels when there is very little certainty or optimism among the key lenders. Try rebuilding a country when people believe there is a smudge of virus in every nook, cranny, surface and human contact.So, the government won’t merely be judged by what it did between January and the end of the first surge. There could yet be enormous anger at the scale of death, yet the brutal fact remains that the anger will be lessenedthe next phase of the crisisis handled well. At this point we have no hard evidence on any of those crucial issues.Another factor can be described as the post-Corbyn impact. Johnson was blessed in having Corbyn as his chief electoral opponent, in the same way that Thatcher was blessed with Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock. But Sir Keir Starmer could be a dferent kettle of fish and a much greater problem for Johnson . That said, Starmer has to be careful about how he tackles the prime minister during a national crisis.This crisis won’t disappear anytime soon. In most crises what passes for a ‘normal’ le for the vast majority of people will continue. They will continue to go to work and the economy will continue to , evenit takes a hit. Lockdownis the key dference this time. And, so far, there are no guarantees – not even close to it, in fact – that when lockdown ends we simply reboot, reset andto where we left off. That’s why this crisis is so dferent so devastating.All of which means that there will, almost certainly, be huge political societal changes as we find a way through and beyond the crisis. Some old norms will , but there will also be new norms emerging, too.I also suspect that many of us will have found out things about ourselves and our resilience over the past few months, as well as gaining a new understanding of our relationships and interdependence. And, to be honest, that will be no bad thing. Indeed, it may be most important and lasting consequence of the crisis.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But it canrsquot be based on a lie.The letter to the newspaper editors is the latest chapter in a fractious relationship between the couple and sections of the media which began in the early period of their relationship.Harry lashed out at the ldquowave of abuse and harassment his then girlfriend had faced from the media in November , and by autumn last year their dealings descended to new lows.Meghanrsquos legal action against Associated Newspapers was announced last October in a highly personal statement in which Harry accused some newspapers of a ldquoruthless campaign against his we.Referring to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was a tabloid newspaper staple and died in a car crash in Paris while being pursued by the paparazzi, Harry said: ldquoThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one.He added: ldquoI lost my mother and now I watch my we falling victim to the same powerful forces.In the run-up to Harry and Meghanrsquos wedding, Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy after allegedly staging paparazzi photographs of himself, and he later dropped out of the ceremony saying, according to reports, that he did not want to ldquoembarrass the royal family or his daughter.The court documents reveal that Harry texted Mr Markle, , on May   after he did not answer calls, and wrote: ldquoU do not need to apologize , we understand the circumstances but lsquogoing publicrsquo will only make the situation worse.The message went on to say: ldquoOh any speaking to the press WILL backfire, trust me Tom. Only we can help u, as we have been trying from day .Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, which has members from the national and regional press, television and radio, said: ldquoAlthough the duke and duchess say they support a free press and all it stands for, there is no escaping their actions here amount to censorship and they are setting an unfortunate example.ldquoAlthough the couple may no longer style themselves as working royals, they continue to be high-profile public figures and indeed have made plain their intention to continue to do so.ldquoBy appearing to dictate which media they will work with and which they will ignore they, no doubt unintentionally, give succour to the rich and powerful everywhere to use their example as an excuse to attack the media when it suits them.The SoE has expressed regret over the announcement by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they will boycott several UK newspapers. https:t.co gxiYIkCpM pic OOtSBkmdash Society of Editors UKApril , Harry and Meghan are now based in Los Angeles with baby son Archie, having formally stepped down as working members of the royal family on March .It is understood the duke and duchess did not want to take this step with the newspapers at a time when they want to focus their attention on supporting efforts to alleviate the coronavirus pandemic.The duke and duchess have been pictured making food deliveries in America after it emerged that they spent the Easter break dropping off meals to vulnerable and housebound people in Los Angeles.But in a podcast interview released at the weekend, Harry claimed the coronavirus outbreak was ldquobetter than the reports from certain sections of the media.He said: ldquoItrsquos also proving that, I think, things are better than wersquore led to believe through certain corners of the media.ldquoIt can be very worrying when yoursquore sitting there and the only information you are getting is from certain news channels, but thenyou are out and about or you are on the right s, you can really sense this human spirit coming to the forefront..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Harry and Meghan end co-operation with British tabloid press article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Every council needs to cut out waste and prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes on their residents.”The Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, John O’Connell said: “The coronavirus crisis means that frontline council services are more crucial than ever, but at the same time household budgets face an enormous squeeze.“There are plenty of talented people in local authorities who are focused on delivering more for less, but that is needed across the board.“The country needs every council to cut out waste and prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes on their residents.“These figures should shine a light on the town hall bosses who’ve got it right, but also allow taxpayers to hold to account those who aren’t delivering value for money at this critical time.”The TaxPayers’ Alliance’s Town Hall Rich List  can be found athttps:www.taxpayersalliance town_hall_rich_list_A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
