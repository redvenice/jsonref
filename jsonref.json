He uses the quiet time to get some study done before starting on a two-hour and 40-minute journey by bus to college. Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland. He now lives with his wife – who is not permitted to work under her visa – and one of his children in Rathangan, Co Kildare, while the other child stays in Kenya.Wafula gets a monthly €1,500 scholarship stipend. He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord and just like that golfgate is brought to a swift and sudden end","story":"Is that it?Eighteen months of “Golfgate” madness dismissed in four minutes by a no-nonsense judge in a Galway courtroom.Donie Cassidy, Noel Grealish and hoteliers John and James Sweeney must have been as surprised as everyone else at the speed with which the verdict was produced. As day three of holding forth in never-ending circles around the banqueting tables of a golf society dinner drew to a close, most observers expected proceedings to spill over into another day.Senator Michael McDowell SC had just completed an excruciatingly long closing argument (at one point we noted two people asleep in his vicinity) explaining why his client, TD Noel Grealish, had absolutely no case to answer.There were three other senior counsel ready and waiting to do the same.And then suddenly, after months and months of fury and fulmination and acres of newsprint and countless hours of angry back-and-forth across the airwaves, Judge Mary Fahy dismissed the case against Grealish in a few pithy sentences.“Absolutely no evidence to show he was one of the organisers” of the infamous Golfgate dinner in Connemara. “This is a criminal prosecution. I have a reasonable doubt.”It’s a pity judges don’t bang gavels in Irish courts because this would have been the perfect time for some legal percussion. Perhaps they’ll have a gavel in the movie.“So I have to dismiss the charges.”But she wasn’t finished yet.There would be no impassioned closing addresses from Colm Smyth, Eddie Walsh and Constance Cassidy, and all three of them imported at considerable expense from the Inner Bar in Dublin. There would be no grand stand to make on behalf of their clients, because Mary Fahy was in no mood to hang around. She had heard enough.“We have to admit – anyone listening to the case – that the evidence was most impressive,” she declared, singling out witnesses John Flaherty, former captain of the guard in Leinster House, and none other than Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe as being particularly impressive.“Responsible people” who wouldn’t have gone to a dinner if they didn’t feel comfortable or safe.Judge Fahy had no doubt that the defendants did everything they thought they could do to comply with the Covid restrictions.“And in my view they did comply – not in the court of public opinion but in the court of law, in my view, they did.”This was only going one way.“So I am dismissing the charges against all the defendants.”There were no cheers. No high-fiving.Misty-eyedNoel Grealish, who was captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society, was the first politician to emerge. He looked a little flushed and misty-eyed as he stood beside his solicitor and let him do the talking. His lawyer and Oireachtas colleague McDowell, who had just triumphantly talked the case to a conclusion, was beaming.Donie Cassidy (75), who had taken the whole episode very badly, was last to leave the courthouse, flanked by the members of the Westmeath legal massive who handled his case: his senior counsel Colm Smyth, junior counsel and former Labour TD Willie Penrose and solicitor JJ Mannion.In some ways, and after hearing three days of evidence, there was a certain inevitability to this whole sorry saga ending with an emotional Donie standing on the courthouse steps in the drizzle, quoting the words of his late, beloved mother: “The truth always wins in the end.”You knew he was upset because he forgot to thank the Minister for Justice for the use of the hall.A weight was gone off his shoulders and he was mightily relieved, but the strain was etched on his face as he remembered all the people who were lost to Covid and the “friends who lost their position in life” as a result of the controversy.Should he have held the dinner at all? “In hindsight, everyone would do something maybe differently.”A few hours earlier, he was in bits with worry.“What do you think? I don’t know what to think. The last two years, oh, I couldn’t begin to tell ya. There was no talking to them. No talking to them . . . How do you think it will go?”Donie the defendant, disconsolate at lunchtime and thinking he was facing into a fourth day in court. For somebody who had been living with the aftermath of the “Golfgate” furore for 18 months, he still seemed shocked by it all.ConsideredAfter the charges were dismissed, questions were asked about whether he should have organised the dinner. The Westmeath legal massive was having none of it as former Senator Cassidy considered his reply.“The court has ruled,” they muttered behind him. “The court has ruled.” And then they gently nudged their client towards the car.All the talk, all the legal argument forgotten in the shock delivery of the verdicts.Eoghan Cole BL, who argued the case for the DPP and the State, looked disconsolate as he left the building. He had put forward a spirited fight against a star team of legal big guns (and a Supreme Court judge who attended the golf beano giving the benefit of his wisdom on the matter from the witness box). And superb he was too, noted the judge on Thursday.Inspector Peter Conlon – he was the main Garda witness – was given a torrid time in the witness box. He stuck to his view that sticking a temporary partition wall down a room of over 80 people to ide them into two legally acceptable groups did not mean they were attending separate events, or in different rooms.“It’s my assertion that it is one room by virtue of two openings made in the partition,” he said in reply to Eddie Walsh’s cultured bellowing.There were discussions on what constitutes a multiple gathering and what is the definition of an organiser. Does a moveable partition make a moveable feast? How big a gap in the partition is acceptable? Is there a difference between mingling and intermingling? Why did nearly all the witnesses seem to be seated with their backs to the action?What exactly is a “three-shot fourball single stableford Champagne scramble competition”? Inspector Conlon was able to explain that to the court. Guards like playing golf. Barristers like boasting that they know nothing about it, as they did again on Thursday.MeanderingFor all his meandering, McDowell made some excellent points in his closing argument. Not least on the intriguing question of “someone in Dublin”, maybe in the DPP’s office, keen to prosecute some of the main movers in the golf outing because of the public outcry over it?“Doubtless somebody somewhere in Dublin decided that there was a public interest in showing the public that heads would roll . . . Doubtless somebody did that in order to assuage public opinion and anger.”This anger was compounded by people “thinking that 80 people had assembled in secret, more or less, abusing their status as members of the Oireachtas” in contravention of the rules. “That was the source of all that anger and recrimination and all the disastrous consequences that followed.”He reminded the court of the atmosphere at the time.The country nearly melted down with anger, quivered McDowell.It didn’t sound like a great night anyway. Former minister Dara Calleary, who had to resign over his attendance at the function, told how he was escorted to a table and told to stay there unless he needed to go to the toilet.After the decision, some of the victorious lawyers gathered in the opulent bar of the Hardiman Hotel on Eyre Square to have a celebratory drink, watch the six o’clock news and toast the partition.Is this the end of Golfgate?The ranks of The Vindicated may now be seeking reinstatement. RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke has already expressed a desire “to be back on air”. Big Phil Hogan will be like a Cheshire Cat. And Dara Calleary will be eyeing a ministerial return when the next reshuffle happens.As for everyone else, you’ll have to ask all the people who cancelled weddings and other events at the time. If they had known they could have had all their guests in attendance if only they had thought of getting partitions. They won’t be too happy, even if they did the right thing.Judge Fahy may have closed her case, but the court of public opinion is still in session."},{"url":null,"title":"austria passes covid vaccine mandate but question marks linger over enforcement","story":"Austria becomes the first European Union country to make Covid-19 vaccination legally compulsory for adults. Photograph:  Joe KlamarAFP via Getty ImagesAustria has become the first country in the EU to make vaccinations against Covid-19 mandatory for all adults, but questions remain over whether it can sway those sceptical of taking the jab and how much the Alpine state’s government is willing to press those who won’t comply.The upper house of the Austrian parliament, the Bundesrat, on Thursday evening voted 47-12 in favour of a general vaccination mandate, formally approvinga law that will see those over the age of 18 who decline to take a jab face penalties of up to €3,600, unless they are pregnant or severely ill.The legislation, which was signed by Austria’s president Alexander Van der Bellen on Friday and will come into effect over the coming days, has been followed with great interest across Europe, where other nations have considered taking a similar step. Already approved by the lower house of Austria’s parliament with a clear majority last month, Austria’s vaccine mandate is due to come into effect in three stages.Every household is to be informed of the new law via post by March 15th, after which police will start monitoring people’s immunisation status via spot checks and issuing fines of €600, rising to up to €3,600 in case of noncompliance.In the third phase, those who cannot show proof of vaccination by a certain deadline are to be automatically fined, but it is unclear whether the government still keen to enforce its mandate to such a degree.In an interview with public broadcaster ORF on Thursday morning, health minister Wolfgang Mückstein was unable to give a date for the crucial deadline.As Austria has inched closer to a decision on mandatory vaccinations, the conservative-Greens coalition government of chancellor Karl Nehammer has simultaneously loosened restrictions for the unvaccinated.A “lockdown for the unvaccinated” was lifted on Monday, and shops, restaurants and hotels across most of the country will soon be able to receive visitors who haven’t got a jab, as long as they can show a recent negative test result.Political developments around the mandate have been followed closely in Germany, where government calls for a similar law have become more cautious in recent weeks.“Since the government announced the compulsory measure in mid-January, it has done everything to undermine, soften and make its own project redundant,” wrote Munich-based German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung in a comment piece. “The message is clear: we didn’t really mean it.”Gerald Loacker, a health spokesperson for liberal NEOS opposition party, said waning political enthusiasm for mandatory vaccinations was impossible to ignore.“What we are dealing with here is a vaccine mandate that comes into effect just as the government is making it possible for those who aren’t vaccinated to enter a bar with a subsidised free test result and raise a glass to their resistance,” Loacker said.“That’s not a coherent policy, and people in Austria are taking note of that.”Karl Stöger, a professor of constitutional law at Vienna university, said that seeming incoherence was partly a deliberate choice. “The vaccination mandate has legal teeth, but it is also a law that is very aware of the limits of what a state can force people to do,” he said.Stöger, who has advised the government in its handling of the pandemic, said it was possible that Austria’s constitutional court could still stymie the vaccine mandate, especially if an “endemic” situation of the virus with low hospitalisation rates no longer makes vaccinations appear vital.Like many other European countries, Austria is experiencing record rates of Covid-19 infections, but the number of patients in intensive care beds with the virus is declining.With 68.8 per cent of its population having received at least two shots of a vaccine, however, the government argues that only mandatory vaccinations will bring immunisation rates to a sufficiently high level to weather another wave of the virus later this year.Last December’s emphatic endorsement of the vaccine mandate idea on behalf of the government, then still fronted by interim chancellor Alexander Schallenberg, has also made it politically difficult for the conservative Austrian People’s party to change its mind without losing face.“There’s a sense the whole of Europe is watching us: a government U-turn at this stage would amount to a huge loss of face,” said Clemens Schuhmann, a journalist for Oberösterreichische Nachrichten newspaper.Yet enforcing the mandate could come with the risk of further stoking isions in a society already polarised over the course of the pandemic.Upper Austria, the northern state that Schuhmann reports on, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with fewer than 60 per cent of residents fully vaccinated in some municipalities bordering on southern Germany.“Those who will get vaccinated because of the mandate are the ones who can’t afford to pay the fines”, he said. “The risk is that others will get further radicalised and rather go to prison than take the jab.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and

Among the 425 or so bodies, there were 40 that had been decapitated post mortem and buried with their heads at their pelvis or their feet.While traditional theories suggest that such treatment was doled out only to criminals and outcasts, that was not the case at Fleet Marston, said Carl Champness, the project manager at Oxford Archaeology, one of a group of specialist companies working for HS2.“We don’t think it’s to do with criminals or outcasts because they are buried amongst the others, not always towards the edges or outskirts of the cemetery, and the same sort of care is given to their burial as everyone else,” Mr Champness told The .There was also an equal balance between male and female remains being treated in that manner, while in one case a young woman who appeared to have died in childbirth was decapitated and buried with her child.That particular interment may offer a hint as to what was taking place, according to Mr Champness.“Maybe the sudden death of a young person or an inidual for whatever reason, the unexpected nature of the death… that may be the reason we are seeing these decapitated iniduals,” he said.The appearance of such bodies in Roman burial sites in Britain is not unusual, Mr Champness explained, saying that a percentage of remains were often in such a state, suggesting that the cult was widespread at the time.Exactly what the beliefs behind the burial right were, however, remain a mystery.The cemeteries found at Fleet Marston are of ordinary people, rather than high-status iniduals, which adds to the intrigue, said Mr Champness.Unlike a villa mausoleum, these grounds contained “the everyday people who would have farmed the fields, manned the shops, the market stalls these are the people who actually were living in this area”.The archaeological dig is on the outskirts of a Roman trading town, which was about a days’ march from Verulamium near St Albans, and Alchester near Bicester.The wide clearings at the side of the road suggest that market stalls and gambling dens would have been set up there to cater for travellers and soldiers passing through.Signs of this commercial purpose include gaming dice, lead weights and more than 1,000 coins found during the excavations.More from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS backlog will worsen before it gets better, warns Health Secretary as recovery plan is delayedThe Complacent Generation of Western leaders has left us weak.

Even as they cut defence spending, they stuck two fingers up to the United States, the ally upon whom European security depends. The European Union, which contributed to peace by integrating the economies of Western Europe, came to believe it had secured peace beyond France and Germany. It expanded its borders toward Russia, even opening talks with Ukraine, but lacks the hard power to defend its members and friends. Observing Russian aggression, Finland, an EU member state, now urgently seeks fast-tracked NATO membership and American protection.Everywhere we look the foolishness and naivety of the Complacent Generation is beginning to reveal itself. The examples are many, but the energy crisis especially is a case study in stupidity.The crisis may be international, but responsibility for Britain’s lack of preparedness lies at home. Energy prices have been rising here for years, thanks to ministers loading green surcharges onto household and industrial energy costs. Now, with rising Chinese demand for gas, Russia exploiting Europe’s dependence on its gas supplies, the post-pandemic resumption of the global economy, and Britain’s depleted gas storage capacity and refusal to exploit its own reserves, wholesale gas costs have more than quadrupled since before the pandemic. British households, and our energy-intensive industries, will pay the price, just as they will pay for rising inflation and, however necessary they might eventually be, tax rises. The whole structure of our economy – too reliant on financial services, too geographically unequal, too exposed to stretched supply chains, poorly connected, with low productivity and too little investment – is as it is because of the decisions and indecision of the Complacent Generation. No politician of any party has yet provided the coherent plan for growth we need.Neither is there a credible plan to project and defend Western interests as economic, diplomatic and military power shift eastward. Geopolitical change has been hastened by Western errors, like Middle Eastern wars, naivety, such as through world trade policies, and the virus, which disrupted democratic societies more than autocratic states. But Britain and our allies have also been blind – perhaps wilfully so – to the actions of our competitors and enemies.China has bought its way into our critical national infrastructure, our universities and even, as we learned recently, our democratic institutions. It has corrupted international institutions, from the World Health Organisation to Interpol. It has created rival organisations – such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank – with the connivance of the British government. It has stolen industrial secrets and increased its economic and military reach around Asia and Africa.More from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS backlog will worsen before it gets better, warns Health Secretary as recovery plan is delayedOttawa declares state of emergency as Covid protests get \u0026#39out of control\u0026#39Politicians who criticised AstraZeneca vaccine \u0026#39probably killed hundreds of thousands\u0026#39, says Oxford scientistSir Keir Starmer cleared by police over lockdown office beerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rolls royce unveils smaller figurine aerodynamic pose bonnets","story":"The Spirit of Ecstasy, the figurine that has sat on Rolls-Royce bonnets for the past 111 years, has shrunk.The car maker has unveiled a “reimagined” Spirit of Ecstasy for the electrical age. At 82.73mm tall, the new figure will be rolled out on Rolls-Royce’s first all electric car - the Spectre - when it goes on sale at the end of 2023. The streamlined Spirit has been slimmed down and remodelled to reduce drag, making the new car just that bit more aerodynamic.According to Rolls-Royce, the new figure is 17.28mm shorter than her predecessor (which measured 100.01mm).”Her robes, which flow behind her in the slipstream,” said the motoring company, “have been subtly reshaped to make them more aerodynamic and realistic.”But, said Rolls-Royce, “the most visible change is her stance”. The Spirit of Ecstasy had “previously stood with her feet together, legs straight and tilting at the waist.“Now, she is a true goddess of speed, braced for the wind, one leg forward, body tucked low, her eyes focused eagerly ahead”.After 830 hours of design modelling and wind tunnel testing, Rolls-Royce, based at Goodwood in West Sussex, but now a subsidiary of BMW, is delighted with the result. Not everybody else is quite so keen. The ’s motoring correspondent Jeremy Taylor concluded: “We think it’s, well, likely to be isive, looking as though it’s been attacked with a flamethrower.“Close inspection reveals that instead of leaning forward from the waist as previously, the woman is now crouched on bended knee. A subtle change that some might say amounts to diddly squat, literally.”Many  readers appeared to agree with him. “Unbelievable on so many levels. Aerodynamic drag on a 3 sculpture? Changing a well respected, traditional, lovely mascot? Ludicrous waste of time,” posted Phil Carmichael.Steve Webb wrote: “Unfortunately the picture I first saw made it look like a lady about to undergo a Gynaecology examination! Dear RR please leave well alone.”Rolls-Royce Motor Cars said the only mutterings of discontent had been emanating from the ’s correspondent. Out of hundreds of articles written about the design change, this was the only negative one.This is not the first time the Spirit of Ecstasy has enjoyed a revamp. In the car maker’s 111 -year history, the mascot has been altered subtly or otherwise around 12 times. This is the smallest version yet and while it reduces aerodynamic drag, it also helps when it has to shrink back into the bonnet on collision. The smaller, presumably the easier, the Spirit of Ecstasy is to retract.A Rolls-Royce spokesman said it had made the Spirit retractable in case of collisions. Legislation in certain countries - largely in the European Union - has ruled the figurine a danger to pedestrians. Not that that had ever been an issue, the spokesman said.  It also prevents the figure being stolen by passing thieves.The original Spirit of Ecstasy was designed by Charles Sykes – an artist and sculptor. Originally called The Whisper, the first Spirit of Ecstasy was based on a bronze sculpture Sykes had previously created for Lord Montagu of Beaulieu’s car and which in turn was based on Eleanor Thornton, the aristocrat’s lover.   More from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS backlog will worsen before it gets better, warns Health Secretary as recovery plan is delayedThe Complacent Generation of Western leaders has left us weak.

Television’s new remake, however, will have a more modern sensibility.Harry Palmer will meet his match in Jean Courtney, a minor character in the film and Len Deighton’s original novel, but now “professionally expanded” and promoted to secret agent.The ITV adaptation, which begins next month, stars Joe Cole in the role originally played by Michael Caine.Jean is played by Lucy Boynton, who said she was delighted that the drama has invented such a strong female role.In Deighton’s 1962 novel “you get a suggestion of who she is and she’s incredibly intriguing in the book, but it’s much more limited. Whereas in the series she is such a presence.“She is not only personally expanded - we see the experience of a young woman in that era - but also professionally expanded,” said Boynton.“So in the books she was Harry’s assistant, whereas in our series she is an agent in her own right and really good at what she does.“There’s just a tremendous amount to unpack and, especially as a woman who is balancing all the societal expectations pressed upon women at that time versus this double life as an agent, I think you get the best of both worlds.“She’s such an interesting commentary on what it’s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry, especially within the context of this era of so-called liberation for women and young people.”The adaptation also features an African-American character, CIA agent Paul Maddox, played by Ashley Thomas.“He is a powerful African-American person at that time, which sometimes hasn’t been shown in that period, so it was exciting for me to play that and make sure I approached the character with respect and care.“I wanted to make sure I did the part justice and understand the culture of the time,” said Thomas, who said he read Leutrell Osborne’s memoir, Black Man In The CIA, as research.James Watkins, the show’s director, said he was keen to adapt Deighton because “great characters and stories are timeless”.Watkins said: “It’s a great spy story that also has a real sense of social mobility - whether it’s Harry Palmer in the class war he’s fighting, or Ashley’s character fighting the racism of the time, or the glass ceiling for women that Jean is facing.Cole said he had tried to avoid watching Michael Caine’s Harry Palmer because he did not want to be influenced by that performance.“I watched one of the films but then I quickly realised I wanted to put my own spin on it. I was worried that I was going to start trying to do a Michael Caine impersonation without realising I was doing it, because he is so iconic.“So I quickly tried to erase that from my memory,” said Cole.The actor said he had spent some time selecting the right pair of glasses for the role. “I went to the opticians and tried on every pair in the shop, and one pair worked better than any of the others,” he said.“A haircut and a costume, in this case, glasses really sets you on your way to becoming a character.”Deighton’s son, Alex, acted as a consultant on the series. Deighton himself, now aged 92, did not work on the show but its screenwriter, John Hodge said: “I would love to meet him. I would take him my 30-year-old copy of The Ipcress File and get him to sign it.“I hope that he enjoys the show - it’s partly a tribute to his books.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS backlog will worsen before it gets better, warns Health Secretary as recovery plan is delayedThe Complacent Generation of Western leaders has left us weak.

Now a multi-billion pound plan to tackle the NHS backlog has been delayed after the Treasury blocked an announcement due to be made today. The National Recovery Plan for the health service had been the subject of detailed discussions over the past week involving No 10, the Treasury, the Department of Health and NHS. Health officials were expecting it to be announced by Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, as evidence of their determination to tackle the problem. But it has emerged that the Treasury refused to sign off the plans, with sources citing concerns over value for money after deadlines for hitting treatment targets slipped as a result of the omicron surge. Charles Hymas writes that it comes amid reports of growing tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson hopes that changes to his top team will ease the concerns of backbenchers wavering about his future.The number of MPs to have publicly revealed that they have submitted a letter of no confidence in his leadership or called for him to stand down has reached 15. After five of the PM\u0027s aides resigned in the wake of partygate, several new appointments were made - including Steve Barclay as chief of staff in No 10, which sparked a backlash from Tories and Whitehall insiders. It came as Carrie Johnson blamed bitter ex-officials for claims she has too much influence on government policy. A biography claims she used her husband\u0027s phone to direct his staff during his leadership campaign.Energy ratings for homes are to be overhauled by the Government, amid fears that under the current system installing a heat pump could cut the value of properties. Energy Performance Certificates grade a house from A to G based on efficiency and the rating is increasingly linked to property prices. Landlords are required to hit a minimum rating under forthcoming rules and some mortgage providers take the certificates into account when lending. But, as Tom Rees reports, the way the ratings are currently estimated means that replacing a traditional gas boiler with a heat pump can lower a home\u0027s energy efficiency rating.The question of whether the Duchess of Cornwall would one day be called Queen has been haunting the hallways of Clarence House for nearly two decades.

It is utterly misguided.Mr Putin’s claim that Russia and Ukraine are an inisible part of ancient Rus is fantasy. Ukraine is an independent nation, the security of which several nations, including the UK and Russia, vowed to respect in a 1994 treaty.

Now, more and more people are turning to itMembers of the Sheppey Support Bus Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsIn the snaking queue for the Sheppey Support Bus people raise their hoods against the wind screaming off the Thames Estuary. Harsh winter sun throws tired under-eye shadows into sharp relief. These folk in Minster-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, are here to ask for help and that’s hard to stomach for many, embarrassing.Chantelle Stroud, , is out of electricity today. The stay-at-home mum of two under-fives and a teenager thankfully has £ on her gas meter due to a cold weather payment, administered when temperatures drop below  degrees.But without electricity, cooking is an issue. She’ll go to her mum’s. Her “big, old house”, a private rental, is “impossible to keep warm” anyway when you eke out gas. “I go to bed at six with the kids to keep warm,” she admits. “We have been ill for weeks and weeks, my eldest since before Christmas, the doctor says she has a problem with her lung. Her bedroom is freezing.” The innovative double decker bus, brainchild of Sheppey Community Development Forum, was launched in November to offer food support - a social supermarket on the lower deck - and fuel poverty support - offices on the upper deck - to the people of this deprived area. Up top sits Stevie Pettitt, a fuel and water adviser for Seashells, a local family charity, whose job is to arrange emergency fuel vouchers, supplied by Fuel Bank Foundation, to people unable to top up their gas and electricity prepayment meters. With an energy price cap rise of % in April announced by Ofgem this week, this is the frontline of Britain’s fuel poverty war.Here, Stevie stares desperation full in the face while multi-millionaire chancellor Rishi Sunak just tells us higher energy prices “are something we will have to adjust to.”He’ll have no idea what that truly means. The people here know full well about ‘adjusting’ following energy hikes last autumn - they are already skipping showers, turning off the gas so they can cook their children’s tea on electric cookers, going to bed early. And yet most say they still have either run out of electricity or gas, or have only a pound or two left. Stevie says: “I feel I am putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. It is heartbreaking, you can hear the devastation in their voices saying ‘I’m cold’.  “People will ask for food they don’t need to cook, they wear dressing gowns over their clothes, they make tea in flasks so they don’t use the kettle. “It’s got to the point where this is all I’m doing and nothing .” A commonplace message pings on her phone. It reads: “I’m so sorry to ask, but how many fuel vouchers are people entitled to  I’m really struggling with topping up my gas, we have been wanting to keep the three kiddies warm. I have been advised it will be switched off at am today. Could you help me please ” The limit is theoretically three a year - but Fuel Bank Foundation can’t be strict. Stevie will rush, but can only get her a voucher by tomorrow.  Ofgem’s announcement for most households means an annual bill increase of £ to £, a year. For those using prepayment meters, many in private rentals and social housing, that rise will be £ to £, on average. Sunak has offered a £ loan to families via energy companies, but this will need to be paid back over time. Also £ council tax rebates to those in bands A-D, but the Resolution Foundation has said one in  of the poorest th of families do not live in properties of these bands. This is also not due until October, when experts predict further energy cost rises.  It’s hard to comprehend what this will mean for folk on the bus, of whom all I meet rely on benefits and do not work, either due to ill-health, caring responsibilities, or struggle to find employment. The vouchers are worth £, originally designed to last ten days on average, but now barely scrape a week for many. From mid-November Stevie’s given out .

Fuel Bank Foundation has  centres across Britain handing out around  vouchers a day compared to - a year ago. Deborah Clay, , from Sheerness-on-Sea, the bus’s next stop, has been without gas since Christmas Eve. A former baker and confectioner battling bad health and living alone, she racked up energy debts so agreed to switch to a prepayment meter, paying off that debt incrementally from each top up. But on Christmas Eve when she put on £ for gas, there was a fault and it didn’t register. She had no more to add. Struggling to get hold of her energy supplier, out of minutes on her phone, she battled on with only electricity and then developed pneumonia. She’s been scared to put more money on and lose it.  Raspy with a chest infection, she begs for Stevie’s help. Her voucher will clear her debt and standing charge, which has been mounting even though she hasn’t been using gas. And the energy company, finally reached, knocks off the lost £. Today is a good day, but it’s firefighting. She calculates energy costs her around £ a fortnight, even scrimping, and without her debt.“I borrowed an electric one-bar fire and have slept on the settee,” she admits. “I’ve boiled the kettle to wash up, I shower maybe once a week, it sounds skanky. For cooking I’ve used the microwave and one ring on the cooker.” William and Susan Bunce resort to sitting in the dark. Susan, , cares for William, , who has had a mini stroke, angina, and recently suffered pleurisy twice. He feels the cold painfully. Diligent Susan puts £ on electricity and £ on gas each fortnight. It won’t reach the end of that time. An extra tenner from her carer’s allowance will usually be needed to carry them through. The heating comes on for half an hour in the morning and one hour at night in the living room only - “and some days not at all.”“We don’t sit with the lights on now,” she says. “There is street light outside.“We used to shower every day, now it’s twice a week. It does get me down sometimes.” The visitor that leaves us silent, is a mum in her twenties who asks not to be named because she fears judgement.She regularly chooses electricity over gas so she can feed her two children.Today she has around £ left on gas, £ on electricity. She is searching for work, her Universal Credit is not due until later this month.“I borrow from friends, it’s a constant loop of asking,” she says, eyes glassy with tears she won’t let fall. “I go for electric so we can eat, I have been without gas for a week. “As soon as the kids come home from school they put their dressing gowns on and sit with duvets. If it’s sunny I keep them outside running around, it’s warmer.”  Stevie is despairing. A voucher only gives “breathing space”. Matthew Cole, head of Fuel Bank Foundation, says Sunak’s measures “don’t go far enough for those who need them the most”, and wants additional targeted support. Before a pm deadline Stevie must rush to process the vouchers, responsibility weighing heavy. “The problems feel so huge, I can’t think of anything ,” she says.

Department for Work and Pensionschiefs wrote to thousands of Work Coaches last week offering them an “opportunity to apply for a permanent role”.The number of Work Coaches doubled from , to , during the Covid pandemic as Universal Credit claims surged. But many are on fixed-term contracts, and senior officials admit some face being let go when those deals end in June. An e-mail seen by the Mirror told staff: “We hope you will decide to continue your career with DWP and apply for this opportunity.” So many are hit that virtual sessions - which have a limit of , participants - were split into alphabetical groups by surname.  One work coach - whose role involves sitting in Jobcentres across Britain helping claimants into jobs - said they felt “let down” and “blindsided”. They told the Mirror: “Some managers have suggested those affected should feel aposluckyapos to have this opportunity. “They have said they will try and keep aposthe majorityapos but nothing more specic than that.” The job fears mainly affect ‘EO’ grade Work Coaches. Union chiefs said in December that “nearly all” the , ‘AO’ grade coaches would stay. DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield suggested last year that the total of , work coaches could fall by thousands, to “well above ,. He said the number would “fall away” because fewer people were in the most intensive work search groups on Universal Credit.  Yet it comes days after Tory ministers announced a ‘Way to Work’ target, to move , Universal Credit claimants into work by June. Claimants will be forced to take jobs that aren’t in their specialist area four weeks after making a claim, or have their benefits stopped. The DWP confirmed , fixed-term work coaches have been told to reapplythey want permanent jobs.  Final decisions are expected in mid-March. A DWP spokesperson said: “We recognise the important contribution our staff on fixed-term contracts have made over the pandemic period and expect to be able to offer permanent roles to the majority of those, as we continue to deliver our multi-billion pound Plan for Jobs.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON JobcentresConservative PartyDepartment for Work and PensionsPublic servicesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It added: “Laboratory animals are currently not protected by the Act and are therefore victims of aposunnecessary sufferingapos.”Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter National Anti-Vivisection Society vice-president Tim Phillips said that “putting animal experimentation outside the law has stripped laboratory animals of protection”. He told the Mirror: “Animal researchers are permitted to do things to animals that would otherwise see the person responsible prosecuted for cruelty.  “In theory this means there is greater scrutiny and accountability through a licensing process. “But in reality, the majority of animal research projects are not scrutinised before they take place and the secrecy of the licensing process has led to a failure to prevent unnecessary experiments. “The uncritical acceptance of animal experimentation by government departments has stled innovation and replacement of these cruel and outdated tests with modern methods.” However, the Royal Society, the -year-old organisation which says it is the “worldaposs oldest independent scientic academy dedicated to promoting scientic excellence”, backed animal testing with safeguards. It said: “The Royal Society believes that all research should be carried out with a high regard for animal welfare.  “At present, the use of animals remains the only way for some areas of research to progress. “The Society believes that where this research offers considerable benefits, it should go ahead under rigorous review to ensure it is absolutely necessary and there are no alternatives. “At the same time steps must be taken to replace the use of animals, reduce the numbers used and refine procedures so the degree of suffering for animals is kept to the absolute minimum.” In its online response to the petition, the Government said there was “an explicit exclusion under the Animal Welfare Act  to provide for the legitimate conduct of procedures on ‘protected animals’ for scientic or educational purposes that may cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm”.  It added: “The use of animals in scientic research remains a vital tool in improving our understanding of how biological systems work both in health and disease. “Such use is crucial for the development of new medicines and cutting-edge medical technologies for both humans and animals, and for the protection of our environment.” Scottish National Party MP Martyn Day will lead Monday nightaposs three-hour Westminster Hall debate, with Home Office Minister Kit Malthouse responding for the Government.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s formula will see low income households pay at least £ extra when the energy price cap rises by £ next month. But shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves claims she could get that figure down to just £.Mr Sunak last week announced a cut of £ in Bands A-D Council Tax, and a £ loan to all households using electricity. Some will also get an extra £ on the Warm Homes Discount. But Labour reckons it could hand £ to nine million poorer families plus an additional £ on average to every household. Writing in today’s Sunday Mirror Ms Reeves said: “The Wonga Chancellor is giving with one hand now, to take it all back later.” The global rise in wholesale energy prices has already led to  energy suppliers going bust and lting the cap could see bills rise %, from £, to £, a year. National Energy Action predicts that could push an additional . million households into fuel poverty. Labour says the answer is to scrap VAT on domestic energy bills for a year, increase the £ Warm Homes Discount to £ and expand it to nine million eligible homes. That would be paid for by a % windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas and, coupled with extra receipts from other taxes, raise £.billion The Wonga Chancellor is giving with one hand now, to take it all back later by Rachel Reeves, shadow Chancellor  For many families across Britain the story is the same. Bills up. Shopping costs more. Purse strings pulled ever tighter. The government had a chance to take action on the cost of living crisis but millions are still worrying about their bills. Many are struggling, with a record number of people in January wrestling with fuel debts. As the Chief Executive of Money Buddies debt advice in Leeds warned: “I’ve been involved in debt advice for  years. This is the worst Iive ever seen it.” And what did the government do  Simply offered a buy now, pay later scheme that loads up costs for tomorrow. High prices as far as the eye can see for years to come. And most of the plan not even coming in till October.  The Wonga Chancellor is giving with one hand now, to take it all back later. Labour’s plan to keep people’s bills low would impose a one-off windfall tax on the excess profits of North Sea oil and gas producers – who have made a fortune through this spike in prices. It cuts VAT on home energy bills to %, as part of a package saving most households £, with extra targeted support taking £ in total off the bills of those who need it most.  Under the Government’s new plan, low income households will still see a minimum rise of £ on their energy bills. With Labour’s plan low and middle-income households will see a rise of just £ – almost completely eliminating the increase. Britain is uniquely exposed to the global gas crisis, because of a decade of dither and delay from Conservative governments. And unlike Labour, they have no plans to cut people’s bills or tackle our insecure energy market. One thing the last week has taught us - it’s Labour that’s focused on bringing prosperity and security to families across Britain.

And she blamed the Prime Ministeraposs researchers and advisers for hoods Boris Johnson has said in Parliament, insisting he tells the truth to the best of his knowledge.The Culture Secretary appeared affronted when she was asked by host Charlie Stayt when she last spoke to Boris Johnson, whom sheaposd been sent on TV to defend. Asked when sheaposd last spoken to the Prime Minister, Ms Dorries shrugged, looked quizzically into her webcam, and replied: Why  During the exchange, Stayt said he was really confused, asking Ms Dorrieshis question was a dficult one. The presenter asked: Have you spoken to the Prime Minister recently, in the last  hours  After a brief pause, a smiling Ms Dorries replied: Why  Why are you asking me that question  Stayt replied: Iaposd like to know. Dorries simply said: Weaposve communicated.  Appearing perplexed, Stayt went on to say: Iaposm really confused. Is that a dficult question  Iaposm just askingyouaposve spoken to the Prime Minister, in the last  hours. Dorries repeated: We have communicated. Stayt went on to ask what Mr Johnson had communicated to her, but Ms Dorries declined to go into detail. She said: Iaposm not going to tell you the extent of my communications with the Prime Minister. I mean, Iaposve answered your question. We have communicated. What is your next question  When Stayt asked about the PMaposs mood, Dorries described it as very positive, extremely positive. Elsewhere in her media round, she mixed up two Tory MPs with the same surname, claimed % of Tory MPs back the PM and blamed remainer enemies for plotting against him. She admitted there are a number of reasons actually, itaposs not just one, but she said: That certainly is at play with a group.  However, out of the  Tory MPs who have so far publicly called on Boris Johnson to go, just seven of those had publicly backed remaining in the EU in the  referendum.One of those who has said the Prime Minister should go is David Davis, who served as Brexit Secretary, and another is strident Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen.But Ms Dorries told Times Radio: There are a small number of voices, whether they are people who were ardent supporters of Remain, who see this as their last opportunity to reverse Brexit. Ms Dorries was also forced to insist Mr Johnson tells the truth as the PM came under sustained pressure over the future of his premiership. She said Mr Johnson told the truth to the best of his knowledge based on what he was told by his aides. Challenged about a claim made by Mr Johnson in the Commons about the number of people in work before and after the pandemic, Ms Dorries told BBC Breakfast: He will have been given by advisers and researchers the fact that there were more people in work than there were at the beginning of the pandemic, not on the payroll. She said: So did he tell the truth when he quoted that  Yes, he told the truth as it was given to him. I can personally tell you that the Prime Minister, when he stands at the despatch box and makes quotes like the one you just quoted, is because the researchers and his advisers will have given him that quote, and thataposs... and he was truthful, to the best of his knowledge, when he made that quote, she said. She added: The Prime Minister does tell the truth.  Honesty was one of the key reasons former minister Nick Gibb said on Friday that he could no longer support the PM, and had submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady. Writing in The , Mr Gibb, MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, said his constituents were furious about the double standards and he said the Prime Minister had been inaccurate in statements to the Commons. He said: The Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Allegra Stratton for joking about a Christmas party that she hadnapost attended, but he wonapost take responsibility for those that he did attend. I am sorry to say that it is hard to see how it can be the case that the Prime Minister told the truth. The MP said: To restore trust, we need to change the Prime Minister. Backbencher Aaron Bellalso declared publicly he had submitted a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in his leader. John Glen, a Treasury minister and Salisbury MP, said the situation with No  was deeply uncomfortable, disappointing, and embarrassing. Writing in his local newspaper The Salisbury Journal, he did not call for the Prime Minister to resign but said: The culture in Number  fell short of what the country had a right to expect, and responsibility must be taken for the mistakes that were made. The interventions brought the number of Tory MPs who have now publicly called for Mr Johnson to resign to . Privately, the number is expected to be higher.  Mr Johnson also lost five No  aides in  hours on Thursday and Friday. But Ms Dorries insisted % of Conservative MPs were behind the Prime Minister.This included, she said, the Health Secretary following comments over the Prime Ministeraposs allegation that Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile. She said: I spoke to Sajid Javid last night and he reassured me that he is % behind the Prime Minister.In fact, I think heaposs quite shocked at how his comments have been interpreted.  Mr Javid said Sir Keir deserved absolute respect for the job he did as director of public prosecutions and that it was important that the Prime Minister claried his earlier accusation that Sir Keir had failed to prosecute Savile.Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak had said he would not have made the comments.Ms Dorries said her Cabinet colleague was entitled to his views. Ms Dorries told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that anybody who leads an organisation, like the Prime Minister leads the Government or Keir Starmer led the Crown Prosecution Service, when something goes wrong, you take responsibility and you apologise. She said: Rishi Sunak is entitled to his views and you know, heaposs entitled to say... make any comments that he wants to. Ms Dorries was defending the Prime Minister as other Tory MPs are expected to consider over the weekend whether to write to the chairman of the  Committee Sir Graham in an attempt to force a leadership contest.Former minister Dr Liam Fox has said he is waiting to see what comes out of the full Sue Gray report into the partygate saga.Mr Johnson was facing fresh accusations on Saturday after The Mirror reported that the politan Police had been handed a photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at an alleged gathering in June  to mark the Prime Ministeraposs birthday.

Examiners will also be asked to be more generous than in previous years to account for the disruptions to education triggered by the pandemic. Pupils have suffered a third academic year of Covid-fuelled chaos to their schooling.But ministers pledged boosted support for youngsters so they are not unfairly penalised by the Covid- crisis.Some content, texts, topics and sub-topics, themes and skills due to be assessed have been made available for the majority of GCSE, AS and A-level subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Exam boards today published the details of topics that will appear in exams as part of changes to ease the pandemicaposs impact on grades.  The advance information is aimed at cutting the amount of content pupils need to be taught or tested on. In all subjects apart from English literature, history, ancient history, geography and art and design, pupils will be given notice about the topics to be covered in this summeraposs exams. The Department for Education said the extra information “aims to focus students’ revision without providing exact questions that will appear”. It added: “Advanced sight of the content is one part of the adaptations in place to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on education, recognising this cohort of students were affected by school closures during periods of lockdown and disruption due to absences. “Other adaptations include a choice of topics in some GCSEs like English literature and history, and support materials like formulae sheets in maths.” Jo Saxton, chief regulator of exams watchdog Ofqual, said: “Students have shown so much resilience during the pandemic and we know that they are seeking certainty. “Advance information published today is one of the ways we are supporting students to have that certainty as they prepare to show what they know and can do. “We are also ensuring there is a safety-net for students with a generous approach to grading.” Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said: It is extremely important that this really does help to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on learning, and we will be studying it in detail to ensure that it provides fairness to students of all ability levels. National Education Union joint general secretary Mary Bousted feared the release of advance information “comes too late” for kids. “There are grave concerns amongst teachers of exam groups that this will not be enough to fairly mitigate the disruption these students have experienced over two academic years,” she added. Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan claimed children and teachers “have had weeks of needless stress and uncertainty awaiting the information being published today, which for many pupils will feel like scant compensation for months of missed learning and development”.  An Ofqual spokesman confirmed there will “be generous grading” this year. He added: This will be delivered after marking is complete and when senior examiners set grade boundaries. “It is likely to mean grade boundaries will be a little lower than they might have been in a normal year, but grade boundaries are never set in advance, and so we cannot be precise at this point in the year.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said exams ”are the best and fairest form of assessment, and we firmly intend for them to take place this summer, giving students a fair chance to show what they know”.He added: “We know students have faced challenges during the pandemic, which is why we’ve put fairness for them at the forefront of our plans. “The information to help with their revision published today, as well as the range of other adaptations, will make sure they can do themselves justice in their exams this summer.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsGCSEsA-levels\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Johnson has been calling Conservative MPs as he bids to shore up his embattled leadership. The PM dialled up former Defence Minister Johnny Mercer - a prominent critic - but Mr Mercer soon forgot what the conversation was about.The MP’s we Felicity Cornelius-Mercer tweeted at .pm on Saturday: “So..funny story…the Prime Minister rang tonight directly after an afternoon of FA Cup football and England rugby.“Andwas so p***** he can’t remember what was said. “Thinking of winding him up tomorrow…I heard Johnny Boris say………suggestions please.”  Mr Mercer posted this morning: “In other breaking news, wives have a mind and a le of their own. “She’s on this nuts journey with me - the highs and many lows. “She is more than entitled to take the p**s out of me the PM whoever she likes.”It comes as embattled Boris Johnson faces a crunch week for his crisis-hit premiership as Tory MPs hold his fate in their hands.The beleaguered Prime Minister reportedly hopes to limp through to Friday when the Commons goes into recess for February half-term. But he could be just days away from a vote to oust him as rattled backbenchers continue to send Tory  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady letters demanding a no-confidence ballot. Even the PM’s we Carrie has reportedly told friends it might be preferable for her husband to quit No. “She was saying she had had enough a couple of weeks ago. “She was telling friends the pressure on her was too much and sheaposd be happierhe left,” a source told the Sunday Times.But the PM - who vowed this week he would be re-elected in  and said Iaposve got a lot more to do - claimed tanks would be needed to force him from Downing Street.“He’s making very clear that they’ll have to send a Panzer ision to get him out of there,” a source told the paper.Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng admitted there was “fevered speculation” about how many letters Sir Graham has received, saying no-one really knew how many had been signed.Some claims suggest the PM’s critics could be just a handful of letters away from securing a confidence ballot. Mr Johnson spent the weekend building a new inner circle after five aides walked out in  hours last week.The PM appointed former BBC journalist Guto Harri as his top spin doctor, and parachuted in Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay to be his chief of staff.But three previous Chiefs of Staff voiced doubts over whether itaposll be possible.

Billy Baxter, , from Blackburn, was kned in the heart and lungs on the evening of September  last year while walking near his home in what is believed to be a row over a girl. He had to undergo le-saving surgery after the attack and has since been left with a -inch scar running down theof his chest. His mum Jessie Brian, , found out about the attack when Billy messaged her on Snapchat to say he was on his way to hospital. She said the teen had been left traumatised by the incident and the family now plans to move out of the area. His  year-old attacker - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was sentenced to just  months in custody for the offence last week.  He was originally charged with attempted murder but this was downgraded to wounding with intent by the Crown Prosecution Service. Jessie hit out at the sentence, calling it a slap on the wrist while Billy had been forced to turn his back on his le and ambitions. Billy wanted to be a plumber and now heaposs too scared to go out of the house just when he got his confidence back, she said. Itaposs heart-breaking what heaposs done to my son, and in court, he held his head up high like nothing had happened. Iaposve been around this area for  years - itaposs the only area that Iaposve known - and now we have to leave because the attacker knows my address and so does his family. Billy has ADHD and autism and had spent more than two years without leaving his girlfriendaposs house due to his lelong developmental disability. But they broke up shortly before the attack on September  last year and Billy moved back home with Jessie. He was ambushed after leaving the house at around .pm to meet up with a new love interest. Jessie said: Heaposd been in a relationship, and heaposd found out she was cheating on him, so he came back home after isolating with her for two and a half years.  I said to Billy, Just get out there! You need to start socialising with people and making new friends. Forget about everything thataposs happened. So heaposd met this young girl, and managed to get to town and to see her, but then he heard his name being shouted across the road. He put his hood down and didnapost want any trouble, but next thing he knew the lad was in front of his face, and he got stabbed straight in the chest. Jessie said she found out about the stabbing after Billy contacted her over messaging  Snapchat in the minutes after it took place. She said: I got a phone call from one of his friends on Snapchat, and it was actually Billy on the phone saying that he had been stabbed. I thought it was someone having a joke because it didnapost sound like Billy. It was only when he said: It is me, mum, Iaposve been stabbed and Iaposm on my way to the hospital, thataposs when I found out. Billy was rushed to hospital where he required a le-saving operation after doctors found out he had internal bleeding. Jessie said: He was stabbed in the chest, between his heart and his liver. It pierced his heart, as well as cutting through a tube that runs from his heart for the blood supply, and slashing his liver. They had to open him up and pull his rib cage back and do an operation on his heart, and they had to repair the tube as well. It was an operation that he had to have within  hours - a le-saving operation - because he had internal bleeding as well, which is very, very dangerous. She added: It was a nightmare to tell you the truth, it really was a nightmare. Billy was left with a huge scar running down his chest, along with a couple of smaller ones dotted just above his stomach. But Jessie said that the poor lad was also left with mental trauma, which continues to this day. She said: My -year-old who wanted to go to college and be a plumber hasnapost got a le now because he wonapost go out. He feels very conscious about the scars. He talks about it every single day. Itaposs not just one little scar. Itaposs one big massive scar and two scars underneath it. Jessie also feels the sentence that her sonaposs attacker received wonapost deter other kids from carrying knives in the future. She said:  months is a slap on the hand. This boy who did all this will probably get out and get a job or whatever, and my son is left not knowing what to do next.

Personal preference generally guides buyers when it comes to question of what is the best milk.Sam Honey of KentLive says the go-to buy is semi-skimmed without question. But, which supermarket is the best to get your dairy fix While brands like Cravendale are undeniably good, the price can be a little off putting, especially when sat next to supermarket own brands. In order to answer this question I visited four main supermarkets to try out their dairy offering and answer. Our competitors here are Iceland, Marks  Spencer, Tesco and Aldi, in each I grabbed semi-skimmed and began comparing. Iceland First up on the list was the favourite of mums everywhere, Iceland. While I did go looking for  pints in each shop as I’d argue thataposs the most common size bought for a weekly shop, my local Iceland only had single pints. Obviously this isnapost going to affect the taste in any way, only the price- a quick trip to their online store however tells me that the going rate for two pints of semi-skimmed is p, a fair priceever there was. Now onto the taste, and I’ve got to say, I was pretty impressed.  One of the main things that can go wrong with semi-skimmed is getting the balance right, don’t want things too watery or too full, and Iceland got the balance perfectly. A quick taste test and I really was reminded of the flavours found in the likes of Cravendale, not quite exact but definitely similar, so we’re off to a great start here. Aldi No budge in price on this one either at p, itaposs down to the taste to set this one apart. In complete honesty, my experience with Aldi has been very hit and miss over the years Sometimes they absolutely knock it out of the park and deliver truly surprising quality at a discount price - other times I’ve been left feeling like I should have just paid that little bit extra for better quality where. In terms of price, there is a recurring theme here as all of these choices cost about the same, with Aldi also costing p.  When it came to taste though, this was a little underwhelming- this time around the milk did border more on the watery side of the things. It was by no means bad, but for my own personal tastes, not exactly what I was looking for. When looking at the price it would be hard to justy buying this over Iceland’s offering for the exact same amount of money. Tesco Next up on this dairy quest came Tesco, the place for all things valuetheir marketing is to be believed. No budge in price on this one either at p, itaposs down to the taste to set this one apart.  It was a definite improvement on Aldi’s, and was almost identical to Iceland’s, perfectly balancing the flavours and keeping the optimal consistency. Those two are now neck and neck, so it is down to our last choice of the day to see who will come out on top. Marks  Spencer When you think about quality, MS almost certainly comes to mind, the supermarket giant is known for it, from both their advertising and their ability to deliver on it too. The trade-off however, is that you will usually be paying that little bit more, and this theory rang true. But, not to worry, as the price mark up was literally p, with two pints of semi skimmed milk costing me p, hardly one to break the bank. Now the question is, does the taste beat out the other two or will we be left with a tie for first place   The suspense is palpable, you could almost drink it!Simply put, MS blew the other two out of the water, tasting near identical to the likes of Cravendale. This really was a delicious glass of milk, and would be perfect for all things from cereal to tea.

The player appeared a bit embarrassed during the exchange but kept smiling as she warned Kate she just “wanted to make you aware” before they performed the line-out, thereported. During the demonstration she jokingly let out a surprised “Oooh” as she was lted up into the air. Then the player profusely apologised, saying: “Oh, I’m so sorry” before Kate and her host burst into another round of laughter.  Other footage also showed the Duchess enjoying the demonstrations, letting out a whoop as she was lted up by her companions. Kate was visiting Twickenham after it was announced that she was the new patron of the Rugby Football League and the Rugby Football Union on Tuesday.She is taking over from Prince Harry who was stripped of his patronages after confirming he would not be ing to work on behalf of the Royal Family after a one-year trial away.

The little animal, known as Pearl, was found in the backyard of County Cat Rescue in a dreadful state with no fur on her body and infections. Pearl, who is six-months-old, was taken to a vet who gave her ointment to ease the pain caused by her scratching but her condition worsened when she lost an eye.Maria Miller, the owner of the charity, told the Liverpool Echo : “Our building is an old bank, and the wall is at least -feet-high, so she has come down with a bang.She had no fur on her, her body was like a hard shell. She was so infected and we had to get her seen to because she was constantly scratching due to her skin. Pearl had to have steroid injections, but she carried on with the scratching even when it started to grow back in patches, but then she scratched her eyeball.  One day when we came to the rescue we found her hiding in the cupboard, and when we got her out of there, her eyeball had exploded. We rushed her to the vet, and they had to operate and take her eye out, and sheaposs only six months old now.Maria added they put up a post on Facebook to try and find who she may have belonged to as she wasn’t chipped or neutered, but nothing came of it.A fundraiser was set up by Joanne Bonner, to help with the costs of Pearlaposs treatment. Maria said: We are only a small rescue and not really well known, we have been going for about three years, so it is hard for us sometimes, but we will never turn anyone away who needs help. Joanne helped us out a lot, and has been fundraising for Pearl to help pay for her operation. If it wasn’t for kind-hearted people we would have been stuffed. Sheis doing well now, she still needs a steroid injection every month to help with the scratching, we do not want her to lose her other eye. “Her fur is growing back and she is eating normally, she just deserves a loving home after everything she has been through.

This week Bellfield has allegedly owned up to the murders of Lin and Megan Russell, a confession which could prove the innocence of heroin addict Michael Stone, , who claims he was wrongly jailed for the  murders. The ex-partner of Bellfield and mum to his four daughters, Rebecca Wilkinson, told the Mirror she believed his claims, which were made in a letter to Stone’s solicitor Paul Bacon. Ms Wilkinson, who is mum to Bellfield’s four daughters, told the Mirror: “Yes, I believe it. I knew he would say it after his mum died.”  They were together for six years in s and broke up one year before the murders of Lin and Megan Russell. She added after yesterday’s revelation: “It’s just unbelievable really. I think I’m lucky to be alive.”  Stone’s barrister Mark McDonald said he will be asking Scotland Yard to investigate the case - and will write to them this week. Lin Russell, , daughters Megan, six, and Josie, nine, and their dog were tied up and bludgeoned with a hammer in a country lane in Chillenden, Kent. Lin and Megan and the dog died but Josie survived. Mr McDonald said: “It’s time for the Met to review this case and interview Bellfield, that’s what we want. “We will be writing to the Met this week asking them to take a look at the case.” Mr McDonald said of Kent Police, who carried out the original investigation: “This is not a police force that should be looking at this.”He added: “Michael Stone is innocent and must be immediately released from prison. “Stone has been in prison for  years despite plenty of evidence that this is a miscarriage of justice.” In Bellfield’s statement to Mr Bacon, he says he was wearing a ‘pair of marigold washing up gloves’ and had the hammer in his right hand as he stopped the Russell family walking along a lane. He claims his intention was ‘to just attack Lin’, but quickly changed his mind on hearing the screams, presumably of Megan and Josie Russell. The -paragraph statement then goes into detail about how he led the Russells from a track before killing them, and then drove back to his Twickenham home before heading off to work. He claims the following day he threw the hammer he used into the Thames near Walton, Surrey.  He ends the statement by saying it was the first time he had ‘committed a crime and another person has been arrested for it’, before apologising to Stone and the Russell family ‘for my heinous acts’. There are major questions around Bellfield’s “confession” including evidence from his former we that she was with him on the day of the murders. A Met police investigation in  received evidence from Jo Collings that they were together for her th birthday on the day of the killings in Kent.  Ms Collings, who gave evidence against Bellfield and is described as “the very last person” who would try to protect him, previously said: “He never left my side all day and all night, so there is absolutely no way he could have gone from Twickenham, where I lived, or Windsor, where I kept my horses, to Kent, done what they say he did and got back without me not knowing. “I hate to say it but, hand on my heart, I can say he didn’t do it.” Former bouncer and car clamper Bellfield is currently serving a le sentence for the murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler, , in .  He has also been convicted of murdering Marsha McDonnell and Amélie Delagrange and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, and will never be considered for parole. Mr McDonald admitted there is nothing in Bellfield’s statement which has not previously been in the public domain, raising the possibility he has fabricated it using known facts. Colin Sutton, the former Met detective who caught Bellfield, said last year when the monster claimed he was in the area at the time of the murders: “Knowing Bellfield as I do, this could be him playing mind games.”  The Met Police did not comment last night. Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Fotheringham of Kent Police said: “Following two trials at which Stone was found guilty by a jury on both occasions, and an appeal to the High Court, Michael Stone remains convicted of the murders of Lin and Megan Russell, and the attempted murder of Josie Russell in .  “Michael Stone made an application to apply for a Judicial Review in respect of his conviction in September . The Honourable Mr Justice Blake ordered that permission for the application should be refused. “The Criminal Case Review Commission commenced an extensive re-examination of the murder investigation in  and has had access to all forensic evidence, documentation and exhibits from the original investigation, the review by Hampshire Police, details of the two Crown Court trials and appeals to the High Court.

Lucy admitted she usually spends around £ each week to feed her family-of-four, and their pet pooch.But this week she headed to budget retailer Aldi - the supermarket voted the UKaposs cheapest by Which  last year - to seeitaposs still possible to live on such a small sum. To help make her budget stretch she went to the store prepared, with dinner ideas that would last for lunch the following day, she told Hull Live. She splurged £, nearly a quarter of the budget, at the meat aisle on mince, sausages, chicken breast and meatballs . She then went to get her fruit and veg, and spent £ on salad items, onions, potatoes, and fruit including blueberries and bananas. This cost £, knocking the budget down to £ with bundles still left to buy. She added: I picked up four tins of tuna and some cooked ham and chicken for sandwiches, and then also headed to the bakery aisle for bread and eggs. On my way I picked up some yoghurts for the boys, along with some cheese. My husband had already picked up some milk the day before.  Lucy works full time for the publication and has two young boys, so says that frozen goods are essential for us at times. So for those emergency meals, Lucy bought some chicken nuggets, a ready meal for while working the late sht and a pizza for her hubby. The family were struck by Covid just a week ago, so needed to stock up on other essentials, including rice, cereal, pasta and sauce packets, she said. And to keep her lads happy, Lucy threw in a six pack of teddy bear crisps and party ring snack packs - which are necessities for the boys. Though she was pleased with how far the money stretched, her trolley didnapost look half as full as it usually was. Lucy added she was lucky to have some high-cost items like nappies and wet wipes stocked up at home, with essentials like tinned tomatoes and baked beans already in the cupboard too. To keep to the  limit, she had to ditch Diet Coke and Fruit Shoots for the kids. Lucyaposs Prosecco was also scribbled off the list as was her husbandaposs beer. The weekly shop came in at £. - just over the planned spend. Some of the homemade meals they had this week included: Breakfast - Blueberry and coconut baked oats Lunches - Cheese, ham, tuna sandwiches or saladsDinner - Sausage and mash, Chilli-con-carne, Turkey frying pan nacho , Chicken stir fryAt the end of the week, Lucy said she felt the family were far more careful about what they ate, but that it would be a struggle keeping to this budget. She said: My youngest goes to nursery at the moment for four-days-a-week and has a hot meal there which I was very grateful for. But anyone with children knows they still eat you out of house and home. All in all I felt like we were a lot more careful with what we ate and not as wasteful - which can only be a good thing. It would be a struggle keeping to this budget. I know we are lucky too as both my husband and I work full time so probably earn an average income - but of course, we have the childcare fees to add to this. I really feel for those who are struggling to make ends meet and I am afraid it is just going to get worse.

Three consecutive disastrous Conservative PMs. Replacing Johnson with a fourth would ditch a cynical charlatan obviously deserving the boot.But the real problem isn’t who sits in No  but the Conservative Party itself, a political organisation incapable of governing Britain competently and fairly. Three flops in a dozen years, arguably the worst troika to occupy Downing Street in history, is a damning record. Cameron’s cuts and austerity inflicted pain, choked economic growth, piled up debt and squeezed the le out of the NHS before he lost Europe in a backfiring tactical referendum. May played a bad hand badly, fumbled a needless General Election and lacked the skills to keep together a disintegrating party. And it’s touch-and-go whether Johnson, by far the most contemptible of the trio, survives with even the charlatan’s praetorians darkly whispering he’s finished should the lockdown reveller be handed a fixed penalty notice for brazenly breaking the law.Vultures are circling over the Primate Minister who quoted monkey Rafiki in The Lion King to bemused Downing Street staff.Frantically ringing Tory MPs, he’s terried  will write letters demanding a leadership contest.The Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer blowing up in Johnson’s face represents a con man losing his touch.  In the past he’d throw a grenade to create a ersion. Now it rolls back to mortally wound him. Plummeting living standards, tax rises, rocketing inflation, battered public services, rising crime, sleaze, corruption and all those party lies are owned by the Conservative Government, not just Johnson. Standing somebody  on No ’s steps mightn’t do it again for the Conservatives after four General Elections. Increasingly people want genuine change instead of more of the same. Which is why the odds are shortening on a fth election producing a new Government, Labour ing to power. Folk mistreated and taken for fools eventually revolt.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

On February , , her father George VI died aged  and the then -year-old Elizabeth ascended to the throne. The Queen was in Kenya with her husband Prince Philip, at the beginning of a huge royal tour of the Commonwealth. Technology at the time meant it took a long while for the sad news of the Kingaposs death to reach the royal party.The Queenaposs aides first learnt of the news and grappled with how to tell their boss about her fatheraposs passing - which also meant that the throne was now heraposs. In the end, they told Prince Philip, who then had the tough task of delivering the news to his we. And according to Lady Pamela Hicks, the Queenaposs lady-in-waiting, Philip knew the Queen would be heartbroken on hearing the news.In her book Daughter of Empire, Lady Pamela says that Martin Charteris, the Queenaposs private secretary “went in to tell Philip, who lted his newspaper to cover his face in a gesture of despair, saying ‘This will be such a blow’.”Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .  Philip then went to tell the Queen and aides watched as the couple walked back and forth through the garden. What was said is a mystery but Pamela tells how afterwards the Queen “remained completely calm and said simply: ‘I am so sorry. This means we all have to go home.’” The group began their hasty journey back to Britain on the royal BOAC Argonaut, refuelling in Libya where a black coat, handbag and shoes were delivered. The Queen arrived back in mourning garb to meet dignitaries including Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Since then, Her Majesty usually marks February , the day of her ascension, in private at Sandringham, where her father died. Tomorrow will be especially poignant as it marks  years since that fateful day - but it will also be the first one without her husband Philip by her side who died aged  last April.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghKing George VIRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her -year reign has stretched from the post-war years through a new millennium and into a radically altered st century. She has served as a symbol of stability as the world has changed in countless social, cultural, political and technological ways over the intervening decades. The Queen was extremely close to her father, and one of her childhood friends said he set her a wonderful example for her time as monarch.Anne Tennant, Lady Glenconner, who was a maid of honour at the Queen’s coronation, told BBC Radio ’s Today programme the Queen would likely “look back very sadly” on the day as it also marked the death of her father, George VI.  She recalled being sent a letter by Margaret, the Countess of Snowden, describing the “beautul Norfolk morning” on which the king had died at Sandringham. “ a beautul Norfolk morning, sun coming out and all the geese and the birds flying over, and she said it was a sort of perfect morning that her father would have loved and it was so wonderful that he had died in Norfolk, his beloved Norfolk, on such a beautul day,” Lady Glenconner said. She described the “moving” moment she watched Elizabeth on television ing from Africa with the knowledge she was to become Queen. “It’s so moving, standing at the top of the stairs in her black coat. And suddenly, somebody that we’d known, I’d known, since she was a child, was Queen. “She was a very slight figure and she was very young but I felt that she had, from a very young age really, she knew she was going to be Queen. I think her father was a wonderful example to her because he put his every duty first.” Asked whether the anniversary would be tinged with sadness for the monarch as it was also linked to her father’s death, Lady Glenconner said: “I think the Queen will look back very sadly.” She added: “I think it means a lot to her. She’s a countrywoman too, the Queen.”Last night, the Queen released a statement to mark the occasion - thanking well-wishers for their support and confirming she wants her daughter-in-law, Camilla, to become Queen Consort when Charles takes the throne. She wrote: It is a day that, even after  years, I still remember as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign. As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in  that my le will always be devoted to your service. As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth.  I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family. I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign. Earlier this week she shared photos of her looking through cards and gts sent from well-wishers to celebrate the Jubilee, with a little help from her dog Candy. People around the world have paid tribute to the Queenaposs today, sending messages to congratulate her on the unprecedented achievement.Her eldest son, Prince Charles, said:On this historic day, my we and I join you all in congratulating Her Majesty The Queen on the remarkable achievement of serving this nation, the realms and Commonwealth for seventy years.“The Queen’s devotion to the welfare of all her people inspires still greater admiration with each passing year. “We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother’s wish. “As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling we has been my own steadfast support throughout. “The year of this unprecedented Platinum Jubilee brings an opportunity for us all to come together in celebrating the service of The Queen, by whose example we will continue to be led in the years to come.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Her Majesty The Queen has been one vital and valued constant in an ever-changing world, representing security and stability for our country, during the ups and downs of the last seven decades.While today’s date will always be one of sadness for Her Majesty, as she remembers her beloved father King George VI, it is a chance for the rest of us to express our gratitude for a le of unprecedented dedication to duty and commitment to our country.On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to express my deepest thanks to Her Majesty for seven decades of unparalleled public service.Her Majesty is a global symbol of grace and dignity and we thank her from the bottom of our hearts for her  years of selflessness and service as we celebrate Her Majesty The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.

He claims the Queen also hopes Prince George, who is third in line to the throne and will one day have the weight of the crown on his head, will be up front and heavily involved in the celebrations. It comes after the Queen used her jubilee message to tell the world she wants Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, to become Queen Consort when Prince Charles takes the throne. Cawthorne told Love Sunday magazine: Thankfully, the Queen has the strong arms of William and Kate around her shoulders.. I think we’re going to see Her Majesty’s grandchildren really step up this year and her great grandchildren, especially George, will be up front and heavily involved in the celebrations.  The Queen will be experiencing a whole gamut of emotions – everything from grieving her husband and remembering her father, to feeling pride towards all that she and her family have achieved. She took the throne of a bomb-scarred nation and steered it into a period of political stability. That is an incredible legacy. She knows William, Kate and their children will find a way forward for the royal family. Meanwhile, royal expert Duncan Larcombe believes the chaos within the royal family is still daunting, despite the Queenaposs popularity.  He tells OK! magazine: She’s probably as popular now as she was at the beginning of her reign. If anything, she has really come into her own during Covid, making addresses while everyone was in lockdown in a way that really cemented her in this role of the nation’s grandmother. This year is a unique moment in history and the Queen has a lot to be cheerful about, but there are, of course, looming crises on the horizon. Last month, the Queen’s third child, Prince Andrew, was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages as he faces a US civil action over sexual assault allegations – claims he has consistently denied.  Meanwhile, Prince Harry, the Queen’s fourth grandchild, is seeking a judicial review against a refusal of the Home Office to allow him to personally pay for police protection while visiting the UK. The Duke of Sussex lost his taxpayer-funded police security after stepping back from royal duties in  and movingto the United States with his we Meghan and son Archie.It’s like watching the matriarch of your family – your mother or grandmother – getting older while issues are still unresolved,” Nigel adds. “It’s obviously lovely to still have her around at the age of , but it’s rather daunting because the rest of the family seem to be in such a mess. We’ve depended on the Queen for most of our entire letimes and I’m not sure anyone  is up to the job.

The home of Margaret Tyler, , is so crammed full of memorabilia decided to Her Majesty it is occasionally mistaken for a museum. The grandma, from Wembley, north west London, has met the Queen four times and she has an entire room exclusively for the Queen’s jubilees. Various bits of memorabilia, photographs and books about the Royals fill the space, which is where Margaret will be marking  years on the throne for the Queen.  Margaret, who has four children and four grandchildren, said: I have met her four times and my legs were like jelly after meeting her each time - she was always so kind and sweet. The most recent time, I ran all the way home to tell my daughter on the phone. I was puffing and panting so hard, she thought I was having a heart attack! She added: I hope Her Majesty enjoyed her day - itaposs an amazing thing she has been doing for all these years.  Whenever anything has happened, the Queen has always been there for us and gets us through it, even though she has a lot on her own shoulders at the moment! For more than four decades, Margaret has been decorating her home with every picture, trinket and piece of memorabilia imaginable.  She owns hundreds of books and pictures, as well as some more obscure items - such as cardboard cut-outs of Her Majesty and the Royal corgis. Margaret admits she has no plans of slowing down her royal obsession, let alone sell anything. She said: My collection of memorabilia keeps growing but Iaposll never sell anything even though the house is bulging at the moment. My house is like a museum - people have even knocked on the door to ask what time we open - someone even askedI am a member of the Royal Family myself! Itaposs just what I do - I think about the Royals all the time and Iaposll talk about the Queen to anyone who will listen. Margaret grew up a an only child alongside two royalist parents, and said she began to adopt her love for the British monarchy from a young age. She was just eight when Queen Elizabeth II was first coronated - and recalled being broken-hearted when her father wouldnapost buy a TV so she could watch. The Queen became the first British monarch in history to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee today.  On her th birthday on February , Margaret took a trip to one of her favourite places - a royal memorabilia shop - and picked up several new items. But she doesnapost even have to buy everything herself now - she says people in her area know who she is and drop memorabilia items on her doorstep because they know how much she appreciates them. I donapost ever sell anything - I just canapost. I look after it all and I always want more even though my house is bulging at the moment. I spent yesterday with my children, and I was thinking and talking about The Queen while sat in my Jubilee room. It was a day of remembering everything amazing she has done.

He said: That first lockdown was great, long walks with the we, barbeques, glorious weather.It was a bit of a taste of retirement for me, I think it gave people a bit of perspective on what is really important in le, for me that was family. I wonapost say it hasnapost been dficult for the shop though, my we was asking me what money I was spending while it was closed and I told her aposyoursapos.  With being closed a while I guess you worry that people might forget about you, in a way weaposve missed a whole generation of kids in those two years who were coming up to the age theyaposd want to be in here buying jokes and tricks. Weaposre still here though and it is much the same as it ever was for us, I think that is something that people love, they can bring their kids in and get the same experience they got when they were small. George was originally a record seller and gramophone repair technician, he would later branch out into books, magazines, bicycles and the novelties and jokes the shop is known for today. Graham came into the business in  after having been made redundant. My grandma worked at the shop and she asked meIaposd like to work the holiday season as there was a shop in Scarborough too, he said. When it came to an end she said Iaposd got the personality for it and would I like to stay. I think itaposs just because I could talk the hind legs off a donkey, I donapost shut up. I always say in retail youaposve got  seconds to make people comfortable in your shop so Iaposm always in there with a joke, a aposhow are youapos, a smile and a laugh.  In amongst the fun and laughter there are some very modern problems that are putting pressure on Dinsdales outside of the ious lockdowns. Shipping issues including the rising price of container space are putting Grahamaposs profit margins at risk and some of the makers of the novelties in the far east have simply disappeared. Graham says stock has never been harder to get hold of and with lower footfall in recent years, the business remains on a tight leash. Despite this, he feels the reputation and pull of Dinsdales will see it survive for another generation to enjoy, one of the stalwart ever-presentaposs in Hulls shopping scene. Graham said: It is dferent times now with the internet and social media but I think jokes and tricks still have a place. And evenit is just a bit of nostalgia, we have people bringing in their children and grandchildren to see us and weaposre always wanting to entertain. That is the way it carries on, from one generation to the next, weaposre still here doing our thing and we will still be here in years to come.

There’s also a possibility of snow and “blizzard conditions” with chances of a few inches of snow falling in higher altitudes in Scotland.The Met Office predicted that Dalwhinnie, Scotland, could see the brunt of the Arctic weather waking up to the -C temperatures this morning.Through yesterday into the night the country saw showers, some of which were wintry in the north of England and Scotland.  They cleared later on and winds eased which means much of the UK will wake up to frost on Monday. Monday itself will see a cold, bright start, with cloudy skies with patchy rain and drizzle sweeping eastwards The day will become windier as it progresses and will see milder temperatures from the west.  Moving into Tuesday, the snow will have disappeared in England, but could remain in parts of Scotland. The Met Office predicts moving into Tuesday through to Thursday, rain will heavily affect northwestern areas and spread towards the southeast toward the middle of the week. Thursday onwards, the country’s likely to see colder conditions with the chance of wintry showers and more wind in the north.  More rain will likely see much of the remaining snow in Scotland melt. Looking ahead towards the middle fo the month, the north can expect a mixture of wintry showers and wind, interspersed with rain. Whereas the rest of the country can expect far more dry periods with plenty of sunshine.  From Friday, the northern parts of England and Scotland can expect wintry showers, which will become lighter and less frequent as the day goes on. The rest of the UK is expected to be dry and sunny. Into the weekend, gales and heavy rain could make afor the northwest and west.  Again, most of the rest of the country will be dominated by a patch of high pressure. Heading towards mid and late February, temperatures are likely to be close to average, but there is the potential for cold snaps especially in northern and eastern parts.

The Nightingale hospitals were built across the country to tackle waves of Covid- at a cost of £million alone to open up.Only one of the hospitals - the Royal Preston Hospital in Lancashire - has admitted patients.According to NHS England’s annual accounts released last week, the health service has suffered the huge loss due to the beds not meeting the required standard, MyLondon reports.Some of the millions of pounds written off include paying for storing the beds.  One of the hospitals at the ExCel conference centre in Canning Town admitted a mere  patients even though it opened with  beds and a total capacity for , patients. A note from the accounts says the loss “relates to emergency beds that were procured for the Nightingale hospitals at the beginning of the pandemic and includes storage costs. “These were bespoke beds for field hospitals and the order made was based on the demand projections at the time, it read. After the closure of the Nightingale hospitals, it was deemed that the beds could not be used in any other existing hospitals as the specications were not to the current standard as implemented in all hospitals.  The Nightingale hospitals have proven to be expensive. Overall the Nightingale hospitals, across the UK are expected to cost taxpayers more than £ million. Safety concerns at the Nightingale hospitals, which struggled to recruit enough staff, were such that few were used as intended. An NHS England spokesman told The Times said: “The Nightingales were created to provide additional capacity in case this was needed through the pandemic. This included securing beds that were appropriate for patient use, with local areas using these as needed.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TimesNHSJersey ShoreHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jame Rogan, , made the decision to go sober last April after a number of failed attempts to stop drinking alcohol over the years.At his heaviest, James weighed just over st but is now down to st after trading nights out, for working out. The mechanical technician from Nuneaton, West Midlands, says that as well as making a huge dferent physically and to his physical health, cutting alcohol from his diet has massively improved his mental health. James used to drink  pints and spirits in an evening when he went out. He said: I was binge drinking pretty much every weekend, which started because I used to play rugby.  Obviously thataposs a sport with a big drinking culture, and I was just working in an office job straight from school. Iaposve never really had an off-switch with alcohol like most people do, I never knew when it was time to stop. Iaposd have one drink, and that was almost like a self-destruct button, and then there was no going back after that. Now, as well as cutting the drink, James works out regularly every week, and feels better than before. He said: I go out on hikes, Iaposm exercising regularly every week, Iaposve started doing kickboxing, which Iaposm really enjoying. I feel much much better, and I never feel like Iaposm missing out or anything. I went to a mateaposs stag do a few weeks ago, and leading up to it I was a bit nervous, but I had a great time. Everyone is really supportive as well, obviously once the drinks start flowing you get people saying like, aposcanapost you have oneapos and things like that. But mostly, when I tell people theyaposre interested, or curious, more than anything . Before, James revealed how he got into a negative cycle with drinking, felling physically bad because he had drunk, then drinking again. He said: Iaposd be binge drinking at the weekends, and then feel crap all week, and just do that over and over. It started to put a strain on my relationships, and I just wasnapost happy.

He first took a break from alcohol back in , when he took part in dry January for the first time. James said: I took a month off, thinking that that might help me be able to handle the alcohol more. The next year, in November  I decided to take a full year off to sort it out, and I did, but I went back to drinking November . Each time I took a break, Iaposd be back in the same habits within a few weeks, so I knew I just to cut it out for good. James started charting his journey with sobriety on his Instagram@_drysociety.He said: I wanted to start that just as way to support other people.

The imposing house would have dripped with luxury when it was under the ownership of a wealthy aristrocrat in the Deep South of the US. But it is now an exquisite example of how much of America’s heritage is being left to rot. One picture shows a sparsely-decorated bedroom, curtains still drawn, with what appear to be a wedding dress and a tuxedo hanging on the walls, presumably belonging to the house’s owners. Another of the photos shows what seems to be a reception room, the grandeur of the wide windows and fireplace dulled by the dust and dilapidation of time.  The pictures were captured by urbex photographer Leland Kentin Union Springs, Alabama in the USA. They show the Rainier-Lewis House, built by Union Springs Mayor Sterling Price Rainier Jr in  to house just himself and eventually his we and three children. With just five inhabitants at the time, space was abundant in this twelve-room mansion, which was completed less than  years after the close of the US Civil War in . The elegant building features four large Corinthian columns, a romantic second-floor balcony, and a stained glass window on the interior stairway.  After Sterling’s death in , the house lay vacant for decades, the grandeur of its past disappearing. It was then purchased in  by Dr. Hikes-McDonald in , who worked for the Veterans Administration for many years, but decided to leave the house empty once more when she moved to Chicago. Other shots in the set show the grand hallway, carpet faded and dusty, a vintage porch complete with two old rocking chairs, and the exterior of the house, still impressive but showing signs of its age - as it is now  years old.  The fades grandeur of the once impressive mansion can be seen in photographs taken by Mr Kent who posts images of places he has managed to get a peak behind the grand facade of the property. They also show grand staircases flanked by pillars and many other large rooms which have no-doubt seen some impressive soirees during the previous occupieraposs ownership.  Sterling Price Rainer, Jr. started work on this -room mansion in . It was completed in , and has four large Corinthian columns, a romantic second-floor balcony, and a stained glass window on the interior stairway. Rainer was born on January , , and raised in Union Springs. And his dad Sterling Price Rainer, Sr. was a successful merchant and served as Probate Judge of Bullock County. According to AbandonedSouthEast he later served on the city council for four years before becoming Mayor and finally served in  as a State Legislator from Bullock County.The site says he lived just a few blocks away in a modest home which was constructed in the s. The website says: In , the Rainer-Lewis House was sold to Dr. Hikes-McDonald, who discovered the home for sale through the internet.  She purchased the home and moved to Union Springs to retire after working for the Veterans Administration for many years. Her brother, Robert Hikes, retired from Honeywell Corporation in Massachusetts and moved into the home accompanied by their poodle.

Toni Carran, , bought the house in  and was amazed as it still had its appliances from nearly  years ago including a stove and a fridge. Now the mum of one has filled the home with items she has found in antique stores with her personal collection standing at around  original pieces. Toni, a customer support specialist, said: “I walked into the house, and I saw the appliances, and I just knew that I had found my place. “As soon as I saw this stove, as ridiculous as this sounds, I had to have the house. “It was the showstopper I have the original advertisement and the original owner’s manual. The appliances are from  and they are in pristine condition, they work and operate as good as anything you can buy today. “The entire house was untouched, they never painted the house, the floors were the same. It was just this untouched time capsule house, it was perfect for me. “This was the only house I looked at and I knew I was going to buy it.” Despite her wallet-busting hobby, Toni’s favourite item is a decorated wooden, spherical ottoman- a Franco Albini first edition Rattan Pouf- which cost just £. Toni, who bought the ranch in Halax, Pennsylvania, US, added: “I began collecting vintage antiques in  and I think it was the nostalgia that drew me in.  “Not because I lived in that time, because I was born in , but it just gave me the feeling of seeing my grandmother’s house. It’s the comfort of those things that have withstood the time. “I don’t think people realise the value of what they have. That’s what I had a lot of luck with, is finding things that people would give away, they wouldn’t think of it. “I have an eye for this, I found items at an antique store that look like they have no monetary value. “And then I get them and do research on the objects and I’m like ‘wow I made a score’. “They’re cared for, they’re displayed, some people might think it’s trash but it’s my greatest pleasure, collecting and taking care of things.”  Before moving into her s crib, Toni loved to wear vintage reproduction clothing, competing at pin-up shows. She said: “I do dress in mid-century clothes but not all the time, not every day but I do pin up contests, a couple of those. “I’ve done car shows and pin-up contests, I’ll go antiquing and I’ll wear a dress just for the fun of it. You have to be comfortable standing out in a crowd and that’s always been me – standing out in the crowd. “There are some people who take this to a whole other level, I do it for a lot of recreational fun.

TikTok user Michelle, @theflowertruck, got a series of text messages from the young woman who seemed to be struggling with most appliances.She asked about the fridge, saying it was aposlockedapos, and asked how to turn on the gas for the oven - which was actually electric, as the Daily Star reports. Michelle uploaded the amusing exchange to TikTok, where she captioned the video I just need to knowmy Air BB guest is OK, and now her video has been viewed more than  million times.What do you think about Michelleaposs guest  Let us know in the comments...In the clip, Michelle shares the text message exchange with the guest who chose to stay at her Air BB in St Catharines, Ontario, Canada. The first message reads: Hi I just wanted to confirmI could use the refrigerator because itaposs locked  Michelle says there is no lock on the fridge and maybe she should try opening it from the other side.  Ok yes sorry, replies the guest, which is followed later by: Hey the gas isnapost turning on. It turns on for two seconds and then goes back off. How can I fix this  The baffled owner replied with: What do you mean by gas  Her guest explained she was trying to cook and it becomes apparent she has no idea how to use an electric oven.  You should just turn the hob and leave it in place. There is no gas, said Michelle. The guest still doesnapost understand and sends a photo of the stove, with Michelle advising her to turn the knob onto high for cooking. Apparently defeated, the guest later orders some takeaway food but then messages Michelle because she canapost find it. The delivery driver said he left it on the porch but I canapost find it. Did you receive it  asks the guest. Michelle then shows CCTV of the porch, which shows the takeaway sitting on the floor practically next to the door, with footsteps in the snow even showing where the delivery person walked. One user commented: Your guest was definitely two children in a trench coat. Tried to get ingredients, tried to cook food, then decided to order delivery.   finished successfully, said a second. A more sympathetic user suggested the guest may have been new to the country and not understood how appliances work.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Others shared spicy situations of their own, as one person revealed: My gran makes a toxic sandwich on purpose when I was a kid... told me not to eat my lunch that day.

Over the years there have been several sightings of a young woman reportedly seen crying in the middle of the road.And now Rachel says she has eerie footage showing Catherone’s skeletal face which appeared at the same time they heard tapping on their car window, reports Wales Live.Rachel, who leads the Retford Ghost Hunters, said: “I believe we caught Catherine. I know there are sceptics out there, but this is my line of work. “As part of our team, we quite often go around places to look for potential locations for ghost sightings.  My friend and I were researching the area and came across a story about a haunted road and the Metheringham Lass, Catherine Bystock. We parked up on the road which was built on top of a runway. It was the former site of RAF Metheringham. It was freezing conditions. We used a technique of a call out: aposCatherine, are you here apos and relayed the story of Catherine Bystock. We had, what we call, cat balls. If someone taps the ball, they flash. We put one of those on the front of the car. I pulled the window down and I said: apos anybody is here, let us know.apos Then, suddenly, there was a massive thump on the car, this frightened us. As well as that, the ball on the front of the car had started to flash. We were livestreaming this at the time, and we could see that people had noticed the ghost. After ing home, Rachel said she was flooded with messages about the sighting and reviewed the footage. She says she can see Catherine standing in front of their car. She added: It even looks like she had her hand like she was holding a cigarette. You could even see her skeleton face. I have heard stories about people seeing her and her asking for help. It was scary. I have been doing this for  years now and I didnapost expect to see this. After years of visiting haunted locations across the country, Rachel continues to battle the sceptics and provide evidence of sightings on her social media page. She added: Itaposs the continuous interest of the unknown. Weaposve never found the answer, but we always say: aposWeaposve not found the answer, but we do have fun trying to find itapos. To the sceptics, we say come along. To a certain extent, I am a sceptic. But, come along and see what we do. Over the years, we have seen many ghosts and use an earpiece app and Bluetooth speakers so we can listen for any potential sounds. Weaposve also had the classic bangs on the ceiling.

He said his sisteraposs wedding was coming up and his girlfriend of six months had been invited, and when they were planning what to wear she revealed she would be wearing a very high pair of heels.

He said: She called me silly and brushed off my concerns which was not appreciated. The day of the wedding I hid her pair of high heels.

I started telling her to hurry up so we could get to the venue on time and she ended up wearing flat sandals as a replacement. Everything went well, and I gave her high heels back once we got home.

Giving them a good old clean not only makes them look a darn sight better, but it helps them toproperly - and it can help lower heating costs as the build-up can prevent heat from escaping.One woman who was eager to clean her radiator took to Facebook to ask for advice.

Use a hairdryer to blow it out, make sure you put newspaper down underneath as youaposll be amazed what comes out, they said. Another person commented: I’ve just used a hairdryer on mine. It was fantastic and the dust that came out was disgusting - absolutely loads of it. Give it a go, you will be shocked what comes out. A few other people suggested that she use a radiator brush, orshe doesnapost have one of those, one person said she could make her own out of a microfibre cloth and a hanger.

Chris Bakon was ing for rock lobster when his friend spotted a menacing fin on the surface.We initially thought it may have been a great white shark so we went to check it out, he said.But what the pair, who were fishing off Ship Stern Bluff in southeast Tasmania, Australia, encountered was a sunfish - the largest bony fish on Earth. The fish seemed huge underwater the size of a van easily, he said. At first when I was swimming with it I was a bit intimidated due to the size, but after a few seconds I calmed down and was just in awe.  It was such a magical thing to see underwater. In Chrisapos footage, he turns the camera on himself and captures the mighty sunfish swimming behind him. He also films the creature with one of its sides turned towards the surface, soaking up the sunaposs rays in a bid to regulate its body temperature. The sunfish is known for its huge size and its freaky appearance, with some saying it looks like half a fish due its lack of a tail fin. For Chris, a former soldier who served with the Australian army in the Middle East, encounters like these help heal the scars of a traumatic past.He now documents his underwater experiences on Facebook and YouTube, where he is known as Tassie Adventure Man. I had no idea about these fish and definitely wasnapost expecting to see one, he said. I feel pretty lucky to experience it. I started ing and opened the Tassie Adventure Man page to help manage my PTSDand mental health. They keep me motivated, and keep the stress and triggers at a manageable level for me. Mr Bakon, , hopes he can help others this way. He said: I found once I started ing, all my anxiety and PTSD would just disappear. Itaposs also turning into something that I can use to help others which is amazing. I like to show people that you can still have a good le even while youaposre battling with mental health.

The first of , soldiers to arrive in Europe following the Pentagon’s announcement of additional forces to back Nato members on the continent were pictured touching down on Sunday. The XVIII Airborne Corps will provide a Joint Task Force-capable headquarters in Germany, as , Paratroopers from the nd Airborne Division deploy to Poland. More than  members of Britain’s elite special forces have been sent to Ukraine this week. Crack troops from the SAS, the SBS, the Special Reconnaissance Regiment and the Special Forces Support group are understood to be working in the country as military advisers.  They are believed to be helping train Ukrainian special forces in counter-insurgency tactics, sniping and sabotage. A Stryker squadron of around , U.S. service members based in Vilseck, Germany would be sent to Romania, it was announced this week. Three hundred other service members will move from Fort Bragg to Germany.US President Joe Biden said the deployment was consistent with what he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin: As long as he is acting aggressively weaposre going to make sure we can reassure our Nato allies and Eastern Europe that weaposre there, according to media reports on Twitter.On Wednesday The Mirror met the commander of Ukraine’s Army Oleksandr Syrskyi, a four-star General, at an air-strip outside Kyiv.  He told us how Ukraine was defending against the growing Russian threat from its eastern flank, where there are , Russian troops and Belarus to the north, where there are , including Russian and local forces. He said: “History shows that they may take any kind of action and carry out any provocation and we are ready for anything. “But we keep up with our ceasefire regime in order to prevent any provocation.” He stressed Ukraine’s forces are being shelled and shot at daily along the -mile trench frontier between his soldiers and pro-Russian separatists backed by Moscow’s regular forces.  On Friday China joined with Russia in opposing further Nato expansion in the face of Western pressure. Moscow and Beijing issued a statement showcasing their agreement on a raft of issues during a visit by Russiaaposs Vladimir Putin for the Winter Olympics.

Hundreds of rescuers worked tirelessly for five days to rescue Rayan Oram, five, who fell through the narrow opening of the well last Tuesday. On Saturday the world held its breath as the team, some of whom had been digging with their hands, finally reached him and brought him to the surface. The jubilation soon turned to tears when it was found little Rayan had not survived. Now Moroccan international footballer Abderrazak Hamdallah says he wants to buy the heartbroken family a new home to help with their despair.  The -year-old, who played under former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson after a move to Chinese Super League side Guangzhou, said: “We have gone through five very remote days and our hearts were snatched from us, Moroccans, all Arabs and Muslims, and even the whole world. “We praised and thanked God for everything that Rayan took, and he was more mercul to us and more deserving of it than us “With this affliction, I extend my deepest condolences to Rayanaposs family, and I ask God to grant them patience and solace.  “And I have decided, in my name and my family’s name, and in the name of all Moroccans and Muslims, to help and bring a little joy to Rayan’s family, his parents and his brothers and give them a fully equipped house. We ask God to accept us and make it in the balance of the good deeds of all Muslims “This is help from a brother to you and Godaposs mercy.”  The message comes after Rayan’s mother and father were given a guard of honour on Saturday night by rescuers. His mother, Ouassima Kharchich, said: This is Godaposs will. I thank all for their efforts to help. His dad, Khalid Awram, added: We thank so much the people and authorities... who helped us. Atiqua Awram, the little boy’s aunt, said: “My heart is aching for him.”  One social media user said of the gesture by Hamdallah, who played and scored against Newcastle in January: “This made me feel things I can’t describe.” Little Rayan fell into the well in the hills of Chefchaouen on Tuesday, triggering a huge rescue effort which was followed by millions around the world. The operation involved cutting much of the adjacent hillside and then tunnelling toward the bottom of the well to reach the child who was kept alive by food, water and oxygen lowered from the surface through a tube. Efforts were hampered by fears of landslides and there were cheers on Saturday evening when he was brought to the surface. Soon afterwards the worst was confirmed as a statement from Moroccoaposs royal palace confirmed he had not survived, with many rescuers bursting into tears.  An onlooker said: I heard people shout in jubilation after the boy was found thinking he was alive but then we learnt he was not. I never felt this sad.Among the onlookers was Bwa Sahraoui who dug with his bare hands for five days with limited rest and was among those who cleared the last few feet of rubble to reach the trapped boy on Saturday. He was cheered on social media as stories of his dedication were shared online. Pope Francis praised the people of Morocco for coming together to try to rescue the boy.He said: The people clung together, as a whole, to save Rayan, they worked together to save a child, the pope said during hisweekly blessing in St. Peteraposs Square.tried their best, unfortunately they did not make it.Also among well wishers to the family were French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, as well as football clubs including Liverpool, Manchester United, Barcelona and Sevilla who expressed condolences on their Arabic Twitter accounts.AC Milanaposs Algerian midfielder Ismael Bennacer added: Rayanaposs courage will stay in our memories and continue to inspire us. Ryanaposs funeral is believed to be scheduled for Monday.

It is the first time the gruesome attacks have been recorded - shedding fresh light on marine ecosystems. The orcas, or killer whales, even swim inside their giant preyaposs mouths - eating their tongues before they die. An Australian team stumbled across the phenomenon during an annual survey off the Perth coast. Isabella Reeves, a PhD student at Flinders University, Adelaide, said: When we arrived about  killer whales were attacking the blue in  metre waters, with the female killer whales leading the attack.  At arrival we already noticed a substantial flesh wound on the top of its head with bone exposed. The dorsal fin was missing, no doubt bitten off by the killer whales. Tooth-rake marks were evident in front and behind where the dorsal once was and even all the way to the whaleaposs tail. Blue whales are the largest creatures to ever live. They can reach up to  feet long and weigh  tons - as much as  elephants. Their heart is the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, according to World Wildle Fund. Females are bigger than males. The discovery could help save the endangered species. There are about , to , left in the wild.  Lead author John Totterdell, of the Cetacean Research Centre, Western Australia, said: Soon after, there was large chunks of skin and blubber stripped off the sides of the whale. The blue was bleeding profusely and was weakening, evident by its slow speed. Coordinated attack by several killer whales resulted in some females ramming the side of the whale while others attacked the head. Close to the end, a female animal lunged head first into the blueaposs mouth, presumably to feed on the tongue. The whale weakened more and we did not see the carcass again. After the whale carcass sunk, about  killer whales were in the area feasting and sharing around the blueaposs flesh. The grisly event described in Marine Mammal Science happened nearly three years ago. Just two weeks later a blue whale calf was taken by many of the same iniduals. A similar incident occurred last year.  The chaos also attracted flesh-footed shearwaters, albatross, storm petrels and groups of more than  long-finned pilot whales. Orcas are the ocean’s apex predator - mainly feeding on fish, squid, seals, sea birds. They are much smaller than blue whales - reaching up to  feet inand weighing over six tons. Until now, it was thought they only ate whale calves of much smaller species - such as grays and humpbacks. Understanding their role in the food chain is vital for monitoring their prey - including those still recovering from commercial whaling. In Australia, two populations of killer whales have recently been discovered - and both feed at least in part on marine mammals. One, found off the west coast, has over  known animals to date. They roam the waters mostly during summer and autumn. Mr Totterdell said: These guys are ferocious with a preference for squid, fish and beaked whales. In recent years recordings of the number of beaked whales taken have increased, in this region they are known to also predate on humpback and minke. Killer whales attacking and harassing blue whales has previously been documented. But the three attacks are the first confirmed kills. The unique hunting strategy,successful, results in tiring out and immobilising the blue whale - leaving it defenceless and an easy target. Added Mr Totterdell: It is suggested that killer whale predation has impeded gray whale population recovery in the Northwest pacic. Yet in Australia, with many whale species known to be targeted by killer whales, the impact of their predation on these populations remains unknown. This study, combined with our recent research, highlights the need for increased understanding of killer whale population ecology so we can better determine their impact on the marine ecosystem in Australian waters.

The chilling video was broadcast on websites and pretends to show a Ukrainian bomb-maker putting the final touches to a time bomb containing radioactive material. Wording beneath the video claims the blast will spread radioactive waste three miles from ground zero of the explosion. The terrorist wears black latex gloves and warns Ukraine will kill thousands and poison a three-square mile area. It was intercepted and exposed as another attempted  flag mission to spark conflict as , Russian troops gather on Ukraine’s eastern flank and over , Russian and Belarusian troops are north in Belarus.  There are heightened fears Ukraine is facing a massive invasion by Moscow’s forces. The video is soundless and features Ukrainian wording whilst pretending to be made by extreme right wing group National Corps party, who are not in parliament. In chilling footage designed to stir up unrest and give Moscow an excuse to invade Ukraine the pretend terrorist lts the lid on a black container revealing a timer and wiring connected to yellow and white plastic bags.  It is said to contain “radioactive” material. He then unscrews the detonator and places a mobile phone with a flashing red light next to another phone primed to trigger the blast. A caption next to a logo of the National Corps Party reads: “Remote controlled explosive device with radioactive elements. “Zone of effect  km. It is devised for the partisan war. It will be used in the case of Russian army invasion in the territory of Ukraine”.  The video first appeared on the Telegram channel and has been broadcast on Russian sites. “Dirty Bombs” are made from nuclear waste packed around a high explosive charge designed to kill many once detonated and contaminate a wide area with radiation for years. The footage was circulated days after US intelligence intercepted another Russian-made fake in which actors were used to play Ukrainian militia and corpses.  Kremlin spies planned to release footage of a staged Ukrainian attack on Russia or pro-Russian separatists. It apparently showed graphic scenes of blown-up buildings and bodies. Actors were used in the fake footage, posing as troops and corpses and it is believed British intelligence agencies veried the plot.  Ukraine’s Stop Fake monitoring organisation has identied a string of inflammatory Russian-backed videos in recent years. They include depictions of Ukrainian “Nazis” crucying children, burying enemy troops alive and executing pregnant women. Another showed a former police chief in Donbas capital Donetsk having his throat cut - but the “killing” was staged using make-up and fake blood. The National Corps Party said of the dirty bomb video: “This video is a poorly made fake, and this whole story is a work of sick imagination of Russians to discredit Ukraine.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RussiaUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club.

I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him.

We need to get charging points into the right places.“My aspiration would be to see charging points outside every village hall right across the Borders.”SBC’s regime will see the introduction of an overstay charge, a minimum charge of £ per session and a p connection surcharge between pm-pm to ease demand on the electricity grid at peak times.An SBC report states: “Based on usage figures for  this gives a potential income in the region of £, a year, creating a surplus of around £, a year to contribute towards maintaining the current infrastructure.“This excludes overstay charges which would also generate additional surplus and would also allow scope to absorb any small increases in energy prices without the need to constantly alter the tarf.”A feasibility study has been commissioned, funded through the Community Renewal Fund, to undertake “a region-wide, cross-sector assessment of supply, demand and commercial opportunities to create a strategic delivery model for EV charging infrastructure”.At the meeting, Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson, of the SNP, said: “It’s great news there’s going to be an electric vehicle feasibility study to look at how we get private sector investment equitably across the region despite the disperse nature of our rural population.“It’s absolutely essential that the private sector don’t cherry pick the most financially viable sites and leave the other sites without any sort of provision.”.removeSBC’s current EV infrastructure consists of  chargers across  dferent towns and villages, according to the report.A November meeting was told that the total cost to the council for the charging points last year was £,.Supporting the proposed tarf rates, Galashiels councillor Harry Scott said it was “a nonsense” that the council provides the service for free and that the local authority should “benefit commercially from the use of these machines”.He added: “There has to be a certain amount of caution before we go down this road because the tech seems to gallop on quite signicantly and what we don’t want to be doing is spending £-, installing a machine that might be redundant in a year’s time, so it’s right that the officers keep an eye on this.”"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-road-works-frustrations-voiced-meeting","story":"GALASHIELS is “riddled with poorly-maintained road works”, according to a councillor for the town.At a council meeting last week, independent representative Harry Scott raised concerns over “shoddy” repairs carried out on Abbotsford Road near to the fire station.And he asked Gordon Edgar, the executive member for infrastructure, travel and transport, when a “full and proper” reinstatement of the road surface will take place.Mr Edgar, a Selkirkshire councillor, said: “This has been causing considerable angst among officers and temporary repairs were undertaken by the contractor back in September, and it had been expected that the permanent reinstatement would have taken place long before now.”He said that Scottish Borders Councilofficers had spoken with the contractors at the start of the year and last week.“They have assured officers that they have made arrangements for this work to be undertaken and hope to confirm the date in the next few days.”Responding, Mr Scott said: “This has been a really frustrating case.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The Royal Mint has revealed its top ten rarest  pence coins in circulation.The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.What makes a coin valuable The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

He was a proud RAF Regiment gunner, and very proud to serve his country.My le and the lives of our five daughters changed forever when I heard the heart-breaking news that Gary had been killed. His vehicle had hit a landmine, killing Gary and his friend, Livi. The driver and commander survived but they were severely injured. Gary was .In the wake of this devastating loss, the RAF Benevolent Fund came to our assistance and helped my daughters financially through university.That prompt and unconditional support was the foundation upon which we could begin to rebuild our lives. Knowing that the fund was there for us gave me such a sense of assurance for our future.In honour of the RAF Regiment#s th anniversary, the RAF Benevolent Fund has launched a dedication page where members of the public can thank, commemorate and celebrate all those who served and are serving in the RAF Regiment.Visit rafbf.org regimentdedication to share stories and memories of your loved ones."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 4 2022","story":"Things are slowly ing to normal, but for many, #normal# will not be theThere have not been many positive aspects of this epidemic, but there was, at least at the beginning of the first lockdown, a resurgence in caring and kindness being shown in communities people helping neighbours with shopping or checking that the more vulnerable in society were being cared for.Kindness and love are powerful factors in building a strong and happy society in which everyone feels valued and included.At the heart of the Christian message there lies Jesus’ command to love one another and to love our neighbours as ourselves summarised in the #Golden Rule#: Do onto others what you would have them do to you.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

Having come up with m hits such as Rubber Bullets, I’m Mandy Fly Me and the quite sublime I’m Not In Love, the band split in .As is almost always the case, ‘creative dferences’ were cited. Today, a new line-up of cc exists fronted by band original Graham Gouldman, appearing in Glasgow in the Spring. Yet, he’s still profoundly sad at the way the immensely clever, melodically ingenuous art-rock band was allowed to fall apart.“We certainly saw it coming,” he says of Kevin Godley and Lol Crème’s desire to pursue experimental music. “And with hindsight we know how we should have handled it. But I still regret it. It’s incredible to think what the four of us could have come up with had we carried on.”Shouldn’t they have taken a break at the point of ‘creative dferences ’ “That’s exactly what Kevin and I have said. Taken a year out. But at the time, they wanted to finish their Consequences album, and Kevin and Lol were also a little tired of the cycle of cc recording.”Gouldman is still friendly with Kevin Godley, who contributes video to the new stage show. But what of the relationship with Eric Stewart, with whom he continued as cc and had a series of hits including Dreadlock Holiday and The Things We Do For Love. “I can’t really comment on that,” he says, firmly.Oh, well. What he will talk about is his quite incredible career. So here’s a rewind question what was it like to be just  and have chalked up eight million sales as a songwriter for bands such as The Yardbirds , Herman’s Hermitsand The Hollies  Did he high tail it out of industrial Salford for the Cheshire equivalent of Beverly Hills and a swimming pool and champagne on the cornflakes lestyle  “I hear these sales numbers but all I can say is they are often exaggerated,” he grins. “It’s like when Meat Loaf died. They said he’d sold  million albums, but I bet he didn’t make  million quid.”He adds, grinning: “I did move to Cheshire at one point. But I didn’t get into the music business for that reason. It’s always been about loving what you’re doing.”A music career was almost an inevitability. “When I was seven, I played the drums using my mum’s handbag and hairbrushes for sticks. When I was eleven, my cousin brought me back a guitar from a Spanish holiday and I loved it.”The teenage Gouldman saturated himself in the music of the late Fties and early Sixties such as Clf and then the Beatles. He joined a series of bands playing every venue imaginable, from Jewish Boys’ League Clubs to Bernard Manning’s Embassy Club.The fun to be had on the circuit was unimaginable. But the money was desperate. Aged , he left school to work in a gent’s outfitters, a job his parents lined up for him. “I wasn’t very good at school but that was fine because I was so focused on music,” he explains. Thankfully, he was given his P from the gent’s shop. “I was playing in a band at the time, The Mockingbirds,and the boss had enough of me coming in late in the morning, struggling to stay awake in the shop.”Gouldman now concentrated on playing music, and songwriting for talent such as Peter Noone, of Hermans Hermits. “I knew I had a gt for writing songs, and my dad was a great inspiration. He worked in the clothing business, but he was also a great writer, who wrote poetry and articles for newspapers.“He helped me write lyrics, and I’d let him read my songs as I wrote them. Later on, during the days of cc I’d call him up when I was stuck for a phrase or whatever. He used to say to me ‘Art for art’s sake, money for God’s sake’, which of course became one of my songs.”Is it fair to guess that Le is a Minestrone wasn’t one his dad’s suggestions  “That’s a fair guess,” he laughs.In and out of a series of bands from the mid-Sixties to the early Seventies, and the Strawberry recording studio in Manchester, he would connect with fellow hopefuls Eric Stewart, Lol Crème and Kevin Godley. Here were four major talents who wrote and played clever avant garde material. So was it a given they’d get together, like a musical rom-com, in which friends who find they have so much in common come to realise they’re in love  “Well, I’m not surethat’s how I’d describe it,” he laughs. “But I do agree it seems that us forming a band was inevitable.”Success didn’t arrive immediately. Record company rejections hit hard. In , the band, as yet untitled, came up with a Fties pastiche Donna,and in desperation took it to producer Jonathan King because they reckoned he was ‘mad enough’ to sign them. He was. It was hit. King also came with the band’s name, after having dreamt he saw a sign saying ‘cc play the Hammersmith Odeon.’ “The deal we had wasn’t very good but we went on to have hits, so we were grateful for that.”Donna illustrated the group’s ethos. “We made it for our own pleasure, like every song we recorded. It was nothing to do with you, the public. We never thought about writing hit songs. Just songs.”The magic of cc, apart from powerful melodies and quirky lyrics, emerged from their musical unpredictability. It was impossible to guess what they would produce next. Or sound like. “We had three Number One records with three dferent singers, It was the  release of I’m Not In Love however that rewrote the future for band. Yet, Eric Stewart’s original version, Gouldman reveals, didn’t work. “We all agreed it was crap. The song was good, but it was originally done with a bossa nova beat. Thankfully, Kevin came up with a dferent rhythm and tone.”The result was an elegiac masterpiece with lyrics that caused hearts to miss beats. It resulted in leaving Jonathan King behind and a new, fabulous five album deal. How did he cope with success  Did le become one of rock star excess, legions of groupies and drug-induced self-abuse “Not really,” he smiles. “Our northern upbringing helped keep our feet on the ground. I’m a happily married father-of-four and I even resisted moving to London, which the rest of the boys did, until I eventually relented when working with Andrew Gold in the mid-Eighties.”There is a sadness in the that original line-up will never reform. But Gouldman is thankful for the journey, having been part of a band that ran in parallel lines to Queen in terms of imagination and musicality. And to be still performing. He will be  when he comes to Glasgow with the band. “When you do a job you love you still feel young,” he says.A final question. Did he cut his dad a nice royalty percentage, having enjoyed his lyrical input  “I definitely did,” he says, grinning.• cc, The Ultimate Greatest Hits Tour, the Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, April ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-norway-can-never-comparator-scotland","story":"Norway’s achievement was only made possible in a world order to which Norway has contributed very little and the maintenance of which has been borne disproportionately by Britain and the United States. That world order provided Norway with the operational shipping routes, international transport infrastructure, a world financial order, reliable trading treaties and effective import export rules and military superiority over international malign forces. These factors enabled the exploitation of Norwegian oil and the accumulation of the oil reserve fund.Norway, on the other hand, has pursued a long-standing policy of military neutrality and exclusion of nuclear weapons and Nato infrastructure from its soil. If all of the nations of the free world had followed similar policies there would most likely be no free world and no place for a capitalistic economy such as Norway to thrive or even survive. This is now more than ever the case since Norway is reported now to derive more of its income from oil fund investment s than it does from profits from its oil industry and is therefore more dependent upon a free capitalist world order than ever before.This is not to grudge the good fortune of Norway which has, after all, to contend with a frontier with the Russian federation and has, in any case, contributed generously to the promotion of international, peaceful, not military, objectives. It is not, however, a legitimate comparator for Scotland.Michael Sheridan, Strachur, Argyll.WHEN + WOULD BE FAIRTHE most signicant point in replies to my letter of February  by R Murray and Peter Russellconcerns whether a future Scottish independence referendum should be settled by  per cent + of the vote.Of course, as R Murray points out, General Elections come along every five years, but the fact is that of the  referenda organised by several Prime Ministers, not just David Cameron, %+ has been the criterion for success, with a single notable exception. The Cunningham Amendment to the  Scotland Act required % of the Scottish electorate to vote in favour of a Scottish Assembly, as well as %+ of those voting. Therefore, of all the referenda, UK-wide or in a single UK nationor part of a UK nation , the only exception to this rule has concerned Scotland, which the unionist camp now seeks to extend to another independence referendum. Therefore, while %+ has become tradition through “custom and practice”, in Scotland it’s just not adequate.Mr Russell is even more transparent as it is clear that his problem with %+ is when he doesn’t agree with a proposition, such as Brexit. Actually we agree about the folly of leaving the EU, but is it really democracy to call for greater obstacles for a proposition that you don’t agree with  Or is it a symptom of realising that you are losing a debate In that regard, his claim that I see “no need for the nationalists to give us a detailed prospectus” is both wrong and quite telling. My often-expressed view is that both propositions – independence and the Union – should be critically tested. Mr Russell, though, considers the Union case requires none.However, that aside, perhaps scrutiny is the answer, sinceboth propositions have been properly and thoroughly scrutinised in a public debate, devoid of baseless scare stories, and with equal access to the media, then, in principle, do we require an outcome above %+  Merriam-Webster defines democracy as “government by the people: majority rule”. Majority, not majority + whatever percentage it is this week. If that majority has been achieved in open and fair debate, should it not be respected  Or do we look for inspiration to the late George Cunningham Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* THE UK is formed by one nation with a substantial population, and three other minority nationalities. With no written constitution, it should be incumbent on the largest population to respect the rights of minorities, allowing them the same rules, prerogatives and obligations they enjoy themselves. The UK had an EU referendum in , then a UK governmentoffered to hold a second EU referendum in , with neither a majority in Parliament nor electoral approvalfor it.Messrs Murray and Russell think that Scotland should not be allowed a second independence referendum, butone were to occur, then a simple pro-independence majority vote would not count. This is a dangerous nonsense, allowing no legitimate, democratic route to Scottish independence. Meanwhile, the Labour Partyhas stated it would stay neutral on a Northern Ireland border poll, whose constitutional “right to self-determination” is written into the UK constitution. Does Mr Russell agree with his party on this, and what size “super majority” does he advocate for that poll GR Weir, Ochiltree.* I NOTE the debate in your Letters Pages regarding the merits of ious election voting systems in the UK.Suffice to say that the British Establishment always picks a voting system to get the result they want. PR was introduced in Scotland to stop the possibility of the SNP sweeping the boards, both at Holyrood and in local councils, as demonstrated in the SNP waves of  and . In Northern Ireland, from , a property vote and boundary gerrymandering kept Unionists in local council power. The current Northern Ireland system ensures a nationalist unionist balance at Stormont. In multi-racial London, a unique % rule was added to PR to keep racist groups from gaining a major .True to form, British supporters in Scotland want to change the Westminster system because it no longer produces the result they want.Tom Johnston, Cumbernauld.BROWNS WORK SHOULD BE HEEDEDREBECCA McQuillaneffectively counters the unrelenting nationalist opposition to giving the electorate a third option in a future referendum. She points out that two polls this month “show a dead heat between Yes and No”, the inference being that “Scottish politics sometimes seems to be condemned to attrition, but that’s only truethe third way option continues to be ignored”.In this context I refer to the work of Our Scottish Future and its Commissions on Economic Growth , Health , Environmentand Poverty. Each commission “aims to show how cooperative working by governments within the United Kingdom can deliver the change we all seek”.Furthermore, in the first of a series of podcasts Gordon Brown discusses with the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region “the nature of the UK, and on how their cities can work more closely with cities and towns in Scotland”.This is work of real substance which should be welcomed by citizens of all party allegiances and none as a valuable and ongoing contribution to the constitutional debate.John Milne, Uddingston.PAY ATTENTION TO AFGHANISTANAFGHANISTAN, not Ukraine, is the crisis the world should be acting on now. Not only are millions starving and many dying of lack of basic medicines, partly due to western sanctions, but many desperate parents are selling their children as the only way to avoid them starving to death.The posturing by Russia and Nato governments over Ukraine is mostly an attempt by both sides to distract from domestic political issues.

The Taliban certainly share the blame, but more needs to be done by everyone in power.Ukraine has , troops, , veterans, thousands of tanks and artillery pieces, plus anti-tank and anti-air arms and training and the threat of sanctions on Russia from Nato countries to help it defend itself. Afghan children and their parents have no one defending them.The media needs to focus first on saving lives, not on promoting the agendas of governments, nor even Boris Johnson’s farcical Partygate saga.The suffering of the people of Afghanistan and the need to donate to the Disasters and Emergency Committee , plus the need to get governments to act to loosen sanctions and provide aid themselves, should be in the headlines constantly until they do what’s needed.Some, limited sanctions are required to stop the Taliban getting arms and money for them, but the whole population of Afghanistan must not be made to suffer any more.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke."},{"url":null,"title":"young-scots-skier-kirsty-muir-tipped-winter-olympic-medal-success","story":"The young Aberdonian’s talent for performing flicks and tricks in the air has earned her much deserved recognition in the sport - as well as a silver medal in the  Winter Youth Olympic Games.Now , the sports star is currently in Beijing and viewed as a strong medal contender for the Winter Olympics.In recognition of her achievements so far, she has also now been awarded a prestigious award which celebrates adventurous young people and the outdoor pursuits in which they excel.Ms Muir has been crowned the eighth winner of the Scottish Youth Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture for her freestyle skiing.Speaking about her award, the skier said: “I am honoured to be this year’s recipient of the Scottish Youth Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture.“I hope I can inspire people to get out into their local areas and give sports a go.”Ms Muir has been noted for big air, a sport when skiers or snowboarders slide down a high ramp that curls up at the end and shoot themselves into the sky while doing tricks and twists.She also performs slopestyle, which involves tricks and jumps on a sloping course with multiple ramps and obstacles, and halfpipe - in which competitors perform a series of tricks while going down a pipe.She won silver in the freeski big air competition at the  Winter Youth Olympic Games in Lausanne, Switzerland - a moment considered the biggest breakthrough in her career so far.Former Olympic snowboarder Lesley McKenna has been so impressed by her that she described her as a“one-in-a-generation athlete”.Lydia Rohmer, principal and chief executive at West Highland College UHI, which sponsors the youth mountain award, said: “We are delighted that this year’s recipient is so very clearly a young person passionate about achieving her dreams.“Kirsty is committed and driven to overcome any challenges that come her way to reach the top in her sport.“These qualities of resilience and determination are what we endeavour to instil in all our students, as well as a keen desire to share their knowledge and expertise by teaching others, and we clearly see these qualities in Kirsty too.“We wish to send our congratulations to Kirsty and wish her every success in her future career.”Ms Muir, who was previously nominated for the European Olympic Committee’s  Winter Piotr Nurowski Best European Young Winter Athlete prize, started out on the dry slopes at Aberdeen Snowsports Centre, aged just four.By the age of seven, she was beginning to hone her freestyle craft and went on to win multiple awards, including a slopestyle World Cup medal in Aspen, Colorado, at , and several under-age titles at the British Indoor Championships Ski  Snowboard and The Brits Championships.However, despite with widespread acclaim, the young athlete appears to take it all in her stride.She previously said: “I’ve definitely just been trying to enjoy the journey.“There are a lot of dferent things I want to do in my career, and going to the Olympics would be one of them, but I don’t want to make it my be all and end all in a sense.“I don’t think I feel any pressure from anyone. I’m just doing what I can.“In the end I just have to try my best and try to zone everything out.

I just want to go off and ski.“I feel like Mum and Dad want to support me in what I do - I’m so thankful about that.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Looking at the issue more broadly, it’s critical thinking and open debate that powers real and necessary progress.”He said he was “deeply sorry” for the impact the controversy was having on Spoty’s workforce.Whether Spoty continues to keep Rogan or cuts ties, the decision likely will not sit well with one side or the other in an increasingly polarised America.On race, the choice is between keeping Rogan and sending a message that society has become too “woke”, or showing that Spoty is more attuned to a multiracial society, said Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociology professor at Washington University in St Louis.“If Spoty says: ‘We can’t drop him. He has the right to say what he wants,’ that continues on the line where there is this implicit support to say racist things on these s,” she said in an interview before Mr Ek’s letter emerged.The streaming site also has to decide whether offensive words are allowable where on its app, where songs with racist, homophobic and anti-immigrant messages are available, said John Wihbey, a Northeastern University professor and specialist in emerging technologies.“There’s some real self-examination to be doing beyond Joe,” Mr Wihbey said.“This is a big moment of reckoning for entertainment and streaming s to see where the window is, what’s over the line.”Rogan’s public troubles started on January  when musician Neil Young asked to have his music removed because of concerns that Rogan was promoting scepticism about the Covid- vaccines. Other artists followed suit, including Joni Mitchell and Roxane Gay.The scrutiny only intensied when a video compilation emerged last week showing Rogan repeatedly using racial slurs. Grammy-winning artist India.Arie posted it on her Instagram, using the hashtag #DeleteSpoty.Spoty said previously that it would soon add a warning to all podcasts that discuss Covid-, directing listeners to factual, up-to-date information from scientists and public health experts. vw,vw,px, px\"Joni Mitchell also moved to take her music off the  in solidarity with Neil Young “They take this money that’s built from streaming, and they pay this guy  million dollars, but they pay us like .% of a penny,” Arie wrote. “I don’t want to generate money that pays that.”Rogan apologised on Saturday, saying that the slurs were the “most regretful and shameful thing” he has ever had to address, and that he has not used the N-word in years.Mr Ek told The Wall Street Journal last week that he took responsibility for being “too slow to respond” to the criticism over vaccine misinformation. It took the company five days to respond publicly to Young.“It’s become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely accepted information from the medical and scientic communities guiding us through this unprecedented time,” Mr Ek continued in a statement.Rogan is an odd mix of shock-jock and host who leads discussions of public policy, arts and culture, Mr Wihbey said, describing his brand as conservative “bro America”.His comments were clearly racist, Mr Wihbey said, but he hopes that Rogan will see this as a chance to substantively discuss race and vaccine issues in future episodes – otherwise his audience may not hear the discussions.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

They all have had their own personalities and have brought dferent qualities to the job and I’ve enjoyed working alongside each one.”Another positive change Muriel witnessed was the reduction of the speed limit outside the school to mph.“This really helps,” explains Muriel. “It’s such a busy road, especially with all the lorries coming from Larne so mph at arriving and leaving times is vital.“I’ve had a few near misses with speeding vehicles over the years soeveryone sticks to the mph limit it makes it alot safer for the children.”Although looking forward to her retirement, there are aspects of the job Muriel says she will greatly miss.“I’ll miss everyone I work with and of course the children! “I’ll also miss waving at everyone in the mornings and afternoons because I’ve built up alot of friendships over the years and got to know alot of the parents. I made a great friend through the school, Stella Rea who has sadly passed away, but she was something  and a great lady!“I’ll also miss the children and hearing all their stories and woes! I’ve seen many a fall and tumble and witnessed many games in the playground over the years and can truthfully say I’ve enjoyed every minute.”Chairman of the school’s Board of Governors, Mr Jim Allister paid tribute to Muriel’s years of service. He said: “Often schools are valued and judged on the quality of their teaching etc, but equally often the role played by the support staff is taken for granted.“In Muriel we had for decades that invaluable asset of a dedicated partner in delivering the pastoral care and support to our pupils for which Moorfields is renowned.“Not only has she kept generations of children safe in crossing the very busy main road, but she has been that reliable, compassionate point of contact for so many. Through all weathers, Muriel was there to do her remarkable job with the understatement that betokens her caring commitment.“The school is immensely grateful for her decades of service and wish her well in her retirement.”As Mrs Cupples embarks on this next phase of her le away from Moorfields Primary School she was keen to thank all the staff, pupils and parents for their support over the years.“I just want to say thank you to every single one of you who have made my time here so pleasant. Also a massive thanks for all the gts, the cake, the cards and well wishes you all have given me. I’ve made many friendships over the years and I hope they all continue now as I retire.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4423418.jpg--.jpg?1643991652000\n","title":"wrightbus in major recruitment drive for apprentices","story":"LEADING bus manufacturer Wrightbus has announced the recruitment of up to  new apprentices as it gears up for National Apprenticeship Week .The ground-breaking company plans to recruit apprentices in ious roles - including electrical, spray painting, welding, coachbuilding, driveline and engineering. .Wrightbus is supporting its apprenticeship recruitment drive with an open evening on Wednesday February , from -pm, at its Ballymena factory, where people will be able to find out what it is like being a Wrightbus apprentice. Wrightbus sales and business development director, John McLeister, is a huge advocate of apprenticeships. He joined the firm  years ago as an apprentice before working his way up through the ranks.“We’re proud to say our apprentices are playing a key part in driving the business forward,” said Mr McLeister. “We eventually want to have up to  per cent of our workforce on an apprenticeship, via our ious Engineering  Technology Higher Apprenticeship programmes and our general Apprenticeship NI scheme, and this latest recruitment drive will help with that ambition.“They bring ersity, bags of enthusiasm and a fresh approach to problem-solving.”Wrightbus apprentices receive on the job training, working alongside a highly skilled workforce who often act as coaches mentors, along with a college day release programme to back up what they’re learning.Former apprentice Karsten Hall, who started as a design apprentice and now works as a manufacturing engineer, chose a Wrightbus apprenticeship because he wanted to make a start in the world of work.“I wanted a job that provided training and opportunities for progression. I was interested in engineering, so I decided to apply for a Wrightbus apprenticeship,” said Karsten.“From my time on the shopfloor, I gained a lot of hands-on experience with most parts of the build process and a better perspective of how parts are actually assembled and how they can be improved, which helps me in my current role as a manufacturing engineer.”Wrightbus employee Hannah Currie said: “Learning with hands-on experience made a big dference for me, helping with the progression of my career. ‘The experience working with the time-served tradesmen and women, and having such a iety of technology and buses can help you develop so much more knowledge and skills to help you along the way. There are a multitude of opportunities for furthering your career with an apprenticeship.”Sean McAleese, Work Based Learning Managing at Northern Regional College, which works with Wrightbus apprentices, said: “Wrightbus has always been a reliable and trusted employer that has worked closely with the College to develop and implement our apprenticeship programmes at Level , Level  and Higher Level Apprenticeships.“It is great to see the opportunities that have been provided to young people and existing employees who have undertaken an apprenticeship with Wrightbus as well as the high level skills, experience and qualications that they gain. We will continue to partner with the company to identy their training requirements and look forward to strengthening the College’s partnership with Wrightbus in the future.”The National Campaign celebrates the contribution that hundreds of thousands of apprentices make every year to the UK’s economy and encourages more businesses to look to apprenticeships as a solution for recruitment, training, and workforce development. Wrightbus HR Director, Nicola McCloskey, said: “Our apprentices are an invaluable part of our business and we would like to recognise them and thank them for the hard work and effort they put in. They often bring with them new skills and energy, and we’re looking forward to adding to the ranks with this latest round of recruitment.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1643983884189.jpg--covid_19___fri_4th_february_figures.jpg?1643983884000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220204newscovid 19 fri 4th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.

The Provisional IRA were a very professional outfit.”The Lisburn man initially began penning Tango Juliet Foxtrot in  “as a cathartic exercise” — a sort of memoir for his children to read after his death.It ultimately morphed into a book for a wider audience, however, drilling down into the dark places police often have to venture into, and the emotional toll it takes on them and their families.He said the idea behind it was for “people to understand exactly what it’s like to be in the police, not the TV police, such as Line Of Duty, which is just nonsense”.That’s another statement which is unlikely to curry favour with some compatriots in the place the hit drama series is filmed, but Mr Donnelly is unrepentant.“The extent to which the British public love Line Of Duty is only matched by the extent to which British police officers hate it,” he said.“It is so far-fetched and paints a dystopian picture of what policing is like, with this idea that almost everyone is corrupt.“Also, there is all this intrigue... the reality is that the overwhelming majority of police officers are really good people trying to do an extremely dficult and chaotic job.“With that in mind, it’s insulting to them to see these dramatic representations of policing in that way because it undermines confidence in policing.”Perhaps the Midlands-based father-of-four should have pushed for a career as a TV critic.Instead, the young Donnelly attempted to join the Army.“It was the shortest military career in history,” he recalled.“I had a disastrous experience at the Army recruitment office in Birmingham.“I got completely stitched up by a couple of sergeants who sent me away for an hour when I arrived.“When I ed they both looked at me blankly, asthey’d never seen me before, and told me I was late for my interview.“I complained bitterly to their commanding officer and ended up saying ‘sod this’ and walking out — so I joined the police instead.”The psychology and French graduate’s first call of duty was with the Met in February .“Most of my career was spent as an investigator, and half of that in counter-terrorism, including nine years in the Met’s Special Branch” said Iain, who went to Aston University in Birmingham.“I did a lot of counter-terrorism operations during that time. I was initially posted to the Islamic Fundamentalist desk in , when no one really knew what Islamic fundamentalism was.“A lot of battle-hardened radical Islamic fundamentalists were coming back from war zones like Chechnya and Bosnia and there were a lot of Afghan veterans who had fought the Russians in Afghanistan.“We monitored that kind of activity and during that time [] there was a bomb at London’s Israeli Embassy.“I was involved in that investigation, where we successfully arrested and prosecuted people for that offence.”Iain revealed that he was initially “desperate to go on the Irish desk”, but “because it was around the time of the first Provisional IRA ceasefire, there wasn’t that much going on”.In , however, “when that ceasefire broke down, I joined the Irish Republican Terrorist team, which was also known as B Squad”.As an operational investigator with B Squad he “was involved in all the big mainland campaigns of the s”.“Operation Airlines was a PIRA attempt to blow up electricity substations around London, which would have brought down the national grid,” he said.“Another was Operation Tinnitus, which again resulted in the arrest of numerous members of that active service unit in London.“It was a very busy period for several years after the breakdown of the ceasefire and before the Good Friday Agreement.He moved into surveillance between  and , before moving out of London to join the force in the Midlands.“After   happened, everything switched literally overnight from Irish dissidents to Islamic extremism,” he said.Progressing up the ranks in Birmingham, he went back to being an investigator until .“I was running a child abuse investigation team,” he said, which was “harrowing and rewarding” work.“Our team also dealt with all sex offenders, domestic abuse and abuse against vulnerable adults, so we had quite a caseload.He added: “Emotionally, it took its toll. During that time I also went through a stressful, horrible separation and orce, so it was a really dark period of my le.“I was trying to manage all this stuff professionally while simultaneously going through that privately. Anyone who’s gone through a orce will know what it’s like it’s a bloody nightmare.”He ed to counter-terrorism in Birmingham, and then an opportunity came up to do a project for a year in the child abuse unit.His boss Peter Davis had just taken over from former RUC Special Branch chief Jim Gamble as head of CEOP, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in the UK.“I know Jim very well,” said Iain, who remarried.“I worked with Jim when he was in Special Branch. He was more senior than me, but in terms of our career path we followed a similar trajectory.”Iain, who has two sons and two daughters aged between nine and , has also worked with the PSNI child abuse team.“I spent a couple of days back in Northern Ireland, which was lovely I was also able to see my mum,” he said.Mum Mary, a former solicitor’s PA, in her mid-s, lives in Lisburn. His dad Tom, who worked for a le insurance company before he retired, passed away five years ago aged .Older brother Steveis a criminal barrister in London.Iain said that he did consider joining the RUC earlier in his police career but ultimately didn’t because his English we didn’t want to live in Northern Ireland.Although at first he had “no intention” of writing a book, he began putting his thoughts onto paper as a sort of therapy when he quit work.“I wanted my children to read it, understand the things I’ve done and to explain why I wasn’t around a lot of the time when they were growing up,” he said.“I periodically suffered from severe anxiety as a result of some of the jobs I was doing over the years, and the stress and pressure of that.“I thought it would be helpful for them to understand why I was a bit emotionally screwed up.”But Iain, who has been a voluntary chaplain in a local hospice for five years, soon realised there was “way more to this”.“I wanted to tell the story of how policing in England and Wales changed in  years, why that happened and then it was about trying to understand how policing has gone wrong — largely down to this Government,” he said.He added he was getting “massively positive feedback” about the boo. He also has a podcast of the same name.So what’s next for the energetic Northern Ireland man, who shows absolutely no sign of wanting to put his feet up and call it a day “Since retiring I’ve been working as an adviser to technology companies who build solutions for investigating crime, because that’s what I did in the last few years of my career,” he said.“But I really enjoy the writing.”Related topicsIRAMore On IRAJean McConville’s family raise funds to sue Sinn Fein PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionWe must remember our past for fear of repeating itNew IRA blamed for SDLP office bomb hoaxWidow of RUC constable killed in IRA attack in  appeals for ‘some kind of closure’ on anniversary of murder PremiumEyewitness Bloody Sunday: this is what happened, by the people who were thereMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayUDA boss Gary Fisher takes inner circle to Mexico to plot new drug routes into Northern IrelandRevealed: Ormeau Road bookies massacre gunman was Special Branch agentDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandNI house prices increase by .%, Halax survey finds‘Paedo-hunting gangs only want online fame’: NI man’s le ruined after being ly accused by fellow vigilantes‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaBelfast woman Emma Green jailed over £k fraud told to pay £k compoGive NI crisis the attention it deserves, DUP chief tells BorisLatestTrackside fire leaves rush-hour commuters stuck on trainsLyssa McGowan appointed next chief of Pets at HomeHead coach Andy Farrell ready for ‘test of all tests’ when Ireland visit ParisAustralia to open borders to vaccinated travellers on February Spoty CEO tells employees cancelling Joe Rogan ‘not the answer’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Ralph HewittTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHolyland residents have instructed a Belfast law firm to consider taking immediate legal action against the PSNI, the Department for Justice and the city council in an effort to stop anti-social behaviour in the area.Phoenix Law’s Darragh Mackin confirmed a number of residents in the south Belfast area are looking to “challenge the current regime in place”.The Holyland area has been plagued for years by anti-social behaviour from both young people and a minority of university students moving into the area.Almost  young people gathered for a street party during Freshers’ Week in September, resulting in three arrests and more than , bottles of alcohol being confiscated by police.The PSNI increased patrols in the Holyland during Freshers’ Week and St Patrick’s Day, handing out a number of Covid notices. But the problems continued to persist.Police were also investigating an incident in October where footage on social media appeared to show a group of iniduals throwing a plant pot at a resident’s car.Phoenix Law partner Mr Mackin stressed the potential legal action is aimed at protecting permanent residents in the area by ensuring safeguards are in place.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This is not a situation whereby it is residents against students as often inferred,” he told the Belfast . “In fact, it is the very opposite. The reality is the residents have been, and continue to be, let down by the ineffective practices and procedures in place to protect those iniduals who live in the area.“It is the worst kept secret that there continues to be illegal occupation of multiple person properties with little or no review or investigation.“Further, the area continues to produce high levels of anti-social behaviour with limited and intermittent policing response.”Mr Mackin added that residents have been left to fend for themselves “for too long”. “We are now instructed to consider immediate legal action against both the council, the department and the PSNI for failing to ensure the necessary protections and safeguards are in place for those residents who we represent,” he stated.Long-time residents’ campaigner Brid Ruddy, who is one of the Holyland residents involved in the case, welcomed the expected legal action. She agreed with Mr Mackin that the issues in the area are not “a tussle” between dfering lestyles of residents and students, but a failure by relevant agencies to put an end to noise complaints, fly-tipping, anti-social behaviour and houses of multiple occupancy .“Yes, a lot of the anti-social behaviour comes from a minority of students who are a disgrace to the student body, because not all students are like that, but the cause of it is the total failure by the agencies to really look after this area,” stated Ms Ruddy.“It has been left to degenerate into an HMO slum.”Reflecting on the trouble within the Holyland over the past year, Ms Ruddy said it never gets any better and now occurs seven days a week. She added that people go to the area to party because “they know there will be no repercussions” and said the “absurdity of it all” was highlighted when a communal Christmas tree installed by residents was stolen in early December.“The police and council just keep saying they’re working in partnership models with others,” said Ms Ruddy. “The partnership model doesn’t work. We can’t keep on doing the same thing and expecting a dferent result.”The PSNI, Belfast City Council and the Department for Justice all said they have not received any correspondence relating to legal proceedings.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandBelfast City CouncilDepartment of JusticeMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandHate crime rises in Northern Ireland with racist incidents showing biggest increasePolice seeking owner of horses found near Downe hospitalPSNI investigating Twitter troll after threat to rape Belfastjournalist’s daughter Murder victim was left in a wheelchair after gun attackGold jewellery stolen from Donaghadee businessMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayUDA boss Gary Fisher takes inner circle to Mexico to plot new drug routes into Northern IrelandRevealed: Ormeau Road bookies massacre gunman was Special Branch agentDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandNI house prices increase by .%, Halax survey finds‘Paedo-hunting gangs only want online fame’: NI man’s le ruined after being ly accused by fellow vigilantes‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaBelfast woman Emma Green jailed over £k fraud told to pay £k compoGive NI crisis the attention it deserves, DUP chief tells BorisLatestMacron heads to Moscow in bid to ease Ukraine tensionsInsulate Britain ‘just getting started’ with ‘even more ambitious’ campaign planTrackside fire leaves rush-hour commuters stuck on trainsLyssa McGowan appointed next chief of Pets at HomeHead coach Andy Farrell ready for ‘test of all tests’ when Ireland visit Paris,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Bernie BrownClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailOnly a few miles separate Tigers Bay and Clonard Monastery.In Northern Ireland historical terms, however, the two Belfast venues could hardly be further apart.One is a bastion of Ulster Protestantism, the other a citadel of northern Catholicism.But things are changing, and it was hard to escape the importance of the symbolism when Tigers Bay native Carl Frampton spoke at the west Belfast venue.The world champion boxer, emblematic of a more optimistic, post-conflict Northern Ireland, was a key speaker at the  Corners cross-community festival, the aim of which is to bring people together to focus on similarities rather than dferences.Others last week included the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Pope Francis — albeit via a video message — but Carl was more than happy to be there personally to address a large, wide audience and help the festival celebrate its th anniversary.It included former DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly and Belfast-born Northern Ireland Office minister Conor Burns — who heard Carl say he would be “too honest” to ever get involved in politics.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The  Corners was something I wanted to be involved in,” the two-weight title winner told the Belfast .“It’s good to do these sorts of things.“I feel like when you’ve been given a , you should try to use it to have a positive effect and that’s what I always try to do.”The -year-old, who describes himself as “more spiritual than religious”, added: “There was a large group of kids from east Belfast and where there a wide-ranging crowd, and something you might not have seen in a Catholic church too often in the past.“I’ve never done one in a Catholic church before, so it’s a new string to my bow.“It was a beautul setting as well.”Conservative MP Mr Burns —whose remark about Prime Minister Boris Johnson being “hijacked by a cake” became a global news story recently — was one of those who participated in the ‘Carl at Clonard’ question and answer session, hosted by broadcast journalist Mark Sidebottom.Mr Burns asked him what politicians can learn from sport, to which Carl replied: “I likened it to boxing. “I told him that what we see in politics at the minute is a lot of aggression.“There’s also a lot of anger between communities in Northern Ireland at the minute, and I don’t think politicians help that. I’ve seen it behind the scenes.The aggression that they’re showing is what people soak up, but behind the scenes it’s not like that.“They’re shaking hands and smiling at each other... behind the scenes, when the doors are closed, it’s not as aggressive as it comes across on the TV or in the newspapers when journalists are interviewing them.“In boxing, you can fight hard with someone for  rounds, blood, sweat and tears, but there’s an embrace at the end and respect shown and there doesn’t seem to be that respect in politicians at the minute.”He added: “Another thing I said, when I was askedI would ever go into politics — was that the answer is always no.“One of the reasons for that answer — and I’m not having a dig here — is that I feel like I’m too honest to be a politician.“I don’t feel clever enough to give a politician’s answer to questions — you see them being asked something and they just waffle on without actually answering it and they get away with it all the time.“I don’t think I would have the brain power to do that.”Carl said the Clonard session was emotional for him in parts.“At one point I was askedI ever cried outside of boxing and I said I cry a lot,” he added.“I actually cried that day because my we Christine’s cousin, who was younger than her, passed away.“I’d just had a video sent through that morning and it was hard to watch because it was upsetting.“There were pictures of her and her kids. It was heartbreaking to see a young girl lose her le, leaving two kids behind.“And I almost cried talking about it — I kind of held the tears back — but I got emotional, and I wasn’t expecting that.”Did the audience seem surprised to see a tough boxer cry “I think so, probably, but anybody close to me wouldn’t be surprised by me shedding a few tears, to be honest.”The  CornersFestival takes place annually around this time of year and comprises a range of events featuring discussion, music, prayer, drama, poetry and storytelling in venues across the city.A registered charity, it was set up a decade ago by Presbyterian minister Rev Steve Stockman and Catholic priest Fr Martin Magill.Related topicsCarl Frampton MBEBoris JohnsonMore On Carl Frampton MBE PremiumCarl FramptonOpinionI reckon Tyrone McKenna will be able to give Regis Prograis a real war in Dubai PremiumMark BainOpinionIntegrated education remains Rubik’s cube conundrum for NIEddie Hearn: Michael Conlan’s world title bid against Leigh Wood will produce fireworks and go down as a classic PremiumCarl FramptonOpinionKatie Taylor could be in line for a legacy-defining  PremiumCarl FramptonOpinionMichael Conlan leads my list of top  pound-for-pound Irish fighters as five Belfast boxers make the gradeMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayUDA boss Gary Fisher takes inner circle to Mexico to plot new drug routes into Northern IrelandRevealed: Ormeau Road bookies massacre gunman was Special Branch agentDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandNI house prices increase by .%, Halax survey finds‘Paedo-hunting gangs only want online fame’: NI man’s le ruined after being ly accused by fellow vigilantes‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaBelfast woman Emma Green jailed over £k fraud told to pay £k compoGive NI crisis the attention it deserves, DUP chief tells BorisLatest under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs making big waves in the world of businessTrackside fire leaves rush-hour commuters stuck on trainsLyssa McGowan appointed next chief of Pets at HomeHead coach Andy Farrell ready for ‘test of all tests’ when Ireland visit ParisAustralia to open borders to vaccinated travellers on February ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It did not comment when asked about how much of the £.m was intended for bank charges.Mr Lyons said the scheme had been a huge success, with .m cards dispatched, and spending using the cards had boosted the economy by £.m.Related topicsGordon LyonsDepartment for the EconomyUlster Unionist PartyAlan ChambersMore On Gordon Lyons PremiumViewpointOpinionWorking at home now a viable option PremiumPoliticians question Invest NI handing out £.m to fossil fuel extraction firmsDress to impress: ASOS seeks new NI tech recruitsStormont minister Lyons ‘confident’ over Boris Johnson’s pledge to replace EU fundingHigh Street scheme payments to , accounts ‘won’t have to be spent local’Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayUDA boss Gary Fisher takes inner circle to Mexico to plot new drug routes into Northern IrelandRevealed: Ormeau Road bookies massacre gunman was Special Branch agentDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandNI house prices increase by .%, Halax survey finds‘Paedo-hunting gangs only want online fame’: NI man’s le ruined after being ly accused by fellow vigilantes‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaBelfast woman Emma Green jailed over £k fraud told to pay £k compoGive NI crisis the attention it deserves, DUP chief tells BorisLatest under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs making big waves in the world of businessTrackside fire leaves rush-hour commuters stuck on trainsLyssa McGowan appointed next chief of Pets at HomeHead coach Andy Farrell ready for ‘test of all tests’ when Ireland visit ParisAustralia to open borders to vaccinated travellers on February ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A lot of people drive down and park on the beach. It was meant to be after high tide,” she said.“We have enough experience on that beach – you think we’d know better, but we walked up to go and get a coffee and the waves were coming right in, past the coffee area right at the top there.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “All the cars were getting completely swamped, there were a few animal baskets getting dragged away, luckily there were no animals in there, all animals were safe.“It was just crazy.“There were a group of ladies going in for a swim and a few of us were a bit concerned. We were saying ‘Be careful, maybe don’t go in or,you are, maybe don’t go too deep’. Then that surge came in, just before they went into the water, thank goodness, it would have been enough to take them off their feetthey had been in.”Anna said people need to be wary of strong currents.“The pull is so strong back out again,” she added.“That is why we have been putting up messages on social media for people to stay out of the water oryou are going into the water make sure you do an appropriate risk assessment and don’t go in far. I would just say don’t go in, to be honest.“When you first drive down you don’t think it is so bad but the waves out far are really big and they are breaking really big.“We drove round to Portstewart as well and because the waves are breaking so close to shore you can see the size of them.“I know the reports are that it is going to be building all day. Hopefully the surges won’t be coming up quite as far with the tide going out.”Locals said the surging waves can happen frequently.A spokesperson for Maritime and Coast Guard Control based in Bangor said further wave surges were expected into the afternoon yesterday, but the worst had passed.They encouraged the public not to put themselves into danger attempting to capture any photographs, never to turn their back on waves and to “stay high and stay dry”, by keeping away from dangerous and rough sea conditions.Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayUDA boss Gary Fisher takes inner circle to Mexico to plot new drug routes into Northern IrelandRevealed: Ormeau Road bookies massacre gunman was Special Branch agentDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandNI house prices increase by .%, Halax survey finds‘Paedo-hunting gangs only want online fame’: NI man’s le ruined after being ly accused by fellow vigilantes‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaBelfast woman Emma Green jailed over £k fraud told to pay £k compoGive NI crisis the attention it deserves, DUP chief tells BorisLatestNo  set for more changes as Boris Johnson tries to ease party fearsHealth Secretary describes Jimmy Carr’s Holocaust joke as ‘horrid’Macron heads to Moscow in bid to ease Ukraine tensionsInsulate Britain ‘just getting started’ with ‘even more ambitious’ campaign planTrackside fire leaves hundreds of rush-hour commuters stuck as  trains delayed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task.

Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point. Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Under Apartheid South Africa, the black majority did not have the right to vote. In Israel itself all citizens including its growing Arab population can vote, even for parties opposed to Zionism.

Israel maintains a free press that is often ferociouslycritical of successive governments’ behaviour towards the Palestinians.On the coast, activists run an underground network smuggling young gay Palestinians into cities like Tel Aviv, where they can be free. Meanwhile Palestinian governments continue a policy of separate development from their closest neighbour. Take the Covid pandemic, when Israeli scientists were among the first to develop vaccines to fight the virus. These vaccines were offered free of charge to the Palestinian Authority which opted for a Russian iety instead.And speaking of apartheid, anyone who has travelled in the Arab and Islamic world will note women are often second-class citizens. The maltreatment of religious minorities from the Gulf to Pakistan too could be described as a form of ethno-religious apartheid.Amnesty is entitled to criticise inidual policies of Israeli governments, but the slur of ‘apartheid’ is merely an enabler to those who want to destroy the Jewish state and its people.For more opinion pieces and letters, click here: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors. Interpreters such as Julie Doyle and Tony Evans can be seen on Welsh Government broadcasts, live with the First Minister and Health Minister, interpreting in BSL in real time in the room, and I pay tribute to them for the work they have done for the deaf community and in supporting this Bill.”.removeWhile we are thankfully now back at Level  Covid restrictions in Wales, it’s important we continue to keep up the effort on vaccinations and boosters – soyou haven’t had yours, please arrange to do so as soon as possible. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Looking at the issue more broadly, it’s critical thinking and open debate that powers real and necessary progress.”He said he was “deeply sorry” for the impact the controversy was having on Spoty’s workforce.Whether Spoty continues to keep Rogan or cuts ties, the decision likely will not sit well with one side or the other in an increasingly polarised America.On race, the choice is between keeping Rogan and sending a message that society has become too “woke”, or showing that Spoty is more attuned to a multiracial society, said Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociology professor at Washington University in St Louis. vw,vw,px, px\"Neil Young asked Spoty to remove his music from the  in protest over what he called the company’s decision to allow Covid- misinformation to spread on its service .remove“If Spoty says: ‘We can’t drop him. He has the right to say what he wants,’ that continues on the line where there is this implicit support to say racist things on these s,” she said in an interview before Mr Ek’s letter emerged.The streaming site also has to decide whether offensive words are allowable where on its app, where songs with racist, homophobic and anti-immigrant messages are available, said John Wihbey, a Northeastern University professor and specialist in emerging technologies.“There’s some real self-examination to be doing beyond Joe,” Mr Wihbey said.“This is a big moment of reckoning for entertainment and streaming s to see where the window is, what’s over the line.”Rogan’s public troubles started on January  when musician Neil Young asked to have his music removed because of concerns that Rogan was promoting scepticism about the Covid- vaccines. Other artists followed suit, including Joni Mitchell and Roxane Gay.The scrutiny only intensied when a video compilation emerged last week showing Rogan repeatedly using racial slurs. Grammy-winning artist India.Arie posted it on her Instagram, using the hashtag #DeleteSpoty.Spoty said previously that it would soon add a warning to all podcasts that discuss Covid-, directing listeners to factual, up-to-date information from scientists and public health experts. vw,vw,px, px\"Joni Mitchell also moved to take her music off the  in solidarity with Neil Young “They take this money that’s built from streaming, and they pay this guy  million dollars, but they pay us like .% of a penny,” Arie wrote. “I don’t want to generate money that pays that.”Rogan apologised on Saturday, saying that the slurs were the “most regretful and shameful thing” he has ever had to address, and that he has not used the N-word in years.Mr Ek told The Wall Street Journal last week that he took responsibility for being “too slow to respond” to the criticism over vaccine misinformation. It took the company five days to respond publicly to Young.“It’s become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely accepted information from the medical and scientic communities guiding us through this unprecedented time,” Mr Ek continued in a statement.Rogan is an odd mix of shock-jock and host who leads discussions of public policy, arts and culture, Mr Wihbey said, describing his brand as conservative “bro America”.His comments were clearly racist, Mr Wihbey said, but he hopes that Rogan will see this as a chance to substantively discuss race and vaccine issues in future episodes – otherwise his audience may not hear the discussions..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Spoty CEO tells employees cancelling Joe Rogan  unot the answer u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The novel was published anonymously, but the author was later identied as Daniel Defoe, who had already leapt to fame as the author of ‘Robinson Crusoe’.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Defoe, a strong supporter of the English Reformation lies buried in the celebrated Bunhill Fields, close to other celebrated Dissenters such as John Bunyan and John Owen.Rev David ClarkeFilm makers enjoy the novel’s rumbustious story-lines, but Defoe intended the novel as a moral tale. Early in the unfolding story the narrator remarks that ‘the devil is an unwearied tempter’.Mention of the devil induces scorn in our day. C.S. Lewis once wrote that ‘there are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased with both errors’.The name Satan is a Hebrew word which originally meant ‘adversary’, like a prosecuting lawyer pointing out our misdeeds but eventually came to suggest someone enticing us to evil.Defoe’s heroine remarked that temptation comes persistently, for he is an unwearied tempter. The New Testament records how in his early ministry Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness facing temptation. When those were successfully overcome, we read that the devil departed from him ‘for a season’. The tempter always comes back. Victory is never final while we have breath. We need constantly to be on our guard.Temptation often comes unexpectedly. A famous scholar recorded how he had once addressed a Christian conference at Swanwick Conference Centre in Derbyshire and was elated by the experience, yet within a few hours ‘the devil and all his angels met him on the  of Derby Midland Station’. I wonder what human form he assumed  Shakespeare’s Macbeth was ing from the battlefield, full of confidence when he met the three witches, who planted in his mind the idea that he might be king. The temptation to murder King Duncan came, he said, ‘in the day of my success’. We can never predict when the onslaught may come.Temptation also comes attractively. Satan can transform himself into an angel of light . In the tale of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve are told of the benefits they will reap in eating the forbidden fruit, but not of the penalties. Temptation focusses on the momentary thrill and satisfaction, never on the subsequent guilt, shame and pay-back. The focus is never on the alcoholic’s ward, the orce court or the prison cell.The advice of Peter is worth heeding: ‘Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour’ .Read More Read MoreBe careful of the stones you throw  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularMan arrested after hijacking in Ballyclare...NewsWarning as police catch two M R drivers at speeds of more t...NewsWarning from Lisburn police...NewsTribute to Portadown woman Florence Hunnord - a we and m...NewsCarrickfergus criminal damage spate: signicant number of v...NewsMost PopularBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from bir...RecommendedHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router ext...RecommendedEmma takes on Hospice Support Group role...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
