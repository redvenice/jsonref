It’s a YORKSHIRE PUDDING, don’t even think of calling it anything else, especially in Yorkshire. I am spitting feathers right now.’And suggesting it could eaten ‘for breakfast, lunch and dessert any time of year’ and served ‘with syrup, preserves, confectioners’ sugar or cinnamon sugar,’ was probably all too much for some online pudding fans.Becky wrote: ‘This is not a dessert! This is a thing of beauty that should be filled with beef and vegetables. Or sausage and mash. It is a Yorkshire pudding.’A batter of eggs, flour and milk, cooked in the oven for around 30 minutes – yeah, it’s a Yorkshire pudding in all but name, mate – despite how much icing sugar and jam you eat it with.Although I personally wouldn’t recommend that serving suggestion.MORE: Meghan Markle’s father ‘will miss wedding due to heart surgery’MORE: UK sees first drop of EU workers in eight years following Brexit vote"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/sei_1226507.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"intermittent fasting cramming food eight hour window key easy fat loss","story":"The saying goes that ‘breakfast is the most important meal of the day’.Tell any PT or fitness instructor that you want to lose weight and they’ll tell you to first make sure that you’re starting the day with a decent meal.Or at least…they used to.More and more fitness folk seem to be jumping on the intermittent fasting bandwagon, claiming that it’s revolutionary in reducing their weight and fat percentage, maintaining lean muscle mass and in making them more productive.But what does it involve and just how practical is it to do?All the term means is going without food for a period of time. Most us fast through the night – that’s why our first meal is called break-fast. Intermittent fasting tends to extend the period of time that we’re not eating to upwards of 12 hours.Some people go for 14 hours between eating, others go longer. And some people do it every day while others use it as a kind of weekly reset. An old friend of my mum’s, for example, spent 30 years never eating on a Monday. He’d have his last meal on Sunday evening and his next on Tuesday morning.For the most part, it involves dining earlier and breakfasting later. You set aside an eight-hour window in which you can eat what you want (within reason), or to reach your daily calorie intake, and then that’s it. You might have breakfast at 10am, your lunch at 1pm and your dinner at 6pm – and then not eat anything else untli 10am the next day.If you’re eating relatively healthy balanced meals, you should find that during those eight hours, you don’t really get hungry. Most of us snack for about 14 hours a day – and we wonder we’re not seeing the returns we should be from our exercise regimes. This concept allows you to snack within limits.Liam, 34, is a PT who has been intermittently fasting for the past year. In periods when he wasn’t working, he often went for up to 32 hours without a meal – eating only after smashing out weights in the gym today, he only fasts four days a week – although the fasting window is about 23 hours.‘I fast from 8pm the night before until about 5 or 6pm but I don’t fast on gym days,’ he tells .A low-effort way of making gains and maintaining weight (Picture: Ella Byworth for )His fasting days tend to amount to 1,400 calories and he ups that to around 2,800 calories on normal eating days. He claims to have made significant progress in his training and says that fasting allows him to concentrate on other things.‘If I know I’m not going to be eating, I don’t have to spend time shoppingcookingeating,’ he explains.‘I just get on with other stuff – going out or working. It makes you way more efficient with your time and I find it much easier to concentrate on a more empty stomach.’Now that sounds fair enough if you’re one of the lucky people who eat to live, rather than lives to eat. For many of us, however, food is something we love and look forward to – it’s the reason we train hard. So that’s when the 16:8 rule comes in – sticking to that eight-hour window and prioritising when you want to eat means that you can benefit from fasting without really denying yourself. As long as you try to eat healthily for most of the time, you should be able to have your cake and eat it.It’s supposed to be an easy and effective way of getting lean without having to go on a diet. You’re not restricting calories, you’re not embarking on any stupid fat-free, carb-free, sugar-free plan. You’re eating normally, just in a shorter period of time. And because you’er not depriving your body of nutritents, it’s supposed to be a really good way of maintaining muscle mass while getting lean (which is oten hard to balance).Like most things, it might seem like a new wellness fad but intermittent fasting has been around for centuries (Pythagoras was a fan).Remember the 5:2 diet (eating 500 calories twice a week and your normal calorie allowance five days week)? That was a type of intermittent fasting. But this timed approach sounds both easier and less miserable than its predecessor.Intermittent fasting is supposed to help make the body more efficient in how it burns and uses fuel, rather than forcing it to lose weight.When you eat a meal, your body spends a few hours processing the food, taking and absorbing nutrients and working out what it can use. Because of all the readily available fuel you’ve provided it with, your body will choose to burn food as energy, rather than stored fat. And that’s epceially true when you eat carbohydrates and sugars they’re readily available and easy to turn into glycogen.If you struggle with snacking, this might help (Picture: Ella Byworth for )Turning fat into fuel (ketosis) takes a little more effort and means that you’re forcing the body to become more efficient in fat burning the result (if you don’t go overboard in what you choose to eat) should be a reduction in body fat and a maintenance (and perhaps even an increase) in lean muscle.It takes up to about five hours for the body to finish absorbing and digesting and after that period, your body goes into a ‘post-absorptive state’, which lasts up to 12 hours after your meal. That’s when you enter a fasted state – and it’s then that your body finds it easier to burn fat because your insuline levels are low.Most of us never really reach that fasted state. Our culture has increasingly become one of eating regularly so we never really get hungry and we never really recover from digesting and aborbing. Perhaps that’s one of the reasons so many of us struggle with poor gut health – we never give our digestive systems a break.Aside from the benefits, intermittent fasters often claim that their lives are simplier as a result of following suhc a pattern. Wake up, grab a glass of water or coffee and you’re good to go until mid morning or lunchtime. There’s less cooking, less planning and as a result, more time to do other stuff.Back in 1946, scientists discovered that intermittent fasting extended the life of mice. More recently, Harvard researchers concluded that fasting can aincrease life, slow aging and improve overall health by altering hte activity of our cells.They found that fasting can manipulate our mitochondrial networks (they’re the tiny power plants inside our cells) to keep them in a youthful state. Our networks tend to alternate between being fused and fragmented the Harvardstudy found that fasting can promote homeostatis (being in a regular state) in these networks, allowing for a healthy plasticity between the fused and fragmented states.Senior author on the study, William Mair, said: ‘Our work shows how crucial the plasticity of mitochondria networks is for the benefits of fasting,’ the study said.‘If we lock mitochondria in one state, we completely block the effects of fasting or dietary restriction on longevity.’Of course, longevity is down to a whole host of factors, but anything’s worth a shot.‘Going without food for 14 hours can help as in the longer term it may help the way that cells respond to glucose and insulin, and also help lower blood pressure,’ Nutrition consultant and founder of #nutribollocks, Ian Marber, tells .If you have disordered eating or think you might struggle mentally with any form of restrictive eating, you may want to give intermittent fasting a pass.There’s also your social life to think of. If you tend to socialise around food, think about how you’ll navigate those events. Perhaps you only want to fast a couple of days a week when you know that you won’t have any supper parties or events to go to. Perhaps it’s a case of revolutionising how you socialise – swapping meals for activities, for example.Set your hoursIt’s no good deciding that you’re going to go for 23 hours in between each feed if you’ve never done it before. Start small and see how you get on.A good place to start would be to stop eating at 8pm and resume eating at 10am (giving you a 10 hour eating period) and then scale that back to 7pm and 11am (that golden eight-hour window). And if you want to eat a little more during the window, then go back even further and miss morning munch altogether and eat between noon and 7pm.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )Decide on your calorie intake and your cheat daysSo unlike the dreaded 5:2, this kind of fasting works on the principal that you keep your calories basically the same. For most of us, we’d probably be looking to stick with our maintenance calories – but if calorie counting isn’t for you, just eat as you normally would.To ensure that you actually stick with it, plan a day when you’re going to eat what and when you want to. It might be every Saturday (who’d want to miss out on brunch?), or it could be all weekend. Whenever it is, use that as your time for having late dinners and early breakfasts.Work out what you want to get out of itIs it just that you want to streamline your life, or do you want to lose body fat without obsessing over calories and scales? Whatever it is, concentrate on that and you should be able to make it through those sneaky 9pm munchies.Anyone fancy a Branston Pickle doughnut for National Doughnut Week?If you tend to get home from work late, think about meal prepping. Rather than taking your breakfast into work, how about taking in your dinner instead? That way you’re not rushing home to cook and eat in your assigned window.Where does your exercise fit in?Since fasting, Liam tells us that he’s has reduced the number of days he spends in the gym and that’s not uncommon. People often report that they find themselves needing to work out for less time to see the same results. Fasted cardio is supposed to be the thing for fat loss so if that’s your goal, see if you can runcycle to work or gym before your fast ends. If you find that you’re struggling due to low blood sugar, then workout after you’ve eaten your first meal and see if over time that changes.As we’ve said, people have intermittently fasted for donkey’s years. Ramadan is essentially an inverted intermittent fast (with believers fasting during the day rather than overnight). It’s not dangerous when you’re doing it sensibly.Just make sure that you already have a healthy relationship with food before you start messing around with it if you have a tendency to worry about dieting or calories, do not attempt to fast.Fasting could become a problem if you start to obsess over what you’re going to eat and keep increasing the fasting window. Sure, some yogis can go for three days without eating but if you’re pushing the physical boundaries in a bid to lose weight, then you may need to seek advice or help.Make sure that you really do get your full fill of food during your eating window – and if you’re struggling to eat when you do have the opportunity or you find yourself making that window increasingly smaller, contact somewhere like Beat, who can help.Over the next month, I’m going to be giving intermittent fasting a go to see just how easy and effective it really is.

He was ready to step up because the first 25 minutes were really tough.‘They played really well and we were under a bit of pressure.‘But then he got an assist with an excellent corner and he could have had another two or three with the quality of his passing.’One of the biggest conundrums facing Arteta should he be appointed concerns Aaron Ramsey’s future.Arsenal, yet again, find themselves in a scenario whereby one of their most important and influential players is left with just 12 months remaining on his contract.Ramsey has just enjoyed one of his best campaigns in an Arsenal shirt and was rewarded with the captain’s armband in Wenger’s final game.Were it not for his delicate contractual situation, the 27-year-old would represent a natural successor to Laurent Koscielny, whose days as a top class centre-half appear numbered after his Achilles’ gave up on him against Atletico Madrid.Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta were in Arsenal’s midfield together in the 2014 FA Cup final win over Hull (Picture: Getty)Reports claim Arsenal are minded to sell Ramsey, rather than allow him to run down his current deal, but losing a player of the Welshman’s quality would surely represent an early blow, given how highly Arteta rates his former midfield partner and the lack of funds he would have available to replace him.‘A player like this coming from midfield to score that many goals gives you something extra,’ Arteta noted after Ramsey scored a last minute opening day winner against Crystal Palace back in August 2015.‘He reminds me a bit of Fabregas when he was here. At his best, Fabregas was coming off the front, making the final ball and scoring very important goals.Aaron Ramsey’s current contract expires in the summer of 2019 (Picture: Getty)‘I think he will get better with experience and confidence. People fear him now because they know he can create things and that gives you an extra yard, which is very important.‘We don’t have someone to score 30 or 40 goals so players who can score from the middle is very important.’Arsenal’s measly warchest totals just £50million after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the second year in succession, according to reports.Those transfer funds could well be boosted by the sales of several high-profile first team players and Bellerin, perhaps, represents the most expendable given his value allied to the lack of significant progress he has made in recent years.The 23-year-old, who signed a long-term contract in October 2016, has nailed his colours to Arsenal’s mast in the last week, twice giving interviews in which he described London as his home.Hector Bellerin made his Arsenal debut, coming on a substitute for Mikel Arteta against West Brom in September 2013 (Picture: Getty)Despite his public pledge of loyalty, Manchester United and Juventus, as well as his former club Barcelona, continue to monitor his situation carefully. Given he claims to have predicted Bellerin’s rapid rise, Arteta will no doubt hope to keep hold of his compatriot.‘I’ve been really impressed with Hector since he came into the first team – perhaps even more with his attitude than his quality, because I knew all about that,’ Arteta said during Bellerin’s breakthrough 201415 season.‘He has the attributes to become one of the club’s most important players. He is very brave, his decision making is good and he’s a great athlete. He is very open, he is willing to understand what the manager and the team want from him on the pitch and his attitude and contribution have been really good.’Petr Ceh joined Arsenal from Chelsea in the summer of 2015 (Picture: Getty)Petr Cech has come nowhere close to fulfilling the prediction of John Terry, who claimed his former teammate would save his new team between 12 and 15 points a season, and will, in all likelihood, lose his position as Arsenal’s No.1 next season.Time has rapidly caught up with Cech’s battle-weary body and though his experience may well prove to be a useful asset, it is no surprise to see Arsenal being heavily linked with Bayer star Bernd Leno.Arteta faces a relatively straightforward task in demoting his former teammate, but the comments he made upon the veteran joining Arsenal are particularly telling.Bernd Leno has been heavily linked with a summer move to Arsenal (Picture: EPA)Cech’s hunger and bravery, clearly curried favour with Arteta, who clearly recognises the impact sound transfer business can have on a club as a whole.‘His ambition is coming out even though he has won everything in England and in Europe,’ said Arteta, almost two years ago.‘These type of signings give a lift to the whole team. He’s not just a good goalkeeper, he has experience, ambition.‘The decision he made to come here after being a legend at Chelsea is not easy. I don’t think many of them would do it at his age. He is still hungry and he wants to prove himself at the top again and it’s really good decision for us.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/this-time-next-year-main-baby-3.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"time next year viewers tears woman becomes pregnant told couldnt children","story":"Baishali, Steve and Becky on This Time Next Year (Picture: ITV)This Time Next Year ended the series on a suitably emotional note, seeing a woman become pregnant after being told she couldn’t have children.Couple Steve and Baishali appeared on the ITV show with Becky, who they were hoping would carry their baby after Baishali suffered a miscarriage which resulted in severe scarring of the uterus following surgery.She was told by doctors she couldn’t carry a child after her uterus was ’90 per cent obliterated’, but shocked viewers following the year transformation on the show.Instead of walking through the studio doors, host Davina McCall revealed how the couple couldn’t appear on the show, leaving the pair to explain via video-link.Baishali said: ‘I’m really sorry we couldn’t be there today.

The friend says Cook and Dexter had been \u0027texting each other for days\u0027 before he invited her over to his home. Moore says that when they went back to Cook\u0027s house all he wanted to do was \u0027have sex\u0027           The friend revealed that Dexter (pictured with Cook in his home) was unhappy about Cook\u0027s claim that the encounter never happened           This is Cook\u0027s $2.2million waterfront property where the two spent five days together \u0027Peter flew her to LaGuardia (airport) on Thursday and she spent the first night at a friend\u0027s house in East Hampton then on Friday Peter came and met her at The American Hotel.\u0027When Peter arrived, Kasey immediately thought he was hot. He obviously felt the same because she had sent him a lot of sexy pictures so there was definitely chemistry.\u0027Moore says that when they went back to Cook\u0027s house all he wanted to do was \u0027have sex\u0027.\u0027She said he wasn\u0027t a bad guy like she had heard, in fact she really liked him,\u0027 she said.Share this article\u0027He took her for manicures and pedicures and they went to the movie \u0027I Feel Pretty\u0027 with Amy Schumer. They actually had fun together, so it was really hurtful to her when he denied they even were together.\u0027They really got to know each other. Every night they watched old classic movies and he made her latte\u0027s in the morning and brought them to bed.\u0027It seems ridiculous that he would deny it. It\u0027s wrong for him to be embarrassed since he flew her there and she is beautiful and they spent so many days together.\u0027           Cook, who was married to supermodel Christie Brinkley for 12 years, is said to have a \u0027secret pathological predilection\u0027 for younger women.

The two ended their relationship earlier this year Moore claims Cook even bought Dexter a new cell phone, on which many of the photos obtained by DailyMail.com were taken.\u0027That\u0027s another reason why he can\u0027t deny they had an \u0027encounter\u0027 as he referred to it,\u0027 said Moore.\u0027It seems like Peter still wants to be with her because he keeps texting her.\u0027But she might be done with him because he is acting ridiculous about their relationship being public.

She later sent a text saying she loved him and was concerned about his health, and it seemed as though her reaching out had indeed convinced him to attend after all.\u0027I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle,\u0027 Thomas said on Tuesday.\u0027Of course I\u0027d walk her down the aisle.

It was Doria’s decision to leave,\u0027 a source told the outlet. \u0027She has talked about starting her own private practice, focusing on working with elderly patients.\u0027 The reports about Doria\u0027s decision to quit her job come just one week after it was revealed that she had met with TV legend Oprah Winfrey at her $88 million Los Angeles home in order to discuss ideas for a tell-all interview. According to the Mirror Online, the duo spent six hours together going over potential topics that could be covered during a sit-down, with a source saying that they focused particularly on race and the role that it has played in Harry and Meghan\u0027s relationship.  \u0027Oprah and Doria spent a long time chatting and they got on really well,\u0027 the source said.          Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, has once again pulled out of his daughter\u0027s big day, revealing that he needs to have major heart surgery on Wednesday morning          The surgery seems to be the final end to speculation surrounding Thomas\u0027 attendance          Extended family: Meghan\u0027s nephews Tyler (R) and Thomas Dooley and their mother, Tracy Dooley (L), are in London for the wedding but they aren\u0027t thought to be attending the ceremony          \u0027What a journey so far!\u0027 Shortly after arriving in London, Tyler began sharing images of the trip on his Facebook page\u0027The most important and significant issue they spoke about was race and how badly some people had reacted to Meghan and Harry. \u0027What happened to Meghan and Harry was disgusting and they and all of their families were horrified. It’s an issue close to both Doria and Oprah, who have both suffered racism.\u0027 However, the interview reportedly needs to be approved by Meghan, Harry, and Buckingham Palace before it is recorded. Growing up, Meghan lived with her mother in a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in the Mid-Wilshire area of Los Angeles.  The Suits star\u0027s mother, Doria, and her father, Thomas, orced when she was six years old.Although Doria is thought to be the only close relative attending the royal wedding, members of Meghan\u0027s extended family are in town for Saturday\u0027s celebration. The former actress\u0027 nephews Tyler and Thomas Dooley and their mother, Meghan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracy Dooley, seem determined to take part in the big day.Despite previously revealing they hadn\u0027t received an invite to the royal wedding, the trio were seen making their way to the arrivals gate at the London airport on Monday with 13 suitcases.  The family have been enlisted as \u0027special correspondents\u0027 for Good Morning Britain and are expected to report from Windsor, though are thought not to be attending the ceremony.Meghan Markle\u0027s Father is Not Going to the Royal Wedding, Suffered Heart Attack | TMZ.comMeghan Markle on the 10 Women Who Changed Her Life | GlamourMeghan Markle\u0027s mum to reveal vile racial abuse suffered by family since daughter\u0027s engagement to Prince Harry - Mirror OnlineMeghan Markle\u0027s Dad Thomas to Undergo Heart Surgery and Can\u0027t Attend Wedding | TMZ.com"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/22/17/497CBE1100000578-5422621-image-a-40_1519320144076.jpg","title":"Superman star Margot Kidder unresponsive couch friend","story":"Margot Kidder was found unresponsive on her couch by a friend on Sunday who had stopped by her house in Montana to help with cleaning, it has been reported.

I managed to grab his wrist and take the knife from him. I had to explain: \u0027Once you\u0027re dead, you don\u0027t come back. You\u0027re not invincible.\u0027But Riley is only just beginning to grasp the fact that actions have consequences and recognise the effects of his reckless behaviour.When Shelley caught him holding a lit match to the safety netting of their trampoline — with all four children sitting inside it — she showed him graphic pictures of burn victims.  Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strengthShelley says: \u0027I had to try to get him to understand the danger of fire, to show him exactly what would happen to him and his brother and sisters if he started fires.\u0027Shelley\u0027s partner Max adds: \u0027We adopt shock tactics. All the children have fallen down stairs because he has chased or pushed them. We\u0027re constantly rationalising: \u0027If you do that, they could break an arm, a leg, their neck. They could be killed.\u0027 \u0027Shelley and Max are also parents to Brooke, six, Skyla, four, and 20-month-old Mikey, who suffers from a reflux disorder, is fed through a tube and often spends time in hospital. The demands on the adults\u0027 time and attention are ceaseless.Riley, however, is not a monster — though he does behave monstrously at times — and he is not wilfully delinquent. For his behaviour is the result of the autism with which he was diagnosed a year ago.It accounts for his boisterousness, his attention-seeking, his outbursts of violence and frequent meltdowns. He also has a raft of other labels and conditions, from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to learning difficulties and oppositional defiant disorder (hostile, defiant and disobedient behaviour).Another condition, called sensory processing disorder, means that Riley\u0027s brain has difficulty responding to information that comes through his senses.\u0027He will cry if the seams of his socks aren\u0027t aligned properly,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, we can go through five pairs that don\u0027t feel right before he\u0027s happy to wear them.\u0027But he can also be sweet-natured and protective, kind and endearing.  Then and now: Riley has been a handful for his Hertfordshire parents but he knows he is different and already worries about his future\u0027He is a mass of contradictions,\u0027 says his mum. \u0027He\u0027ll be the first to climb on the shed roof or to the top of a tree. Once, he broke his collarbone falling off a wardrobe. He\u0027d climbed up it to get a pack of cards.\u0027He doesn\u0027t feel pain, either. The next day, with his arm in a sling, he was scaling the kitchen units.\u0027But, in some ways, he\u0027s mature about safety. He panics and is over-protective of his siblings. He worries that the girls might be bullied — he focuses on it obsessively.\u0027If we go to the station, he\u0027ll say: \u0027Hold the pushchair in case it gets sucked under a train.\u0027\u0027If I go above level one in the car park, he\u0027ll have a meltdown. He hates glass lifts, the noise of hand-dryers, and roller coasters.\u0027          Shelley has had to quit work to look after her son with autism. Now, they hope they can get a dog for him which will guide him through lifeMax adds: \u0027Yet he thinks he can fly and leap across ravines. And, although he throws punches at his sisters and kicks them in the face, he can also be caring.\u0027When Mikey had to go into hospital, he stroked his head so gently. He was crying. One to one, he can be the most wonderful, comical little boy.\u0027He has multiple personalities. Sometimes, he demands our constant, unided attention. At others, he retreats to his bedroom and wants to be alone.\u0027Woman takes fight to court as doctors try to remove autistic...Boy, 11, who was suspended for \u0027tapping his pen\u0027 hasn\u0027t been...Share this articleThe family\u0027s warm, but chaotic, home near St Albans, Hertfordshire, bears evidence of Riley\u0027s volatility. Doors have been removed as he has kicked holes through them. A sardonic sign in the sitting room reads: \u0027Remember: as far as anyone knows we are a nice, normal family.\u0027The Riley I meet bursts into the room after school, sweet-faced and charming, fizzing with energy and eager to chat about his day, from the roast lunch he ate in its entirety (\u0027except the fat bits on the meat\u0027) to the sponge pudding he didn\u0027t finish because he wanted to rush out and play with his friends.          Riley has kicked holes in doors and threatened to throw knives-  but his mum says he is not a monster as he tries to understand his conditionThere is little to distinguish him from other boys his age — his gelled hair and cheeky grin signal mischief — except that he wears the collar of his polo shirt tucked inside to stop his obsessive habit of chewing it and he grasps a small American football as if it were a priceless treasure. The ball is carried everywhere — he even takes it into the bath and to bed.This compulsive attachment to one object was an early indication to Shelley that Riley had traits that set him apart. As she works with young children, she was alert to his differences. At first, she remembers, he seemed precociously advanced.\u0027We\u0027d go somewhere and he\u0027d remember how to get back there from that single visit,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027And he spoke in complete sentences from 18 months. He was good at problem-solving, too: if he wanted to reach something, he\u0027d build a tower and climb up it.\u0027He was also endlessly, exhaustingly, active: somersaulting off the sofa or hanging off it upside down while watching his favourite wildlife programmes on television. He would absorb information like a sponge, constantly reciting facts.Shelley\u0027s relationship with Riley\u0027s father broke down when he was a baby but, when he was 16 months old, she met pub manager Max, who has raised her son with the same love and care he gives their other three children.          Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strength. Pictured with Brooke age 6, Skyla age 4 and Mikey (20 months)Yet Riley\u0027s behaviour continued to tax and baffle them. It was, Shelley says, a \u0027supreme relief\u0027 when he was diagnosed, aged seven, with autism.It meant there was a reason for his quirks, his flare-ups, his failure to make eye contact and his adherence to ritual. Importantly, there were also ways to help him.But, although he now takes anti-psychotic medication, there are still times when Riley tries his parents\u0027 patience to its limits.One day, Max caught Riley with his hands round Brooke\u0027s neck. \u0027They were arguing because she\u0027d gone into his bedroom — his sanctuary — and Riley had grabbed her round the throat,\u0027 says Max.\u0027I was so angry and scared that I shouted to Shelley: \u0027Keep your son away from my children.\u0027 It\u0027s the first and only time I\u0027ve said it — I make a huge effort not to treat Riley differently from the others and, in my heart, he\u0027s my son — but I felt he\u0027d crossed a boundary and that Shelley wasn\u0027t doing enough to discipline him.\u0027However, conventional forms of chastisement do not work with Riley. He doesn\u0027t respond to sanctions, restraint or withdrawal of privileges.  Shelley with Mikey (20 months) and daughters Brooke age six, Skyla age four, as well as son Riley, aged eightThe pressures on the family are immense and relentless. For the past 18 months, neither Shelley nor Max has worked, as it is a full-time job for both of them to look after the children.\u0027I don\u0027t like Riley sometimes, but I never stop loving him,\u0027 says Shelley. And she fears for him, too. Her elder son is heart-breakingly self-aware, acutely conscious that his brain is differently wired from most people\u0027s — and it causes him intense pain.\u0027It makes me so sad,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, he\u0027ll say: \u0027I\u0027m an ugly, stupid boy,\u0027 and punch himself in the face and not seem to feel it.\u0027He gets upset about his behaviour and sobs. He says: \u0027Why do I have to have a brain like this?\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve always told him he has a \u0027special\u0027 brain. We\u0027ve built a story round it and told him not to be so hard on himself. We\u0027ve explained that he isn\u0027t \u0027bad\u0027. His brain just works differently.\u0027But Shelley worries about his future. Although he attends a mainstream junior school now, she knows he will need to go to a secondary school that caters for his special needs. What will happen in the future?She says: \u0027I have really down days sometimes, thinking: \u0027Is he going to cope? Where is his life leading?

When Shelley\u0027s sister, Jade, brought her border collie, Keiko, to stay with the family for a week, Riley was thrilled to be entrusted with the task of caring for the dog.\u0027His job was to get Keiko\u0027s food and water and he loved the procedure, the routine and the responsibility,\u0027 recalls Shelley.\u0027He precisely weighed out the food and he liked the fact that the dog gave him full-on attention.\u0027She loves chasing a ball — she never tires of it — and Riley spent hours outside throwing the ball for her to catch. He loved that she\u0027d sit when he asked her to and give him her paw. She slept on the floor in his bedroom and, all week, he didn\u0027t have a meltdown. It was as if the whole house gave a sigh of relief.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s what Riley needs. A dog,\u0027 Shelley said to Max after Keiko had gone back home.So she searched the internet and discovered Autism Life Dogs, a charity providing specially trained dogs for autistic people.          Shelley wants to try and raise enough money to buy a companion dog for her son who cries about being different to the other childrenSuch a dog costs £8,500, beyond the slender means of the family, so they are raising money for one.The dogs sense anxiety, hesitation, fear — all possible precursors to a meltdown — and signal before it happens. They are also wonderful companions.At present, Shelley and Max dare not let Riley out of their sight. \u0027He would run into the road chasing a ball without thinking about the traffic,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027And he wouldn\u0027t realise the danger of getting into a car with a stranger.\u0027With a dog at his side, however, he could take the first small steps towards independence. \u0027A dog wouldn\u0027t just change Riley\u0027s life,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027It could save it, too.\u0027 Shelley\u0027s JustGiving page can be found here.Crowdfunding to Fund an Autism Life Dog for my son.

The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday there had been ‘little progress’ since March. The new document, which ministers hope to publish before the next Brussels summit at the end of June, will also try to tackle the vexed issue of future customs arrangements, which has split the Cabinet.Members of Mrs May’s Brexit ‘war Cabinet’ again failed to resolve the customs issue during a 90-minute meeting yesterday.More than a quarter of shops are selling knives illegally to...Bullying, catfights and fraudulent entries: Inside the...Share this articleMr Davis and Mrs May’s deputy David Lidington gave brief presentations on work to tackle problems with the Government’s two customs options. But sources said the two sides in the debate were ‘no nearer’ to reaching agreement.Instead, ministers spent much of the meeting discussing arrangements for the Irish border if neither of the Government’s two customs options succeeds.Eurosceptic MPs yesterday urged Mrs May to ‘face down’ Brussels and Dublin over its demand that Northern Ireland effectively remain within the customs union in order to prevent the creation of a so-called ‘hard border’.

It comes amid a row over the role of grammars in Britain’s educational landscape.Mr Heller-Sahlgren said that although his study did not examine the effects of selective schools – many of which are academies – they were likely to add to the phenomenon he had described. ‘One could make the argument that it increases choice and competition in the same way,’ he said.‘If grammar schools promote more choice and competition, you could argue in a roundabout way that the results might be relevant for that as well.’The study, which was based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was published in the Economics of Education Review.          Tee study said the positive effects on academic achievement appear to outweigh the negative impacts on pupil wellbeing (file picture)The findings are a boost for Conservative education policies. Since coming to power, the party has been encouraging all schools to leave council control – and failing schools have been forced to do so.Last week it emerged that thousands more places are to be created at selective schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has approved a £50million fund to build extra classrooms. However, grammars bidding for the money must be able to prove that they are taking action to increase admissions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.It is thought that between 1,000 and 2,000 places could be created in areas where there is high demand from parents.The Department for Education said the move would give parents more choice and give more children of all backgrounds access to a good school place.But union leaders said ministers had no evidence that ‘shows strong educational benefit of this misguided policy’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/02/4C44AC5800000578-5734013-image-a-2_1526433058218.jpg","title":"Nature works magic time year wisteria blooms make purple envy","story":"    The climbing plant was already mature when the owners moved into the house near Wells, Somerset, 35 years ago          Wisteria growing on the Castle Hotel in Taunton, SomersetBut now the entire property is drenched in purple splendour, with this year’s display even more stunning than usual.

She later sent a text saying she loved him and was concerned about his health, and it seemed as though her reaching out had indeed convinced him to attend after all.\u0027I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle,\u0027 Thomas said on Tuesday.\u0027Of course I\u0027d walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. I\u0027d like to be a part of history.\u0027           The mother-of-one carried a black handbag, which she wore slung over her shoulder           Earlier this week, it was reported that Doria had quit her job at a Los Angeles mental health care facility ahead of the royal wedding           It was reported that the social workers is looking to start her own private practice           Speculation is mounting that Doria will be the one to walk Meghan down the aisle at St. George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday          The driver was seen carrying Doria\u0027s small carry-on suitcase and overnight bag Thomas, who had a heart attack a week ago, returned to the hospital on Tuesday after having chest pains.He said a battery of tests found that the heart attack had done \u0027significant damage\u0027 and revealed he needed immediate surgery.    Thomas put the blame for his recent health troubles on his son Thomas Jr., who told Prince Harry that marrying Meghan would be the \u0027biggest mistake in royal wedding history.\u0027 However, the dad revealed that Meghan held no hard feelings against him for setting up paparazzi photos for money.When asked what the Queen thought about his money grab, Thomas laughed and said: \u0027I don\u0027t think the Queen is thinking about what I\u0027m doing.\u0027 Before changing his mind, Thomas said he believed his ex-wife Doria would be a \u0027good choice\u0027 to give their daughter away.Doria is the clear favorite to walk her down the aisle if Thomas is not cleared by doctors to fly.Prince Charles is 21 with the bookies to step in while Prince William is 51 to take Meghan into St George\u0027s before starting his duties as Harry\u0027s best man.

It was Doria’s decision to leave,\u0027 a source told the outlet. \u0027She has talked about starting her own private practice, focusing on working with elderly patients.\u0027 The reports about Doria\u0027s decision to quit her job come just one week after it was revealed that she had met with TV legend Oprah Winfrey at her $88 million Los Angeles home in order to discuss ideas for a tell-all interview. According to the Mirror Online, the duo spent six hours together going over potential topics that could be covered during a sit-down, with a source saying that they focused particularly on race and the role that it has played in Harry and Meghan\u0027s relationship.  \u0027Oprah and Doria spent a long time chatting and they got on really well,\u0027 the source said.          Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, has once again pulled out of his daughter\u0027s big day, revealing that he needs to have major heart surgery on Wednesday morning          The surgery seems to be the final end to speculation surrounding Thomas\u0027 attendance          Extended family: Meghan\u0027s nephews Tyler (R) and Thomas Dooley and their mother, Tracy Dooley (L), are in London for the wedding but they aren\u0027t thought to be attending the ceremony          \u0027What a journey so far!\u0027 Shortly after arriving in London, Tyler began sharing images of the trip on his Facebook page\u0027The most important and significant issue they spoke about was race and how badly some people had reacted to Meghan and Harry. \u0027What happened to Meghan and Harry was disgusting and they and all of their families were horrified. It’s an issue close to both Doria and Oprah, who have both suffered racism.\u0027 However, the interview reportedly needs to be approved by Meghan, Harry, and Buckingham Palace before it is recorded. Growing up, Meghan lived with her mother in a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in the Mid-Wilshire area of Los Angeles.  The Suits star\u0027s mother, Doria, and her father, Thomas, orced when she was six years old.Although Doria is thought to be the only close relative attending the royal wedding, members of Meghan\u0027s extended family are in town for Saturday\u0027s celebration. The former actress\u0027 nephews Tyler and Thomas Dooley and their mother, Meghan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracy Dooley, seem determined to take part in the big day.Despite previously revealing they hadn\u0027t received an invite to the royal wedding, the trio were seen making their way to the arrivals gate at the London airport on Monday with 13 suitcases.  The family have been enlisted as \u0027special correspondents\u0027 for Good Morning Britain and are expected to report from Windsor, though are thought not to be attending the ceremony.Meghan Markle\u0027s Father is Not Going to the Royal Wedding, Suffered Heart Attack | TMZ.comMeghan Markle on the 10 Women Who Changed Her Life | GlamourMeghan Markle\u0027s mum to reveal vile racial abuse suffered by family since daughter\u0027s engagement to Prince Harry - Mirror OnlineMeghan Markle\u0027s Dad Thomas to Undergo Heart Surgery and Can\u0027t Attend Wedding | TMZ.com"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/22/17/497CBE1100000578-5422621-image-a-40_1519320144076.jpg","title":"Theresa publish 100 page dossier Brexit vision","story":"    Theresa May will publish a 100-page dossier setting out the Government’s Brexit vision in detail next month in a bid to kick-start flagging trade talksTheresa May will publish a 100-page dossier setting out the Government’s Brexit vision in detail next month in a bid to kick-start flagging trade talks.The White Paper will be the biggest Government statement on Brexit since the 2016 referendum, setting out plans on everything from trade, transport and fishing to data protection and security co-operation.The decision to press ahead with the document represents a victory for David Davis, who has been arguing for months that the UK needs to get on the front foot over Brexit.Mr Davis told ministers yesterday the White Paper would include ‘detailed, ambitious and precise explanations of our positions... it should set out what will change and what will feel different outside the EU’.The move comes amid fears trade talks with Brussels have stalled.

It comes amid a row over the role of grammars in Britain’s educational landscape.Mr Heller-Sahlgren said that although his study did not examine the effects of selective schools – many of which are academies – they were likely to add to the phenomenon he had described. ‘One could make the argument that it increases choice and competition in the same way,’ he said.‘If grammar schools promote more choice and competition, you could argue in a roundabout way that the results might be relevant for that as well.’The study, which was based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was published in the Economics of Education Review.

Education Secretary Damian Hinds has approved a £50million fund to build extra classrooms. However, grammars bidding for the money must be able to prove that they are taking action to increase admissions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.It is thought that between 1,000 and 2,000 places could be created in areas where there is high demand from parents.The Department for Education said the move would give parents more choice and give more children of all backgrounds access to a good school place.But union leaders said ministers had no evidence that ‘shows strong educational benefit of this misguided policy’. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77537ab1a820b0cef480ddc3c723e2f743486af6/292_625_3271_1962/master/3271.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c986a04cd1f06d8c07512e9a0ec342d2","title":"tom wolfe a life in pictures","story":"The writer Tom Wolfe, who has died aged 88, was a great dandy, both in his elaborate dress and his neon-lit prose.

It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next levelHelsinki’s state-of-the-art Oodi library will stand opposite parliament and boast a cinema, recording studio and makerspace. It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next level“A library card was the first thing that was mine, that I had ever owned,” says Nasima Razmyar. The daughter of a former Afghan diplomat, Razmyar arrived in Finland with her family in 1992 as a refugee fleeing political unrest. Unable to speak the language, with scant resources, and trying to make sense of the strange new city she found herself in, she was stunned to discover she was entitled to a library card that would grant her books – for free. Her appreciation of the privilege has not faded: “I still have that library card in my wallet today,” she says proudly.Today, Razmyar is deputy mayor of Helsinki, and ready to champion the institution that has given her so much – starting with the construction of Oodi, the city’s new central library, due to open in December. She is not alone in her passion for libraries. “Finland is a country of readers,” declared the country’s UK ambassador Päivi Luostarinen recently, and it’s hard to argue with her. In 2016 the UN named Finland the world’s most literate nation, and Finns are among the world’s most enthusiastic users of public libraries – the country’s 5.5m million people borrow close to 68m books a year.Oodi – Ode in English – is more than a sober monument to civic pride. Commissioned as part of Finland’s celebration of a century of independence, the library is no mere book repository. “I think Finland could not have given a better gift to the people. It symbolises the significance of learning and education, which have been fundamental factors for Finland’s development and success,” says Razmyar. Libraries are seen as the visible face of the Finnish belief in education, equality and good citizenship. “There’s strong belief in education for all,” says Hanna Harris, director of Archinfo Finland and Mind-building’s commissioner. “There is an appreciation of active citizenship – the idea that it is something that everyone is entitled to. Libraries embody that strongly,” she adds.Those feelings of pride in the equality of opportunity offered by the city’s new library are echoed by the site chosen for Oodi: directly opposite parliament. “I think there is no other actor that could stand in front of the grounds of democracy like the public library does,” says Razmyar. “It’s remarkable that when standing on the open balcony of the library people are looking straight into the parliament and standing on the same level.”But Oodi isn’t the only Helsinki library to cause excitement. “Töölö library is one of my favourites,” says Harris. “It’s set in a park and has a rooftop balcony. Recently my colleagues and I went down there and there was a queue outside the doors – on a regular weekday morning, there was a queue at 9am to get in.”Perhaps a clue to the Finnish enthusiasm for libraries comes from the fact that they offer far more than books. While many libraries worldwide provide internet access and other services, libraries in cities and towns across Finland have expanded their brief to include lending e-publications, sports equipment, power tools and other “items of occasional use”. One library in Vantaa even offers karaoke.These spaces are not designed to be dusty temples to literacy. They are vibrant, well-thought-out spaces actively trying to engage the urban communities who use them. The library in Maunula, a northern Helsinki suburb, has a doorway that leads directly to a supermarket – a striking and functional decision which, along with its adult education centre and youth services section, was partly down to the fact that it was designed with input from locals. Oodi, however, will go even further: in addition to its core function as a library, it will boast a cafe, restaurant, public balcony, cinema, audiovisual recording studios and a makerspace with 3D printers. A sauna was apparently considered, but seems not to have made the final cut.This ersity is key, argues Razmyar. “Libraries must reach out to the new generations. The world is changing – so libraries are changing too. People need places to meet, to work, to develop their digital skills.”The site and design of Helsinki’s new library are certainly striking, but perhaps the most impressive thing about it is the lack of public opposition to such a costly project. “People are looking forward to Oodi. It’s not been contentious: people are excited about it across the board,” says Archinfo director Harris. “It will be important to daily life here in Helsinki.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e43a0ed2bb317bcdacb7247e73b08c90e9af482c/0_104_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f3f36ef35a3cfdb66ee6b0e4be6dfbe","title":"what have the royals done for the arts meghan markle prince harry wedding","story":"From the RSC to the ROH, Britain’s most prestigious arts institutions are all by royal appointment. But as Prince Harry marries Meghan Markle, is it goodbye Royal Variety Show and hello Royal Reprezent FM?The marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle means many things to many people, but, while loyalists are bagging their picnic spots and unpacking the union-jack party plates, some hard-pressed arts organisations will be taking a longer view.Once the party is over, reality strikes: a royal wedding means the admittance of a new member into “the firm” – and for them, a lifetime of public patronage. It has already been announced that Markle will become a partner in the Royal Foundation, set up by Princes William and Harry in 2009 as an umbrella for a clutch of charities. Besides youth work, the foundation’s portfolio is dominated by the princes’ preoccupations with the armed forces and conservation, while the charities that will be picked for Markle’s inidual support will – in Palace parlance – “reflect Miss Markle’s own interests”.The National Portrait Gallery and the art therapy organisation, Art Room, were among the first four charities to be chosen for her future sister-in-law, Kate. A clue as to where Markle’s interests might lead her – as a cosmopolitan mixed-race TV actor, with avowedly feminist views – lies in the couple’s second official engagement in January. It took them (on their own request) to the “youth-led” radio station Reprezent FM, in Brixton, south London, which is credited with launching the careers of a galaxy of DJs and grime stars, including this year’s Brit award-winner Stormzy.But what does royal patronage actually mean for the arts? For Reprezent, which was saved from closure three years ago by a crowd-funding appeal, even a one-off visit has been an overwhelming experience. “To be honest, we’re hunkered down. We’ve been inundated with requests, and there’s been a three-line whip across the board not to talk to the press about anything at all,” said their phone operator.Over the next four years, the specialist graduate college – whose alumni include Sylvia Pankhurst, Ian Dury, David Hockney and Tracey Emin – will expand to a new campus in Battersea and increase its student numbers from 1,900 to 3,000. It already recruits from 74 countries and the rapid growth both in numbers and costs will increasingly involve looking overseas, where the word “royal” is an invaluable calling card.“The royal connection has always been hugely beneficial when being seen on the international stage,” said a spokeswoman, “so we are no different from other great institutions such as the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Rada, Royal Opera House or Royal Shakespeare Company.” As Andy Hillier, editor of the charity sector magazine Third Sector, points out, the two great advantages of a royal association are publicity and trust. “For smaller organisations, the biggest advantage is publicity because it can be very difficult to draw attention to yourself. For larger organisations, the publicity benefit might not be so obvious unless you’re staging a big event, but trust is a big issue at the moment, and if you have a royal patron there is an assumption that there’s a royal stamp of approval and that you will have been thoroughly vetted.”The twists and turns of royal support are as bewildering as the Hampton Court maze. Presidencies and patronships come with varying, and not always consistent, levels of commitment. As a “royal visitor” Prince Charles is unlikely to visit the RCA much, though it hopes to profit from a hook-up with the Royal Drawing School, which he co-founded in 2000 as the Prince’s Drawing School, but which only went on to earn its “Royal” appellation in 2014. The announcement of this upgrade, by an institution that could be seen as the result of a hobbyist’s anachronistic obsession with “observational drawing”, is revealing: “With this name change, the Royal Drawing School joins the Royal Academy (1768), the Royal College of Music (1882), the Royal College of Art (1896) the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1920) and the Royal Ballet School (1956), as a member of the small circle of prestigious, world-renowned arts education institutions to bear the Royal title. It is the first such institution to be granted the name since the Royal Ballet School, which received its title in 1956 – the fourth year of the reign of HM Queen Elizabeth II.”The Royal College of Art’s headquarters – along with the Royal College of Music – are in an area of London once known as Albertopolis, in memory of the royal spouse who played a bigger role than others in the development of the UK’s enduring cultural capital.Prince Albert was the driving force behind the Great Exhibition, staged in a custom-built Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in 1851 with the not inconsiderable ambition, according to Queen Victoria, “to promote among nations the cultivation of all those arts which are fostered by peace, and which in their turn contribute to maintain the peace of the world”.Despite the disapproval of critics including Karl Marx, who deplored it as an “emblem of the capitalist fetishism of commodities”, the self-financing extravaganza, which is said to have been visited by six million people, turned in a profit big enough to buy a swath of land in South Kensington for a new cultural quarter that would include the three great national museums on Exhibition Road and the Royal Albert Hall.It’s a mark of the decline of royal power that, while Albert could influence the shape of a city, Prince Charles has had to content himself with a model village, incarnating his ardent architectural philosophy in the Beatrix Potter cottages and Disneyland castles of Poundbury, a new town that was planned and developed at his command on 400 acres of Dorset land from 1989.But, though the capacities of this century’s royal patrons might be reduced, their credibility has greatly improved since the late 1980s, when National Theatre director Richard Eyre fought a valiant rearguard action against being landed with a royal charter. “The ‘Royal National’ nonsense has burst like a fat blister,” he wrote in his diary in June 1988. “I haven’t yet had to publicly defend it, and am not looking forward to having to lie in public … Neal Ascherson writes to me that ‘everyone is looking to you to stop this royal nonsense’.”Thirty years on, Ascherson – a leading Scottish author and academic – feels just as strongly. “I’m not a fanatical anti-monarchist,” he says. “What I fancy is a country with republican institutions which, if people wanted, could have an ornamental bobble-king on top, like the royal republic of Norway.” Ironically, given her propaganda wars with “the firm”, the change in public opinion was partly due to Princess Diana’s touchy-feely support of charities working in previously stigmatised fields such as support for people with Aids and leprosy. Hillier points out that the younger generation have continued that tradition by extending royal patronage into mental health, “which is not an area the royal family has supported in the past”. He cites their support for the Heads Together campaign – encouraging people to be more open about mental illness – which involves a partnership with existing charities to challenge this social taboo. In today’s celebrity culture, part of their value is their ability to pull in showbiz stars – as Prince William did for Heads Together with Lady Gaga last year. Their four-minute Facetime chat, filmed in Kensington Palace and Lady Gaga’s Hollywood kitchen, was part of a series of celebrity heart-to-hearts that are now on YouTube.But to what extent do these enthusiasms extend beyond celebrity to the arts themselves? Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has concentrated on reading charities, with patronages including the National Literacy Trust and Book Trust. At the more glitzy end she’s become a regular at the Man Booker prize dinner, and will be hosting its 50th anniversary celebrations in July with a champagne reception at Buckingham Palace. Prince Charles – who has never sold himself as a great reader, though he’s known to love a spot of Shakespeare – discreetly backs (and personally attends) the Boswell book festival in the Scottish countryside. The boutique fiesta of biography and memoir takes place in Dumfries House – a Palladian mansion in Ayrshire that he rescued and restored, and which recently joined his School of Traditional Arts as part of the Prince’s Foundation.Prince Charles has never been one for public displays of emotion, but it won’t have escaped fans of Markle’s best-known TV role – paralegal Rachel in the series Suits – that one of her strongest suits is a capacity to emote to order.

The company paid £100m in 2017 for curtailment. This year payments are already down by two-thirds.Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director at industry group RenewableUK, said: “It is great news for everyone that rather than turning turbines off to manage our ageing grid, the new cable instead will make best use of wind energy.”Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Billions of pounds of investment is needed in clean energy, transport, heating and industry to meet our carbon targets. But a dramatic fall in investment is threatening the government’s ability to meet legally binding climate change targets.”Separately, the spending watchdog concluded that £23bn spent on a government subsidy scheme for low-carbon heating had been poor value for money and did not deliver its aims. The public accounts committee said the renewable heat incentive had “wildly optimistic” goals and that the government failed to understand what consumers wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/534c3c048403084c5418cb1258f9758be8d8cc31/0_0_1957_1174/master/1957.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bf2b54300d21873e536deff92773e81","title":"timor lestes incredible marine life in pictures","story":"Situated in the heart of the ‘coral triangle’, this young nation boasts some of the most bioerse waters in the world.

This giant straw hat is absurd to look at on a catwalk, but worn on a sandy beach, and photographed from behind, it encapsulates everything that summer is – and everything you want to be when you wear it. In short, to be seen while not being seen, ideally on holiday.It has also kickstarted what looks like the defining Instagram trend of the summer – hats with brims of alarming diameter. At Sensi, they are large and paper-braided, while versions at Topshop and Off White, although smaller, come with a wide brim as flat as the Norfolk Broads. At Missoni, they are shaped like an exaggerated wimple. At Gucci, they tie under the chin with a ribbon. At Delpozo, they are more bow-like than hat-like, but the sentiment remains.Dig deeper, and oversized hats serve the same seenunseen purpose on celebrities. Melania Trump hid beneath a white one designed by Hervé Pierre when the Macrons visited the White House. Justin Bieber dodged speculation over his love life in a straw version as he took a “meditative hike” through the hills.Jacquemus is the French label for cool French women. The Jacquemus girl, the handsome, oft-tanned designer Simon Porte Jacquemus once told the , “is not Parisian, and that is important. She is French, and French girls are not elegant, they are raw, casual, spontaneous.” It is also a label that likes to play with scale when it comes to accessories. His tiny Le Sac Chiquito handbags are the size of your fist, yet are the It bag of summer 2018. The La Bomba hat is the size of a manta ray, making it impossible to transport, yet it is long sold out and, even if it wasn’t, is comically antisocial, shielding not just its wearer from the sun but anyone on the same stretch of beach. And yet ...Hats have become heavy with meaning, and a good way to signal an allegiance – be it Trump’s red baseball cap or the pink pussy hats. If autumn 2017 was dominated by baseball caps worn by people who wouldn’t normally wear baseball caps, then other kinds of hats are successfully revised each season, and do the same job. See berets, stetsons and, now, straw hats. Much like Lenny Kravitz’s famously large scarf a few years ago, hats are the quickest way to signal a “don’t look at me, but, like, do” level of fame.If Instagram 2017 was all about tropical kitschiness, starring flamingos and cacti among other twee nostalgic tics, then this is the summer of the giant parody straw hat.

Advance word on the film suggested that it would feature scenes of sadistic violence and brutality, with Cannes director Thierry Frémaux saying that it featured “a subject so controversial” that it could only appear in an out-of-competition slot at the festival.That advance billing seems to have been lived up to, with Variety’s Ramin Setoodeh reporting more than 100 people leaving the cinema prematurely due to the film’s “disgusting” content. “Gross. Pretentious. Vomitive. Torturous. Pathetic,” wrote one attendee on Twitter, while entertainment reporter Roger Friedman described it as a “vile movie” that “should not have been made”. “He mutilates Riley Keough, he mutilates children... and we are all there in formal dress expected to watch it?” another viewer told Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan. Al Jazeera’s Charlie Angela also left the screening early, stating that “seeing children being shot and killed is not art or entertainment”.The scene which seems to have prompted the majority of walkouts is one in which Dillon’s character shoots two children at a family picnic in the head with a rifle. In another Keogh’s character is seen having her breast sliced off, while a flashback scene shows a child removing a duckling’s leg with a pair of pliers. Archive footage from concentration camps is also shown.Von Trier was making his first appearance on the Croisette since being declared “persona not grata” by the festival over a 2011 press conference in which he joked about sympathising with the Nazis. At the time the Cannes board declared the director’s comments “unacceptable, intolerable, and contrary to the ideals of humanity and generosity that preside over the very existence of the festival”. However, last month Cannes overturned the ban, with Frémaux saying that it was a “punishment that was disproportionate and that had lasted long enough”. That decision was greeted negatively in some quarters, with critics pointing to allegations made by the musician Björk, who claimed that Von Trier had sexually harassed her on the set of his film Dancer in the Dark. Von Trier denies the allegations.Critical response to The House That Jack Built has been largely negative. In a two-star review, the ’s Peter Bradshaw wrote that the film was “an ordeal of gruesomeness and tiresomeness that was every bit as exasperating as I had feared”, though he did admit that he was impressed by its “spectacular horror finale”. Also giving the film two stars was the ’s Robbie Collin, who wrote it “feels like way too much and nowhere near enough”, while, in an F-grade review, The Playlist’s Jessica Kiang described it as “misogynistic” and “irredeemably unpleasant”.Not everyone seems to have been appalled by The House That Jack Built, however. Setoodeh reports that the film received a standing ovation at the Cannes premiere, which prompted someone sitting near him to declare: “They’ll clap for anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeefdcd79e319bbc3ee471fcbf14a5996291578f/1157_198_2368_1421/master/2368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1399a177d5a77a17293d006c6468972","title":"margot kidder a life in pictures","story":"The 69-year-old actor, known for roles in Superman and The Amityville Horror, has died of throat cancer.

Both players went on to play in the calamitous defeat against Iceland in Nice that signalled the end of England’s Euro 2016 campaign and prompted Hodgson’s resignation, though neither is particularly tainted by the sort of tournament failure that has come to haunt teams from this country.Wilshere’s career has been bedevilled by injury, which is how he came to lose his place at Arsenal after an impressive climb through the youth ranks, and the season he spent on loan at Bournemouth after Euro 2016 could be regarded only as a qualified success. Once he was no longer integral to Arsenal plans he was no longer guaranteed an England call-up either and, if he does drop out of the reckoning for the World Cup in Russia, it will simply be the culmination of several seasons of disappointment.When Wilshere first broke through he looked so cultured and comfortable that people were talking in terms of a century of caps, or at least being a fixture on the international stage for a decade or more, which amounts to more or less the same thing.At 26, with 34 caps, it is now beginning to look as if he may not reach 50. He has undoubtedly been unlucky with the timing of some of his injuries, though it could also be said he has not always made the most of his opportunities.He has seen players such as Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson establish themselves through being more forceful on the pitch. In all probability Wilshere would have made it to Russia only as a squad player in any case and in that capacity his claims are now being challenged by Jesse Lingard and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.Hart’s is a completely different story. Though occasionally error‑prone with England, just as with Manchester City, the goalkeeper might still be clocking up appearances for both had not Pep Guardiola arrived and decided his distribution was not up to scratch – not just his ability with the ball at his feet inside and outside the box, but his accuracy with goalkicks and long clearances.Guardiola sets high standards for goalkeepers he wants the complete package. Claudio Bravo, Hart’s immediate replacement at City, was hardly that – the Chilean was not in the England player’s league as a shot‑stopper – though now Ederson has been brought in with an immaculate range of goalkeeping attributes there are far fewer people arguing Hart has been harshly treated.Nonetheless the goalkeeper is at the moment looking for a club after failing to win a regular place at West Ham and not quite answering his critics when on loan at Turin the previous season.Hart has 75 caps and has just turned 31 – no age at all for a goalkeeper – yet more doors seem to be closing than opening and after very publicly failing to live up to the standards required by a succession of managers there must now be question marks over his confidence.Doubtless he could find a berth almost anywhere as a reserve goalkeeper, which is in effect what he became when on loan at West Ham, though the role does not suit everyone.If Hart wishes to continue in a first team, he may have to consider dropping down the league a little and finding a club who would be glad of his considerable experience.That might be hard to swallow for a player whose two league titles are still fresh in the memory, along with four golden glove awards from his time as No\u0026nbsp1 at the Etihad Stadium, though it is already clear City have moved on. If Hart is to do the same, he needs to find regular football. With a bit of luck and the right club there may still be time left for a comeback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f5fe466233c05c9ea48c1b127d3e736b284c94/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13ee75f657d9effe1353bf093f91034c","title":"mikel arteta favourite to become arsenal manager replace wenger","story":"Mikel Arteta is the strong favourite to succeed Arsène Wenger as manager at Arsenal, with productive talks having progressed between his camp and the club.Conversations are so advanced that Arteta is giving thought to the people he might want in his backroom team.

But do you really need to carry your pet bunny instead of a bouquet and hashtag the hell out of the big day?Still, at this time of year, and with a royal wedding now tantalisingly close, it is worth considering how much weddings have changed in the past few years. These days, most of us get married later – 35 for women and 37 for men – often after years of cohabitation and frequently after parenthood. We have same-sex weddings, friends as celebrants, male bridesmaids, orced in-laws, second marriages, pies instead of fruitcake, and weddings on submarines and beaches and the London Eye, all of which demands a new kind of wedding etiquette.Let us consider the cautionary tale of Jeni Arrowsmith and Mark Wood, a couple from Wrexham who recently hired an owl to deliver their wedding rings. Sadly, after Bobby the barn owl had made his flight across the church, the waiting best man struggled to unclip the rings from his claw. Bobby became agitated and, distracted by an arm movement, descended on one of the groomsmen, who happened to have a terrible fear of birds. Despite the chance of such rogue turn of events, an increasing number of couples do choose to involve animals in their weddings, particularly their own pets. “Dogs are very common now, especially at the festival, boho, outside weddings,” says Kat Williams, the founder of the alternative wedding blog Rock n Roll Bride.Williams recalls a bride who walked down the aisle carrying her pet rabbit rather than a bouquet, and tells how her own sister employed a small herd of llamas to greet guests at her reception. But it is important to remember that the wellbeing of your beasts remains the priority – they should be fed, watered and cared for, and, should you be hiring them just for the day, you have a responsibility to investigate the credentials of the company you contract. Finally, keep in mind the solemn words of Anne-Marie Curtis, the editor-in-chief of Elle Wedding: “Introducing animals to a wedding can overcomplicate something that is already quite complicated.”One of the principal duties of bridesmaids used to be to confuse evil spirits and jealous suitors who might try to snaffle away the bride before she could even say her vows. They did this by cunningly dressing identically to the bride and similarly veiling their faces. Today, they perform the same duty more subtly – by wearing matching satin 50s numbers from Monsoon and mainlining enough prosecco to become incomprehensible by 7pm. Nevertheless, some brides have begun to break with convention here. “Some people do still want to have six child bridesmaids scattering rose petals,” says Curtis, “but you can also just have one friend,” and this could be a male friend. Williams notes the identical dresses are also on the wane, and these days “the mismatched look is really popular. So you might choose the same dress in different colours, or pick a colour and let your bridesmaids choose a dress style that fits their shape.” That should certainly keep the evil spirits on their toes.In the good old days you knew exactly where you were with speeches: a few tender words, thanks, and compliments to the bridesmaids from the groom, a misty-eyed tribute from the father of the bride, and a kind but fruity performance from the best man with no more than three allusions to previous girlfriends and whatever may or may not have gone on during the stag weekend in Magaluf. It was the point in a wedding day where guests could sit back and wonder at the simple glory of men speaking, very much like a boardroom meeting, or party conference, or a BBC panel game or, well, most situations in life ever. Sadly, since approximately 2014, women have been tiresomely harping on about their right to speak too, and now weddings frequently feature speeches from brides, bridesmaids and brides’ mothers. “Generally, weddings are events where you attend to tradition, but a lot of brides are questioning and challenging that tradition,” says Lucy Hume, an associate director at Debrett’s, which offers a wedding handbook and consultancy service. She advises that, especially if the wedding features more than three speakers, “ideally your speech should last around 10 minutes”. For anyone giving a best man or best woman’s speech, it is best to avoid props. “It’s always the best men who get out the PowerPoint presentation and everyone groans,” says Williams. “I think that’s on the way out.” And as far as risque anecdotes are concerned, she believes most guests are fairly unshockable these days. Still, she says, a good rule of thumb is: “Is the bride or groom going to kill you? Because it’s a fine line between embarrassing them and mortifying them.”Getting married in a technological age throws up many conundrums. Should you liveblog your vows? Ought you to invite Alexa to the wedding? Chief among them is the role of mobile phones and social media. Some couples opt for entirely phone-free weddings, while others encourage you to hashtag the hell out of the nuptials. “There’s no official etiquette,” says Hume. “Except when it comes to the ceremony, and then the celebrant may ask guests not to take photographs.” And some of it is plain common sense – what bride wants to see a video of herself dancing to Cardi B on a trestle table at 3am with the caption #helenandsuewed? Williams notes the futility of guests recording the ceremony on their phones: “It’s like being at a gig and there’s a sea of phones and you think, ‘When are you ever going to watch that?’” And it is perhaps best to ignore the whole idea of social media. “I think the pressure to post on the day adds a whole level of stress,” says Curtis. “And you really want to immerse yourself in the day itself.” Still, says Williams, “A social media ban is a bit harsh. It’s not the Met Gala.”It is easy to forget that in the olden days couples did not live together before marriage, setting up home together only after the big day. Wedding gift lists hail from this time and were designed to soften the blow when you realised that you had committed yourself to a lifetime with a man who eats with his mouth open, or a woman who sniffs – quietly, perhaps, but with the soul-destroying persistence of a dripping tap. Do gift lists really have any place in the modern world where most couples cohabit before they marry? “It really depends what life stage you’re at,” says Curtis. “It’s not necessarily about needing to set up house, but I think as a rule some kind of list can be helpful to guests.” Asking for cold hard cash is unfortunately still a touch outre. “There is still a resistance to people asking for it,” says Hume, although Williams points out that some wedding-list sites offer a monetary option. “If it goes through a company it feels less like you’re asking for cash in an envelope,” she says. Alternatively, you could suggest guests make donations to charity – although this can bring its own issues. For instance, my ex-husband and I are still joint owners of a small copse in east Lancashire as a result of our effort to hold a carbon-neutral wedding by encouraging guests to give to a tree-planting charity. We have not discussed visitation rights.Hen and stag dos are, according to Williams, “more popular than ever”, with some brides and grooms choosing to have more than one – a thought frankly more terrifying for the residents of Blackpool than the prospect of fracking on the Fylde coast. The thing to remember, says Curtis, is that hen or stag dos need not be expensive, elaborative or exclusive. “In this time-poor age, a hen or a stag do can be a nice way to spend time together, but everyone should be in agreement you have to make sure everybody’s comfortable and everybody’s having fun.” This extends, of course, to those employed to assist your event, be that the model in your life-drawing class, the waitress at your dinner or any member of the Chippendales. Such occasions are not an excuse to act like a boorish wazzock, even if you are dressed as She-Ra and chained to a unicycle.Approximately five years ago, surprise choreography became an almost inescapable part of wedding theatre – brides backflipping down the aisle, flashmobs, first dances where the ballad screeched to a halt and the happy couple suddenly launched into an elaborately well-rehearsed routine to Sir Mix-a-Lot. Indeed, it is now something of a relief for an entire wedding dance to go by without a romantic Uptown Funk breakout. “Maybe we have reached peak first dance,” says Hume, although she adds that there is really nothing wrong with a couple taking a preparatory class or two if they feel nervous about dancing in front of their guests. The performative moments of a wedding are a result of not just our wearisome social media age, but, says Curtis, an increasing pressure for couples to make their weddings feel more personal. “We’re all much bigger showoffs than we used to be,” she says. “And making a wedding more personal can become harder because there are no rules to follow. In some ways, it might have been easier when the bride’s parents paid for everything and you all trundled off down to the local church. But, you know, the best parts of any wedding are always the unchoreographed, unplanned moments.”Williams says that one of the questions she is most frequently asked by prospective brides is how to tell guests that their wedding will be child-free. “Children get bored, they need entertaining, and having them there can cost as much as having an adult guest.” Child-free weddings are increasingly common, and she advises making sure that this is stated on the invitation, telephoning any guests who might particularly object. For those who do invite children, be prepared to accommodate breastfeeding, potty-training, high chairs and perhaps squalling tantrums of boredom during Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians (although, in many ways, perhaps they will be speaking for everyone).Any knotty family matters – orced parents, old feuds, disapproval of a same-sex union – should be approached kindly and openly well before the big day. “Divorced parents are one of the common challenges people come to us for advice about,” says Hume. “We advocate a frank, open conversation from the outset.” She often suggests couples find a way for step-parents to be involved: one parent walking a bride down the aisle and another giving the speech, for instance. “Weddings are emotional subjects and you can be surprised by how excited people can get about them,” she says. Any guest who doesn’t respect the occasion should be treated in much the same way as that tantrumming toddler stropping their way through the ceremony: take them outside and give them a calm but firm talking to, well away from other guests. Remember that a wedding is about making sure everyone feels welcome, about celebration and love – things that it is sometimes easy to forget amid all the hashtags, wedding lists and barn owls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb1562241815b3fe99e3f50363d6960ac4cf8f0/487_1306_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d49b7055982eb4b58c9648f858553f","title":"nigel slater bresaola peas and feta recipe","story":"A fresh and sprightly piquant spring saladPut the juice of half a lemon, 6 tbsp of olive oil, 8 mint leaves and a small handful of parsley leaves into a blender, season with a little salt and process to a thick, bright green dressing.Slice a couple of medium-sized tomatoes, lay them in a single layer on a serving plate then moisten them with a spoonful of the dressing.

Swap the bresaola for thin slices of smoked trout, which will work beautifully with the peas, and include a little thinly sliced cucumber, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ce2e03e5459af8e82f19568e2e5490324c6e1e/0_0_4984_2989/master/4984.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a9c590cf33da62ef642adb20b23ead3","title":"acupuncture doesnt improve likelihood of ivf success study finds","story":"• Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morningAcupuncture doesn’t improve the chances of women undergoing IVF having a baby, according to a study of hundreds of Australian and New Zealand women.The treatment is widely used but researchers for the latest fertility study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Wednesday, have cast doubt on its effectiveness.A total of 848 women across 16 IVF centres in Australia and New Zealand were given either acupuncture or sham acupuncture, administered prior to a fresh embryo transfer and also on the day of it, between June 2011 and October 2015.• Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morningThe sham treatment involved placing a non-invasive needle with a blunt tip away from true acupuncture points.“These findings do not support the use of acupuncture to improve the rate of live births among women undergoing IVF,” the paper concludes.“The likelihood of a live birth was not statistically different between the two groups after adjusting for age, number of previous IVF cycles and participating IVF centre.”But the chief investigator, Caroline Smith, professor of clinical research at the National Institute of Complementary Medicine, said acupuncture might still be worthwhile.“Some studies suggest reproductive outcomes may be improved when acupuncture is compared with no treatment,” she said.According to the research, a “psycho-social benefit” from acupuncture was reported by women undergoing IVF.University of New South Wales Professor Michael Chapman, study co-author and president of the Fertility Society of Australia, said such benefits would be reported on in a future paper.“Feeling relaxed and reporting relief from stress and women feeling good about themselves is to be welcomed for women as they undergo an IVF cycle,” he said.Comment was being sought from the Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec24107310c77f0e63c4aff9a0145a5721b1830/134_558_2155_1293/master/2155.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3ebc9560b55ac84f9b0f9393ef873a8","title":"six of the best party cakes prince harry meghan wedding claire ptak","story":"Whether you’re celebrating Harry and Meghan’s wedding or a birthday, do it with this selection of festive cakes by royal wedding baker Claire Ptak125g unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing200g caster sugar3 eggs1 tsp vanilla extract1 tsp salt300g plain flour2 tsp baking powder160g whole milk6 tbsp raspberry jamFor the icing120g fresh raspberries500g icing sugar, sifted, plus 2 tbsp extra1 tbsp milk190g unsalted butter, softened½ tsp kirsch½ tsp lemon juiceYou will need a piping bag with a large round nozzle for this recipe. Heat the oven to 150C300Fgas 2. Grease and line a deep 20cm cake tin.Cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, vanilla and salt, and mix.In a separate bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then fold half into the butter. Add in the milk, then the remaining flour. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix once more. Pour into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes. Leave to cool for 15-20 minutes, then remove from its tin by running a small paring knife along the inside of the tin to release the cake. Or, if you have used a loose-bottomed tin, set the base of the cake tin on top of a tin of tomatoes, or similar, and gently push the sides of the cake tin down.To make the icing, puree the raspberries with the two tablespoons of icing sugar, then strain. Transfer to an electric mixer. Add the milk, butter and 250g of the icing sugar, and beat on low for three minutes. Add the rest of the sugar and beat until the icing is light but holds its shape. Mix in the kirsch and lemon juice.Wash and dry the cake tin, and line with clingfilm with plenty lapping over the sides and set aside. Using a serrated bread knife (the longest one you have), score a horizontal line a third of the way up the side of the cake and then slowly cut the cake into thirds horizontally. Trim the top layer slightly if it is domed. Slide a tart tin base or cardboard disc between the bottom and middle layers of the cake, and lift off the top two layers on to a large plate. Slide the bottom layer of sponge into the lined cake tin and pipe a border of icing around the edge. Don’t worry if the icing touches the sides of the tin, as you are essentially creating a dam for the filling.Smooth half the jam over, and pipe a few stripes of icing on top. This acts as a glue to adhere one cake to another and it also creates delicious pockets of jam and icing between the layers.Put the middle sponge on top and repeat the above process. Top with the third sponge, pull up the sides of clingfilm and wrap up the cake. Chill for at least two hours, or overnight before removing from the tin to ice the top and sides.

Grease a 25cm x 10cm loaf tin with butter and line the base and sides with parchment paper, to about 5cm above the top of the tin.In an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar well. Mix in the lemon zest, then beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix half of this into the creamed butter mixture, scraping down the sides, until barely combined.With the mixer still going, beat in all the milk, then add the rest of the flour and mix until just combined. Scrape the bowl and give it one last mix.Scoop the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the cake is springy and a skewer comes out clean.Meanwhile, make the lemon drizzle: in a small pan, heat the sugar, water and lemon juice until the sugar is just melted. Do not let it boil or it will lose its fresh flavour. While the cake is still in the tin, use a skewer to poke holes evenly throughout the baked loaf. Pour over the drizzle.To make the icing, in a small bowl, whisk the icing sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Take the cake out of the tin: run a small paring knife along the inside of the tin, then tilt the tin on its side and coax the loaf out, using the parchment as a handle. Peel off the paper and turn the loaf on your cooling rack or worktop. Drizzle with the icing and let it drip down the sides, then use a spatula or a cake or tart tin base to lift the loaf on to a serving dish.175g butter, softened, plus more for greasing175g light brown sugar2 eggsSeeds of 1 vanilla pod125g ground almonds175g wholemeal spelt flour2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt200g halved cherries, or whole berries200g peaches or nectarines, sliced2 tbsp caster sugar, for sprinklingRose petals, for scattering (optional)For the icing (optional) 200g icing sugar1-2 tbsp rose waterHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. Grease a 23cm cake tin with butter and line with parchment paper.First make the sponge. In an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almonds, and mix to combine.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt, then gently beat the dry ingredients into the butter mixture.Spread the batter into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Scatter the cherries over the batter, then press the slices of peach into the top.Sprinkle with the caster sugar and bake for 60-70 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back to the touch. Let the cake cool in its tin for about 15 minutes before turning it out on to a serving plate.If using the icing, whisk the rose water into the icing sugar until smooth and runny. Drizzle this over the cooled cake, then scatter with garden rose petals, if you have them. This is best eaten on the day you bake it.100g unsalted butter, plus more for greasing 100g plain flour, plus more for dusting 1 tbsp honey2 tsp rose water100g caster sugar2 eggs 1 tsp baking powderFor the icing2-3 tbsp rose syrup 200g icing sugarYou will need a 12-hole madeleine tin to make these. First, prepare the tin. Melt a good amount of butter and leave to cool slightly, then brush it into the tin and dust with flour. Put the tin in your freezer forfive minutes or so, then repeat the process – if you are using a silicone mould, you can omit this second step. Keep the tin in the freezer until you are ready to use it.Heat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, carefully melt the butter, then take off the heat and leave to cool slightly. Add the honey to the butter to dissolve it, then add the rose water.In a bowl, whisk the caster sugar and eggs until smooth, then whisk in the melted butter mix. In another bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then whisk these dry ingredients into the egg and butter mix until smooth. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin.Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the madeleines have formed a peak in their middles and the tops spring back to the touch. Take out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a minute or two.Meanwhile, make the icing: whisk the rose syrup into the icing sugar until smooth and runny.Turn the madeleines out of the mould and dip them in the icing or drizzle over the top. Serve right away – they are best eaten within the hour. (Remember, you can make the madeleine mixture in advance and bake it just before you want to serve.)Butter, for greasing350g dates, pitted and chopped150g hazelnuts, toasted and chopped finely3 eggs1 tsp vanilla extract 50g caster sugar50g brown sugar200g oil140g plain flour2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt100g plain yoghurtFor the praline topping50g hazelnuts, toasted and skins removed50g water200g caster sugarFor the icing4 tbsp water 300g icing sugarHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. Grease two 18cm cake tins with butter and line with parchment. Mix the dates and hazelnuts in a bowl and set aside.Using an electric mixer, whisk together the eggs, vanilla and sugars until light and fluffy. Keep whisking and slowly drizzle in the oil.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Add this to the egg mixture and whisk for a few seconds to combine. Whisk in the yoghurt, then fold in the dates and hazelnuts.Divide the mixture between the prepared tins and bake for 35-45 minutes, until the cakes are baked but not dry. The tops of the cakes will not spring back as much as other cakes do because the dates make the mixture moist and dense in the best possible way. Leave the cakes to cool in the tins while you make the topping.To make the topping, line a baking tray with parchment paper and spread the hazelnuts on the tray. Put the tray on your worktop, near the hob. Have your icing ingredients nearby, as they will be needed as soon as the caramel is ready.Put the water in a small, heavy-bottomed pan and sprinkle in the caster sugar. Bring to the boil and, just as the sugar starts to caramelise, pour half of it over the hazelnuts. Leave to cool and harden, then break into shards.To make the icing, add the water to the remaining caramel in the pan, then pour the runny caramel from the pan into the icing sugar and whisk to a smooth paste. Add more water or icing sugar until it has the consistency of soft buttercream. Spread the icing on the cooled cakes and top with the shards of praline.115g butter, melted, plus more for greasing90g plain flour1 tsp baking powder 50g ground almonds40g ground hazelnuts40g ground pistachios190g icing sugar5 egg whites, lightly whisked2 tsp vanilla extract200g fresh raspberries (about 40-50)50g slivered pistachiosIcing sugar, for dustingHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3.

While Cipriani has mustered only 14 caps after winning his first 10 years ago, his unwavering belief in his ability meant he could never close the chapter on England.Jones had overlooked him because he did not see Cipriani contentedly accepting a bit-part role. A player who had had training-ground disputes with the two previous England regimes was considered by some to be disruptive. After a Six Nations campaign in which the champions of the previous two seasons looked off the pace and lost their last three matches to finish fifth, Cipriani’s instinctive attacking flair counts for more than his reputation as a player who took some handling.“I have been here before and it’s not about following the wave up and down and letting your emotions ride with it but staying on an even keel,” Cipriani said before what will be his final game for Wasps on Saturday unless they defeat Saracens in the Premiership play-off at Allianz Park.“Anyone who knows me knows I’ve played the game just to play for England. It is now down to me to make sure things go well. I never gave up on England otherwise I would have signed a contract months ago.“I love the attritional side of French rugby and I had conversations. It was not easy to hold out with people pointing out that I was not getting picked but perhaps that wasn’t the right moment for me. When it is meant to be, it will all fall into place. It is tough to break into a squad with so much quality but I have an opportunity to go in and leave a positive imprint.”Cipriani will face his England tour captain in South Africa next month, Owen Farrell, when Wasps look to reach the final in consecutive seasons, although their league record against Saracens is poor – two victories in the past 13 meetings, both when Saracens fielded a weakened side.“Owen has stayed at the top of his game for a while,” Cipriani said. “He drives and runs the team and is the focal point of a Sarries attack that can cut teams apart. He has a huge amount of intensity and I am looking forward to working with him on the tour.”Cipriani has never been afraid to question authority and the first impression he makes on Jones, who from his first days with England has said he wants players to effectively make him redundant by being able to react to changing circumstances, will go a long way to determining whether he goes to the World Cup having missed out in 2011 and 2015.“As different challenges come about over the years, so mistakes happen. That gets viewed as such a negative thing: a kid makes a mistake and gets told off. You learn from mistakes it is how you improve. It is a message for people to understand: you won’t get to the top unless you make mistakes and I hope, after the ones I have made, I am the best version of myself right now and can keep improving.”Cipriani is leaving a club – as is the former Wasps captain James Haskell, who is a doubt for Saturday with a toe injury – who have not tried to rein him in. “Danny has been on fire in the last three months and was playing well before that,” said the Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, who added there was no offer of a new contract because he could not wait until the end of the season for Cipriani to sort out his future. Gloucester looks the ideal refuge with their coach, Johan Ackermann, a believer in players backing their judgment.Cipriani was asked what his 18‑year‑old self would say to him now. “He would offer a high-five and say he would not have expected me to come through as I have. I feel lucky to be sitting here with a semi-final to play on Saturday and going on, I hope, to play for England again.”Saracens are likely to go into their home semi-final against Wasps boosted by the presence of Billy Vunipola. “We’re very hopeful Billy will be fine,” Mark McCall said. “Unless there’s a setback. He did everything we asked of him.”McCall would not be drawn on whether Vunipola would start on Saturday but with Schalk Burger and Callum Clark missing it seems likely. “He’s a great player. We’ve done without him for the whole year, so it’s a big boost for the team, and for Billy, to get on the park again – hopefully!”The Wales full-back Liam Williams is touch and go with a shoulder injury.

Not for the first time the England and Wales Cricket Board promised “fresh ideas” and Smith duly delivered some that were genuinely fresh, coherently explained and rationally justified, unlike one or two other membersemployees of the board in recent times.He was also remarkably relaxed in his new role. He can articulate with the best of them indeed he sounded rather like his recent Australian counterpart, John Inverarity, who first bounced Smith on his knee at Tonbridge almost 40 years ago. He was enthusiastic and accommodating.“That’s a good question”, he said several times to his former colleagues everything would be “terrific”. His was a polished debut in front of the press – he even managed to exit the room just as a question about The Hundred was being framed.Smith has broken with convention – though he kept stressing that “we” or “the selection panel” were responsible for the erting list of 12 names chosen for the Lord’s Test – by selecting someone who has not encountered a red ball this year. This is a risk. But it is not a ridiculous one. He has long admired Jos Buttler and there is no doubting the wicketkeeper batsman’s talent or temperament he knows and likes the grand occasion. But there is the problem that he has recently been programmed to hit every ball he receives for six or four, which he has been doing regularly for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.Buttler, while encouraged to play with freedom, will have to rediscover how to bat in a Test match – in a Test match at Lord’s. This is quite an undertaking but trusting in “a unique talent” and defying old truisms meets personal approval.Indeed Smith’s selections have brought a smile especially to the West Country. Even though the word “Lancashire” appears after the name of Buttler in the list, most of his fans in England reside west of Bristol, where he was born. Now having mourned the cruel injury to Jack Leach in the nets at Taunton on Monday, those fans can also celebrate the rapid elevation of Dom Bess out west.If this is not the case already, Bess might soon become the best off-spinner to come out of Blundell’s School in Tiverton and Somerset CCC for half a century or more. He has played only 16 first-class games, most of them on turning pitches at Taunton (or in Bridgetown, Barbados, where he took eight wickets for MCC in the match against Essex in March as well as hitting a century). Two or three years ago he was moving from Sidmouth CC in Devon to Exeter CC partly in search of more bowling opportunities. Now a Test match at Lord’s beckons – he is bound to play if the sun stays out.Bess was quick to commiserate with Leach, who has been a source of much sound advice for him over the last two years. In fact he is almost the polar opposite of Leach as a cricketer. Leach is a methodical man, who has improved by dint of much hard graft as a batsman and fielder as well as a bowler. Bess, who made his debut for Somerset in a two-day game against Pakistan in 2016, is more of an instinctive sportsman and a natural athlete. If the force is with him, things happen.He is a clean striker of the ball, who would bat above Stuart Broad in this team he will certainly raise the standard of England in the outfield, where he buzzes and is capable of the odd breathtaking moment. So far he has never seemed overawed, though Lord’s will represent the highest hurdle yet.In Somerset’s recent game against Hampshire at Taunton Bess struck a breezy 92 and propelled 41 overs, taking the solitary wicket of Rilee Rossouw in the first innings for 77 runs. He bowled with sound control, admittedly against batsmen set upon saving the game in the second innings when most of his deliveries were at James Vince, who may have produced the most mature innings of his career and certainly his longest (514 minutes). Bess has already shown he is not intimidated by bowling on a turning pitch (some spinners are) there is less evidence about how he fares on a flat one. However he is always up for the challenge and his debut will be an exciting moment, not just for those in Devon and Somerset.Indeed the announcement of this squad prompts a smile and a spring in the step it represents the most cheerful thing to come out of the ECB this summer. A month ago Smith was unlikely to be the man to provide fans with eager anticipation. This season your correspondent has occasionally railed against The Hundred and the plans for domestic cricket to no great effect. Now on consecutive days Colin Graves, albeit unwittingly, seems to have been more effective in providing reasons to reconsider the ECB’s ship of the game. Meanwhile Smith, trusting his gut rather than the data (though he is “interested in data”), has, by making two bold selections, invigorated the summer of 2018. The first Test should be fun for young and old alike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12d924384b1fa300fc427e4851fdc4fabcc4a17e/17_116_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ec76015957f5e0b0346b83e6c5a26ce","title":"ireland moment sun setting test cricket malahide pakistan","story":"North Richmond Street, being blind, is a quiet street. There is nothing there to tell you what went on at No 17, the red-brick terrace house where James Joyce lived as a kid. Round the back there is a courtyard garden, where Joyce spent happy hours batting against his brother John. “I remember having to bowl for him for perhaps an hour at a time,” John wrote. “I did so out of pure goodness of heart since, for my part, I loathed the silly, tedious, inconclusive game.” James was a “useful bat” and “eagerly studied the feats of Ranji and Fry, Trumper and Spofforth”. Years later he threaded the four of them into the text of Finnegans Wake.It was the week for old stories about Irish cricketers. There is another about Samuel Beckett, half-true, about how, when he lived in Ussy-sur-Marne, he would drive the neighbour’s boy to school in his convertible. The kid was so big he could not fit in the bus seats. When he grew up they called him André the Giant. “I asked André what he and the famous author talked about when they were together,” wrote Cary Elwes. “‘Mostly cricket,’ André recalled.” Beckett opened the batting and bowling for Trinity College. He had a first-class batting average of 8.75 and, like Joyce, he never lost his taste for it.It is funny to think these great men had the same daydreams as the rest of us. Joyce and Beckett are two famous members of the small band of Irish Test match fans. In the 20th century this was a fruitless pursuit. For the past 140 years the only way an Irishman would play Test cricket was if he got picked for England. Leland Hone was the first to do it, in 1879. Hone, who kept wicket in the third-ever Test, was the first of seven Irishmen to play Tests for England. But there were many more, boys and men, who would have played for Ireland if they had had the chance.Men like Tom Ross, who took nine for 28 against South Africa, and Dougie Goodwin, who took five for six against West Indies in that famous game at Sion Mills in 1969. Men like Scott Huey, who topped Wisden’s first-class averages in 1954. In those days a bowler needed to take 10 wickets to qualify for Wisden’s list. Huey played only one first-class game all summer, against MCC, but he took 14 for 97. Men like Jimmy Boucher, who took 168 wickets in first-class cricket, at 14 each, seven of them for 13 runs against New Zealand.The inaugural Irish Test XI took to the field for the first time at Malahide last Saturday, at least a hundred years later than they might have done. “Tomorrow 11 of us will represent the 688 who have gone before us,” wrote Andy Balbirnie. “Thank you for paving the way for us to fulfil our dreams.”Malahide came as a sweet relief for an Englishman, upwind from Colin Graves’ Ratner-esque blather and the ECB’s steaming pile of “fresh tactical dimensions”. Graves, 70, was at it again on Monday, pontificating on the BBC about what the “younger generation” want. There was never a better reason to switch over to Guerilla Cricket, where it was broadcasting Kevin O’Brien’s fine innings, the first Test hundred for Ireland. It almost set up an improbable victory but in the end Ireland lost by five wickets. Which means Australia are still the only team to win their first Test.Except even in Ireland, where Test cricket was only just born, there was a whiff of something terminal about it. Over the weekend Brendon McCullum, the former New Zealand captain who did as much for the format as any other modern player, said in an interview: “I firmly believe Test cricket won’t be around in time, because there’s only so many teams that can afford to play it.”Ireland are not one of them. One could hear it in the words of their captain, William Porterfield, and chief executive, Warren Deutrom. “For most countries,” the latter said, “Test cricket, apart from England-Australia, which is the obvious exception, is a loss-leader.”Ireland are due to play only 16 Tests in the next five years. “It is going to be very hard to organise three- or five-game series with the cost that is involved. It would be great if we could play quite a few Tests a year but it is not financially viable as it stands,” Porterfield added. “That is what it is.”For all our romantic blarney about what Test cricket means to the Irish, Porterfield’s blunt truth is that the chance to play the game is just a bonus that came along with full membership of the ICC, which Ireland were finally granted last year. Full membership allows their administrators to plan not just for six to 12 months but three years down the line, to know what fixtures they are going to get and what funding they are going to get.“So that is probably the biggest thing it brings from Cricket Ireland’s point of view,” Porterfield said, “and Test cricket comes along with that and we are fortunate enough to get that opportunity. But, to be honest, T20 probably has taken over.”One could see that in the scaffolding grandstands. Cricket Ireland had set up only 6,000 seats and it did not fill them. When Ireland play two T20s against India this summer, the capacity will be increased to 8,000. Outside England and Australia Test cricket is a heritage business. The Irish may as well have discovered a sudden enthusiasm for steam trains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d13f3e82338e98b9f55a8665f2cbbc7840f7d101/0_85_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bfff008749db4b2d08acc2455025632","title":"prasanna puwanarajah patrick melrose benedict cumberbatch planet acting didnt need someone like me","story":"He used to get cast as either a doctor or a terrorist. Now Prasanna Puwanarajah is on stage at the National, starring opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Patrick Melrose – and even writing his own sci-fi showIt was nine years ago that Prasanna Puwanarajah last worked on a hospital ward – he went from there to rehearsals for Twelfth Night at the Royal Shakespeare Company. In the previous two years, he had been working as a jobbing actor, writer and director, and as a doctor – going wherever he was needed in the NHS, and fitting in auditions, making a couple of short films, directing some plays, in between. He had been deferring a training post in reconstructive surgery, and at some point, though he never really made a definitive decision, he just never went back to medicine.We meet at the National Theatre, where Puwanarajah is appearing in Absolute Hell. There is still something doctorly about his manner – the steady voice the careful, analytical responses. The National is a place that proved instrumental in his career change. “I’d done a show at the Arcola,” he says, “and I was heading back to the NHS. I got auditions at the RSC and then at the National. I came here and did four shows and wrote a play, over the course of a year and a half. It felt vibrant and exciting and possible.” Puwanarajah’s career has been steady, but at the age of 36, he is powering forward with an impressively broad slate of projects. His most high-profile TV role to date was as Suranne Jones’s bewildered boyfriend in the last series of Doctor Foster. Now he is playing opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Patrick Melrose, Sky Atlantic’s adaptation of the Edward St Aubyn novels. He’s about to appear in the forthcoming BBC comedy legal series Defending the Guilty, will direct two plays – one at Rada, another in Edinburgh – and (hopefully) a feature film, set in Northern Ireland. Then, he’s co-creating and writing a sci-fi series for a US network with Line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio. Nearly a decade after abandoning a stable career, he must feel vindicated.Both his parents, who moved to the UK from Sri Lanka, worked in the health service – his mother a drug and alcohol dependency psychiatrist, his father a dentist. Theatre wasn’t a big part of Puwanarajah’s childhood – he remembers going to the pantomime once as a child. Then he appeared in a couple of school plays. “I didn’t want to, but I remember vividly the surprise of enjoying the experience and enjoying the collective activity,” he says. As a teenager, he tried out for a place at the National Youth Theatre and the man auditioning him asked him why he wanted to be an actor. “I said ‘I don’t, I’m going to be a doctor’.” He got in, probably, he says with a laugh, on the basis that his answer intrigued them. The following year, during the summer break from medical school, he was back to do one of their shows. “I think out of 14 people in the show I was the only one who didn’t get any phone calls from agents and I was like, again, not fussed: ‘That makes perfect sense.’ I was pretty sure that Planet Acting doesn’t need someone like me.” He smiles. “I mean a brown person.”He is wary of the idea of “colourblind” casting. “I just don’t think we’re colourblind people,” he says. “My experience has not been of people being blind to it.” To skip through a few of Puwanarajah’s experiences may feel a bit superficial, but it makes his point: as a child, he was threatened for wearing an England football shirt in an operating theatre once, a colleague told him his English was surprisingly good a few weeks after the Brexit vote, he was told by two men, on the street in the middle of the day, to “fucking go home”.

These can be mundane – football, Manhattan or dogs, for instance – or more esoteric.A  investigation in conjunction with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation found that Facebook is able to infer extremely personal information about users, which it allows advertisers to use for targeting purposes. Among the interests found in users’ profiles were communism, social democrats, Hinduism and Christianity.The EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on 25 May, explicitly labels such categories of information as so sensitive, with such a risk of human rights breaches, that it mandates special conditions around how they can be collected and processed. Among those categories are information about a person’s race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, sex life and sexual orientation.The information commissioner’s office says: “This type of data could create more significant risks to a person’s fundamental rights and freedoms, for example, by putting them at risk of unlawful discrimination.” Organisations must cite one of 10 special dispensations to process such information, such as “preventive or occupational medicine”, “to protect the vital interests of the data subject”, or “the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes”.Facebook already applies those special categories elsewhere on the site. As part of its GDPR-focused updates, the company asked every user to confirm whether or not “political, religious, and relationship information” they had entered on the site should continue to be stored or displayed. But while it offered those controls for information that users had explicitly given it, it gathered no such consent for information it had inferred about users. The data means an advertiser can target messages at, for instance, people in the UK who are interested in homosexuality and Hinduism – about 68,000 people, according to the company’s advertising tools.Facebook does demonstrate some understanding that the information is sensitive and prone to misuse. The company provides advertisers with the ability to exclude users based on their interests, but not for sensitive interests. An advertiser can advertise to people interested in Islam, for instance, but cannot advertise to everyone except those interested in Islam.The company requires advertisers to agree to a set of policies that, among other things, bar them from “using targeting options to discriminate against, harass, provoke or disparage users, or to engage in predatory advertising practices.”In a statement, Facebook said classifying a user’s interests was not the same as classifying their personal traits. “Like other internet companies, Facebook shows ads based on topics we think people might be interested in, but without using sensitive personal data. This means that someone could have an ad interest listed as gay pride because they have liked a Pride-associated page or clicked a Pride ad, but it does not reflect any personal characteristics such as gender or sexuality.” The company also said it provided some controls to users on its ad preferences screen. “People are able to manage their ad preferences tool, which clearly explains how advertising works on Facebook and provides a way to tell us if you want to see ads based on specific interests or not. When interests are removed, we show people the list of removed interests so that they have a record they can access, but these interests are no longer used for ads.”It added: “Our advertising complies with relevant EU law and, like other companies, we are preparing for the GDPR to ensure we are compliant when it comes into force.”The findings are reminiscent of Facebook’s previous attempts to skirt the line between profiling users and profiling their interests. In 2016 it was revealed that the company had created a tool for “racial affinity targeting”.At the time, Facebook repeatedly argued that the tool “is based on affinity, not ethnicity”. Discussing a person who was in the African American affinity group, for instance, the company said: “They like African American content. But we cannot and do not say to advertisers that they are ethnically black.”Almost a year later, after it was revealed that advertisers could use the ethnic affinity tools to unlawfully discriminate against black Facebook users in housing adverts, Facebook agreed to limit how those tools could be used."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e29bec3ffd2ff6f501db2188693666cd10b77687/0_96_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1af0196487326f55da43cf02c7d02960","title":"the windsors royal wedding special review gloriously brazen satire","story":"Bert Tyler-Moore and George Jeffrie’s ruthless comedy is a reminder that you can get away with a lot as long as you are funny“Yes!” shouts Meghan Markle. “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!” Not in a When Harry Met Sally way, but in a Harry met Meghan and finally got around to proposing way (Channel 4).

The language could not be clearer. Moreno has made it plain that the world’s most famous lodger has overstayed his welcome in Ecuador’s London embassy.Nearly six years ago, it was a different story. When Ecuador granted Assange political asylum on 16 August 2012, the country’s then foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, said Ecuador believed the WikiLeaks founder’s fear of persecution was legitimate and praised “his dedicated defence of freedom of expression” in a speech in Quito.But what was expected to be a stopover turned into a lengthy sojourn and Assange became one of the world’s most high-profile fugitives. During the past six years, he has refused to step out of the embassy building, fearing he would be arrested by British police and extradited to the US for questioning over WikiLeaks’ activities. Assange’s behaviour has not endeared him to his hosts. For instance, his tweets in favour of Catalan independence are said to have annoyed the Spanish government, souring relations between Madrid and Quito. The publication by WikiLeaks of emails connected to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election may be another reason why Ecuador’s foreign minister, María Fernanda Espinosa, said at the start of this year that Assange’s continued stay was “unsustainable”.Moreno has been seeking to build bridges with the US, restoring trade ties that were damaged in recent years. Ecuador seems to be hoping that Assange’s already uncomfortable confinement will become intolerable.It is hard to see how Assange can leave the embassy and not end up being arrested for breach of bail, which could lead to him being imprisoned.Ecuador has explored a number of other ideas, none of which seems feasible. In January, its foreign ministry said Assange had been made an Ecuadorian citizen in an attempt to resolve the impasse over his continued stay at the embassy. The UK Foreign Office responded by saying: “Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice.”Espinosa is one of two candidates campaigning to be elected the 73rd president of the UN general assembly next month. Some in Ecuador have speculated that she might appoint Assange as Ecuador’s United Nations representative, in order to get him UN diplomatic status so he can leave the UK. However, the foreign ministry has said if Espinosa is elected, she would not be responsible for Assange’s case.Intelligence service documents seen by the  suggest the UN idea has previously been considered. Assange’s nomination as Ecuador’s representative to the UN would afford him diplomatic immunity while travelling to UN meetings around the world, one document said. It also suggested trying to smuggle him out in a diplomatic vehicle, but accepted the fact that to do so he would have to leave the embassy, and risk being detained, before getting into the car. British police ended a costly 24-hour guard of the embassy in October 2015, but the building remains under covert surveillance.Rafael Correa: president of Ecuador from 2007 to 2017Correa came to power in 2007 at the tail end of the “pink tide” that swept through Latin America, ushering in leftist leaders such as Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia. Correa styled himself as an anti-imperialist, shunning what was regarded as US interference in the region.He won three elections and changed the constitution while courting, at the peak of his powers, the highest approval rating of any leader in the country’s history.The US-trained economist faced criticism when he announced in 2008 that Ecuador was officially defaulting on billions of dollars of foreign debt, forcing the country to seek unfavourable loans, particularly from China.Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since August 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.But it was Correa’s authoritarian style and constant attacks against the press that drew more international opprobrium. He brought in a communications law that obliged media outlets to carry government messages, and used his weekly TV shows to personally attack journalists, often tearing up newspapers.Correa came to wider international attention after offering asylum to Assange in 2012. He left behind a wealthier and fairer country, but a more ided one.Lenín Moreno: president of EcuadorMoreno narrowly won the 2017 election as Correa’s successor and the candidate for his Alianza País party. Some dismissed Moreno as a puppet of his domineering predecessor, but he soon proved to be his own man.Moreno, the world’s only head of state to use a wheelchair, made good on a pledge to tackle graft by sacking the former vice-president Jorge Glas, a close ally of Correa, with Glas later sentenced to six years in jail for corruption.He criticised Correa for mismanaging the economy and leaving the country saddled with debt, mostly to China.The result is a bitter feud between former allies. Moreno, who served as Correa’s vice-president from 2007 to 2013, has repeatedly hinted that he wants to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.He has also stressed that his respect for press freedom is one of his key differences with his predecessor.Moreno has a fondness for singing in public and making jokes. He has written books about humour, which he used to alleviate depression when he was left partially paralysed after being shot in a robbery in 1998.He is leading advocate of disabled rights in Ecuador, for which he was nominated for the Nobel peace prize in 2012. Moreno was appointed the UN special envoy on disability and accessibility in December 2013.

He rang the bell, walked in and asked for political asylum.It was Julian Assange. Days earlier, he had lost his long legal fight against extradition to Sweden, where two women accused him of rape.Soon afterwards, the left-leaning then president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, agreed to Assange’s request, precipitating a major diplomatic row with the British government. And a full-blown siege. politan police officers swarmed outside the building, ready to arrest Assange should he venture out.It was against this febrile backdrop that Correa authorised a secret programme named “Operation Guest”. It was later renamed “Operation Hotel”. The guest was Assange, politely referred to as el huésped.The goal, at first, was to stop detectives bursting into the modest ground-floor embassy and dragging Assange away. But documents seen by the  show it developed into something more complex. The aim seems to have changed from protecting Assange – which propped up WikiLeaks in the process – to spying on him.Whatever its aims, WikiLeaks was able to keep going up to and beyond its role in the 2016 US presidential election, with all the seismic consequences. It was WikiLeaks that published hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and senior Democratic officials, leading to claims that it was part of an alleged Kremlin plot to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.How WikiLeaks got the emails in the first place is an enduring mystery.Did someone drop them off to Assange on a flash drive? Were the files uploaded on to an encrypted remote server? Or did they come in by some other route?Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election, is looking for the answer. The secret records seen by the  and the magazine Focus Ecuador may give him important new clues.According to the documents, the counter-espionage effort began nearly six years ago when a team secretly installed CCTV cameras in the Ecuadorian embassy. They covered the entrance lobby, a meeting room and the mini-balcony from which Assange would periodically address supporters. The agents filmed everyone who came in and out, and kept watch on the street.Security personnel worked two-person shifts and were on duty 24 hours a day. They do not appear to have recorded Assange’s conversations, documents suggest. However, they were able to observe him closeup, noting his moods, habits and sleeping patterns.Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since August 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.None of this came cheap.The documents set out how Ecuador’s intelligence agency, known as Senain, hired an international security company. Its bill in 2012 was $55,000 (£40,000) a month, paid from a “special expenses” government budget.They detail how the company’s agents slept 100 metres (330ft) away from the embassy, in a multi-tenant Edwardian mansion block in Basil Street. Unbeknown to Ecuadorian taxpayers, the operatives were camping out in one of the most expensive parts of London, albeit in a basic basement flat with two bedrooms, which cost £2,800 a month.From a control room, the security team oversaw Assange’s contacts. They consulted with him about anyone wanting to visit. If he agreed, guests were allowed in. They were met in the foyer, went through a security check, and handed over their passports and mobile phones.The documents show that operatives wrote down passport numbers, nationalities and the purposes of the visits. These included “social reunion”, “medical”, “legal” or “VIP”. They clocked when the guest arrived and when they exited, in the early months past a phalanx of armed police waiting in uniform on the embassy’s front steps. At the beginning of the crisis, when the small Andean nation was facing off against the might of the British state, officers lurked on the interior stairs and next to the embassy toilet. Every month, the security company sent a confidential list of Assange’s visitors to the Ecuadorian president. There were additional “extraordinary” reports. Sometimes, the company included stills from secret video footage of interesting guests, plus profiles and analysis. They also reported when a packet of sweets was lobbed on to the balcony, seemingly a present for Assange. It is these visitor logs that will interest Mueller. He is reportedly close to indicting Russian hackers allegedly behind the raid on the Democrats’ electronic servers and seems to view WikiLeaks as an integral part of the Kremlin’s multifaceted espionage operation. The FBI has interviewed at least one source close to Operation Guest, it is understood.Assange has refused to say how the emails got to WikiLeaks. He denies they came from a “state actor”. The FBI does not appear to believe him. Giving evidence last year, the agency’s then director, James Comey, told Congress that Moscow was behind the DNC cyber-raid. An “intermediary”, he said, passed the emails to WikiLeaks.Assange’s relationship with Moscow is certainly longstanding. In 2011, he signed a deal with the Kremlin-owned television network RT. The Julian Assange Show featured 10 guests, including Correa. Weeks after Assange’s interview with Correa was broadcast, the Australian sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy.The logs record that Assange had more than 80 visitors in one month in 2016. They included the WikiLeaks staff member Sarah Harrison and longtime supporters such as Craig Murray, the UK’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan. Another was the Croatian philosopher Srećko Horvat.There were also visits from Assange’s lawyer Gareth Peirce and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club, who hosted WikiLeaks at his Norfolk mansion for 13 months up until Assange jumped bail. On 23 June 2016, RT broadcast a referendum special from inside the embassy, with the final guests leaving at 4.30am.The external surveillance team wrote up descriptions of these encounters. They were sent back to Senain and Correa, sources say. The then Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, visited Assange in London, talking with him into the early hours, and criticised Britain for failing to find a solution to the standoff. The UK was unmoved. Asked what the government planned to do about Assange, the then foreign minister, Hugo Swire, said: “Not my stone, not my shoe.”Correa had no immediate comment on the operation. He has previously decried the UK’s attempts to arrest Assange, saying his country would not tolerate “colonialism of any kind”. Meanwhile, leaked invoices show the Ecuadorian government spent as much as $28m on surveillance equipment, sold only to states. What it was used for and by whom is unclear.By 2014, it appears tensions over Assange were growing. The documents reveal that Ecuador’s then ambassador to the UK, Juan Falconí Puig, forwarded a complaint to Senain after a bill arrived for unpaid council tax from Kensington and Chelsea. The tax was payable on the agents’ clandestine flat in Basil Mansions. Falconí had no idea it existed. He rang Patiño, demanding to know what was going on, according to sources in Quito.That autumn, the security consultants reported that Assange had somehow set up his own secret communications network. Moreover, they said he had “violated” the embassy’s computers and was apparently reading confidential diplomatic traffic, the company reported. Embassy staff apparently kept their personal files on Assange in a safe – the one place he could not access.The head of Ecuadorian intelligence, Rommy Vallejo, held a meeting with Patiño to discuss the Assange situation and the “risks” he posed to embassy staff. Over time, Assange came to take up more than one-third of the embassy’s ground-floor space. Initially, he slept in narrow room next to the balcony. He subsequently colonised a back room as a bedroom and occupied half the kitchen. Assange’s unkempt realm was home to WikiLeaks and its computers, and was entirely private. There was no CCTV. It was off limits to diplomats, the rooms only accessible via special codes.Patiño brushed off these concerns. His solution to this internal takeover was to dispatch three undercover intelligence officers from Quito to increase security, documents show. The Assange bill was already causing friction with Ecuador’s financial chief. The new state agents cost an extra $35,000 a month, paid out on top of the security company’s monthly invoice, which had climbed to $97,000.Documents show the private security team’s duties included keeping an eye on Hans Crescent, the street outside the embassy. It reported demonstrations in support of Assange, noting that they became smaller each year. There was a strange visit by an American superfan who spent two days outside the embassy sleeping in a car. Protesters who took part in an anti-Correa demonstration were surreptitiously photographed. One one occasion, the team sent back images of a young man in a suit whom they deemed suspicious. Much of their job involved monitoring British police officers stationed outside. Scotland Yard later scaled back its presence outside the embassy and withdrew officers altogether in 2017, when Sweden dropped its investigation into alleged sexual offences, which Assange has always denied.In November 2017, the team filed an “extraordinary” 10-page report on a visit by two Catalan separatists, Oriol Soler and Andreu Grinyó. The meeting might “trigger criticism” from Madrid if it leaked, they concluded. Assange tweeted that same day in support of Catalan secession.Over time, Ecuador’s counter-espionage operation became mundane. In January, the agents noted that a new cleaner had started work. Typically, Assange would hold private conversations in the women’s bathroom, they wrote in a daily log. Visitors noticed that he used a “squelch box”, a counter-surveillance device that emitted a loud sound.Letters arrived for him, as did flowers, the agents noted. The flowers were thrown away “according to protocol”. Sometimes, Assange smoked a pipe. His mood was generally placid. On occasion, there were angry eruptions, sympathetically interpreted by the agents who could understand his frustration after being in the embassy for such a long time. The agents faithfully recorded visits from Bolivia’s former foreign minister, as well as such high-profile guests as Pamela Anderson, Vivienne Westwood and Yanis Varoufakis. Early this year, Assange’s most frequent visitor was the legal analyst Stella Morris, a member of his legal team.Journalists and film-makers have been frequent guests. They included the ’s Ewen MacAskill, who visited twice in January and February to discuss Assange’s confinement and his prospects for the future.In February, there were no more visits recorded for two weeks. This barren spell was marked across a line as “sin visitas”.Friends conceded that after almost six years in the embassy, Assange was visibly suffering, and in poor health, although they described him as mentally robust. At weekends, embassy staff go home, leaving him with no one to talk to apart from a solitary guard.The logs do not explain how WikiLeaks received the 70,000 Democratic emails that had been hacked.By the spring of this year, developments in Quito had moved in an ominous direction for Assange. Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, pronounced him a costly “inherited problem” and made it clear that he viewed Assange as an obstacle to better relations with the US.As a candidate, Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks when it revealed embarrassing Democratic party secrets. When Assange released the email correspondence of the Clinton aide John Podesta, Trump exclaimed: “I love WikiLeaks.” Before and after the election, Donald Trump Jr exchanged a handful of direct Twitter messages with Assange.Seemingly, the Trump White House changed its view when Wikileaks dumped out classified CIA hacking tools. The agency’s then director, Mike Pompeo, who was later made secretary of state, dubbed WikiLeaks a “hostile intelligence service”.In March, Assange’s internet access was cut off. A jammer was installed to prevent him from accessing emails. For more than a month, he has been forbidden visitors. Friends say he is passing the time by reading. They say he is leafing through books on the US election, which WikiLeaks did so much to influence and – its critics allege – subvert. Meanwhile, Correa, Assange’s protector and patron, has moved to Belgium. He has since landed at job at RT.Last week, the embassy appeared deserted. Nearby, well-heeled passengers emerged from Bentleys and Mercedes outside Harrods. Six supporters held banners that said “Free Assange” and #ReconnectJulian. A violinist serenaded him from the pavement. There was no sign of the guest, but the window next to his balcony was open.Assange faces a tough choice. If he walks out of the embassy, he can expect arrest and could spend up to a year in prison for breaking his bail conditions.The US might then seek to extradite him. He would contest any attempt, and might win, but would face a long, uncomfortable spell behind bars while his case is decided.Ecuadorian government sources say Quito is considering a plan for where Assange might go next. Russia would be an obvious choice, though this would cause problems with the US. Cuba and Venezuela are also said to be under discussion. Since January, Assange has officially been an Ecuadorian diplomat. However, this probably would not stop the UK arresting him if it had the chance.If Assange remains in the embassy, cut off from the world, WikiLeaks cannot function.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienNearly three-quarters of monitored Irish bathing waters are of “excellent” standard but there is evidence of deterioration in coastal areas around Dublin, where five of 15 monitored beaches are classified as “poor”.The latest Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Bathing Water Quality in Ireland report for 2017 classifies 132 of 142 identified waters as meeting strict EU standards, which provide a high level of protection for bathers.A total of 102 beaches and bathing waters were “excellent” the same number as in 2016. However, seven coastal bathing waters failed to meet the minimum standard and are “vulnerable to pollution events” – five are in Dublin (Merrion Strand, Sandymount Strand, Loughshinny, Portrane and Rush South), and two in Galway (Clifden and Ballyloughane).Sandymount joined the “poor” list after being classified of “sufficient” quality in 2015 and 2016. Over the past four years, nine of the 15 bathing waters in Dublin have shown deterioration in water quality.Andy Fanning, programme manager of the EPA Office of Evidence and Assessment, said: “Our assessment shows urban beaches are under greater pressure than those in more rural locations. More needs to be done to eliminate sources of bacterial contamination that are particular to urban locations.“The main issues are misconnections to surface water drains and other run-off from urban environments, together with sewage discharges. Work is needed by local authorities, Irish Water, businesses and homeowners to ensure that contaminated wastewater is correctly collected and treated before being released into the environment.”Relevant local authorities, with Irish Water, had plans in place to tackle the main pollution risks at these beaches with a view to improving them to at least “sufficient” quality, he said.Dublin Bay, a United Nations-designated biosphere of international significance, is an important habitat for seabirds, wildlife and aquatic species “despite pressures including the country’s largest port and wastewater works”.Like all waters close to major European cities, the main pollution threats are sewage discharges, contaminated surface streams, birds and other animals, the report states.Dublin’s difficulties are compounded by almost a quarter of Ireland’s population living in or around the capital, while several beaches in Fingal are at risk of pollution from sewage and surface streams, especially after heavy rainfall.Seabird droppings, which have as much as 10 million E.coli bacteria per gram, are a particular threat where large numbers of birds are present, notably at Merrion and Sandymount beaches.The 142 identified bathing waters are either coastal or inland waters widely used by the public for bathing and are monitored, managed and assessed under the requirements of the 2008 Bathing Water Quality Regulations. All nine monitored lakes achieved “excellent” or “good” classifications.From 2018, three new beaches are designated for protection under the bathing water regulations: Dooey and Magheroarty (Co Donegal), and Seafield Quilty (Co Clare)."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Polls apart: \u0026lsquoI hope you don\u0026rsquot get to kill many\u0026rsquo \u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore both definite Yes voters\u0026rsquoVicky Phelan and Stephen Teap to appear before Public Accounts CommitteeReprieve director calls on Northern Irish Assembly to investigate Donaldson companySeventeen obstetricians wrote to Dr Boylan saying his position as chairman was incompatible with advocating on the issueSimon Harris\u0026rsquos proposals are just the latest in a never-ending series of reformsSeven coastal bathing waters \u0026lsquovulnerable to pollution\u0026rsquo fail to meet minimum standardBeaches fail to meet EU standards due to surface pollution and sewage dischargesFG\u0026rsquos Eithne Loftus takes issue with way Aiken Promotions planned Phoenix Park showsDoctors told of limits on applying policy for screening services with \u0026lsquoinherent error rate\u0026rsquoSF says mandatory open disclosure on patient safety incidents vital to changing health service cultureProject at Morrison\u0026rsquos Island criticised over loss of parking spaces and public accessDUP says staying in union is \u0026lsquoclearly best\u0026rsquo for North but Sinn F\u0026eacutein calls for voters to have their saySolicitor urges Taoiseach to clarify how State will take over women\u0026rsquos cases against US labsSuperValu and Centra to introduce compostable cups, lids suitable for brown binsRetired obststrician and barrister argued for No side during RT\u0026Eacute referendum broadcastHSA and Garda investigate incident in which Pat O\u0026rsquoConnor died in Co ClareT\u0026aacutenaiste says negotiations under way for EU citizenship for NI citizens post-BrexitAirline says changes introduced to give paying customers more time to select seatsTD claims no-fault compensation system should be introduced after cancer scandal"},{"url":null,"title":"barnier on brexit ireland has the full support of all european states","story":"  April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by June   April 30, 2018DUP leader Arlene Foster says Barnier does not understand unionist culture   April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator says preparations must be made for no agreement on visit to Border area   May 1, 2018EU\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiator presses British for rapid agreement as DUP raises temperature   May 1, 2018Varadkar and Barnier put further pressure on UK to suggest detailed border solutions   May 7, 2018Key allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreed "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496627.1526413720!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dr peter boylan stands over claim on support for repeal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dr Peter Boylan, chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: said he is ‘standing up for Irish women and getting them the proper treatment’. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDr Peter Boylan has strongly defended an assertion that a clear majority of members of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists support repeal of the Eight Amendment.Dr Boylan is the chairman of the institute and has also been a leading campaigner for the Yes vote.He has repeatedly said that the 80 per cent of institute members back repeal.This week an internal row has emerged as to whether Dr Boylan’s views are representative of the institute. Seventeen obstetricians based in the south and south west wrote to Dr Boylan saying his position as chairman was incompatible with advocating on the issue.The obstetricians, based in Cos Cork, Tipperary and Kerry, wrote that as the “public face” of the institute he should refrain from public advocacy. The letter said Dr Boylan should “temporarily stand aside as chairperson” if he wished to continue to campaign.The letter said the view of its signatories was that the institute should reflect the ersity of opinion by not campaigning on either side.Dr Boylan, a former master of the National Maternity Hospital, responded that he was being asked to stand aside at a time “he was standing up for Irish women and getting them the proper treatment”.He said the letter was rushed out to the media before he got a hard copy of it. “Now that is playing dirty,” he said.The assertion that four-fifths of obstetricians in the institute back repeal has been challenged by some obstetricians campaigning for a No vote, and by the Love Both campaign.Dr Boylan told The  yesterday that 18 or 19 members of the institute’s national executive had backed repeal at a meeting which specifically discussed the referendum earlier this year.He also referred to a Survey Monkey form which was distributed to all members of the institute, seeking their views on the referendum and on its related proposals for reform. He said that 79 or 80 members responded, of whom 81 per cent supported repeal.According to its website, the institute has “close to 200 members, who are experienced consultant obstetriciansgynaecologists and leading experts in their fields”.Dr Trevor Hayes, an obstetrician campaigning for a No vote, last night contended the institute was more ided on the issue than the results of the survey indicated.He said that there was a tight timeframe to respond to the survey and added he did not believe its findings were representative of the institute as a whole. He based this on his view that fewer than half of its members had responded.Dr Hayes said Dr Boylan was a highly respected obstetrician but he should not be campaigning as chairman of the institute as he was “taking a solo run”.Love Both spokeswoman Dr Cora Sherlock said the letter from obstetricians was “an indication that he does not speak for all professionals involved in the care of pregnant women in Ireland”.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496700.1526417008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish unity polarised response to may comment on border poll","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tComments attributed to British prime minister Theresa May’s about a Border poll are an admission that a referendum on Irish unity should be called, Sinn Féin has said. Photograph: Simon DawsonPoolEPA..Comments attributed to British prime minister Theresa May’s about a Border poll are an admission that it is time for a referendum on Irish unity, Sinn Féin has said. The Times on Tuesday reported an exchange between Ms May and Tory back bencher Jacob Rees-Mogg at a party meeting. A source was quoted as saying Mr Rees-Mogg told those at the meeting he was in no doubt Northern Ireland would vote to remain in the UK in the event of a Border poll. According to the source, Ms May replied: “I would not be as confident as you. That’s not a risk I’m prepared to take. We cannot be confident on the politics of that situation, on how it plays out.” The Belfast Agreement says the Northern secretary shall exercise the power to direct the holding of a Border poll “if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland”. Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said if the reports were accurate, Ms May was “conceding that the Good Friday Agreement threshold for triggering a unity poll has been met”. Ms O’Neill also said it was “entirely unacceptable” that Ms May had reportedly indicated that she intends to actively prevent that from happening. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP said “this story is based on speculation” and the union is “clearly best for everyone living, working or raising a family in Northern Ireland”. He said Sinn Féin routinely failed to make a convincing arguments about removing Northern Ireland from the union and that a Border poll would be “isive and not helpful in building a shared society”. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party was “committed to delivering a new inclusive Ireland but recognises that there remains a body of work to be done to persuade unionism”. Mr Eastwood also said Ms May’s comments reflect the changing constitutional landscape facing these islands in the wake of Brexit. Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said “the union is secure and will grow stronger”. “I am absolutely confident that the case for the union would carry the day comfortably in any border poll,” he said. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said while his party respects everyone’s constitutional aspiration, “the priority today must be to agree a special deal for Northern Ireland to mitigate the risks from Brexit and to achieve the maximum cross-community support for such a pragmatic way forward”. Green Party leader Steven Agnew said all parties should “be focused on getting our devolved institutions back up and running so that we can tackle the crises in health and education”. People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said there is a “growing appetite” for a conversation about a Border poll and what a united Ireland could look like. TUV leader Jim Allister said he saw no indications that “anything approaching the statutory test” was being met”. “People know what side there bread is buttered being part of the world’s fifth largest economy rather than joining an EU dependent Irish republic,” he said.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA flying column of angels arrived at the gates of Leinster House just in time for Leaders’ Questions.They stayed outside. The Dáil is no place for angels, even if some of the politicians who inhabit it could give them lessons in how to dance on a pin.Large of feathery wing, they marched whiteously up Kildare Street and flapped into position near the wide pavement’s edge. The women formed a third line of silent protest in front of a back row of hugely magnified and luridly enhanced images of foetal remains. It was a strange scene.Representatives of a Tipperary-based group called the Irish Centre for Bioethical Reform (ICBR) – an offshoot of an American anti-abortion organisation – had lined up against the railings and put these giant banners on display.In front of them two young men held up a large rainbow flag, partially obscuring one graphic image. Two more beside them were shaking out what looked like a bedspread in advance of lifting it into position. Members of the Students Union of Ireland had hoisted a long banner in front of another blown-up print. Some Sinn Féin staffers came out and held up the letters Y-E-S, further eclipsing the repellent displays.And ahead of them stood the young women with the angel wings, wearing red “Repeal” hearts over their own hearts, further distracting from what was going on along the back wall.There has been a cat and mouse game around Dublin city in the past few weeks between the ICBR silent protesters and a stalking group of similarly silent protesters dedicated to blocking the abortion images they have been hawking around places like maternity hospital entrances.Back outside Leinster House, the anti-abortion campaigners also produced two smaller posters in an effort to thwart their determined adversaries. They started screwing aluminium rods together, like they were going to assemble a gazebo, until they had poles long enough to shove their bloodied images higher than everything else.“If this wasn’t so awful, it’d be very funny,” remarked one onlooker.What with the hoisting activities, the horrible images, the camouflaging efforts, the rosary beads women on the periphery, the earlier arrival of an amiable group of Grandfathers for Yes and the later turnout of angels, the photographers and TV camera people were delighted.Just over a week to go now to polling day. As TDs entered their penultimate week in the Dáil before the vote you could sense the atmosphere becoming a little more strained, emotions a little more heightened.There was much talk around the corridors about the previous night’s referendum debate on Claire Byrne Live, the conduct of which dismayed quite a few proponents of a Yes vote, who felt the anti-abortion panellists, with the help of very vocal and passionate supporters in the audience, had steamrollered their pro-choice opposition with a combination of confident answers and a crushingly combative style.On the other side – and the Dáil has a very substantial number of TDs who do not support repeal – there seemed a definite change of mood. They had a pep in their step and radiated a quiet satisfaction.\u0026nbspOne of the main reasons the repealers were feeling sore was because they felt obstetrician Prof Peter Boylan was “taken out” of Monday night’s debate by what they perceived to be a concerted onslaught of criticism and contradiction from the anti-abortion side.On the other hand, Independent TD Mattie McGrath, a leading light of that campaign, was not letting up on the charge started on television the night before. He also zoned in on the what he called inaccurate claims by medical experts, referencing a call by a number of doctors in the SouthSouthwest Hospital Group for Prof Boylan to step aside from his position as chairman of the Institution of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.He said that for the past two weeks two of the country’s senior medical professionals have been “endlessly repeating dangerous and reckless comments” in the referendum debate but “the Taoiseach will not stand up to them because they support his view in the upcoming referendum”.For his part, Leo Varadkar said he had hoped the debate would not become personalised, and until now it had remained largely respectful.“I deeply regret that some people have now chosen to try to personalise the campaign in regard to Dr Peter Boylan. Dr Boylan has the right to his view, just as doctors or former judges on the No side have the right to their view.”McGrath took umbrage at “a grossly offensive” remark by the Taoiseach last week where he said people who oppose repealing the Eighth Amendment were “turning a cold shoulder” to victims of sexual violence. This, he declared, was untrue and unfair.Varadkar noted how McGrath raised the issue of care and compassion, saying he had yet to hear from anyone, including the aforementioned Deputy, about how they care for and show compassion for the victims of sexual violence he had just mentioned.Victims “such as a 13-, 14- or 15-year-old girl who may have been raped by her father, grandfather or uncle, and is bleeding and in pain. What answer does the Deputy offer her?”The independent TD for Tipperary didn’t really have one.“You have no right to lecture us. We have compassion. Many organisations and agencies which I support assist victims of sexual violence on an hourly basis. We want more compassion, not the taking away of the last vestige of support for the unborn child – not a foetus – in the womb. We wish to maintain life from conception to end of life.”But they don’t want her to have the choice to end that pregnancy.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496409.1526402324!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mixed reaction in cavan to pro choice canvassers from north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJade Farrelly of Cavan Pro Choice and Emma Wallace of Alliance for Choice, Belfast speak to Joe Doherty and Jackie O’Neill (with Ruby the dog) about a Yes vote in Cavan town. Photograph: Lorraine TeevanThe coach pulls away from St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast at 9.30am on Saturday, heading south. Those on board, 25 young women and men, are travelling with the Alliance for Choice to support repeal volunteers across the Border in Cavan.The accents on the bus are a mix of Irish, Northern Irish, Spanish, Australian and English. We pass just one banner on the journey through the North – facing the Border, it has a big freshly-painted red hand of Ulster and has “No Pope here” on it, ancient prejudice preparing for the future. But as the driver steers us through the steep and narrow streets of Clones we have time to survey the posters on every lamppost. There are a lot of foetuses begging from the womb to be saved by a No vote. Decidedly fewer posters urge a Yes and for women to be trusted.The chat on the journey is both personal and political. One woman, worried about going up garden paths, talks about her irrational fear of dogs, and tells a story about being attacked by one. “That’s a rational fear, then,” says the woman beside her. Someone else describes a conversation with her mother, who is anti-repeal. “She says it’ll lead to euthanasia,” she says. “She says I could have her put down.” Maria Guelbenzu is excited. “This is a historical moment,” she says. “I’m from Spain, but after 18 years Belfast is home.”For artist Laura O’Connor and adult education teacher Elaine Crory, Cavan used to be home. Both grew up here. “I’m mildly nervous,” says Crory. “But also excited. I’ve two wee girls at home in Belfast. I want change for them.” O’Connor’s new exhibition, Uncomfortable State exploring themes of Ireland as a woman’s experience of Ireland, is on at the Ballina Arts Centre in Co Mayo. “I don’t have a vote so it seems important to come back here and inform people,” she says. Cavan had a high vote in favour of the amendment in 1983.Alliance for Choice campaigns for reproductive rights in the North, and is part of pro-choice coalitions on an all-Ireland basis. The British 1967 Act was not extended to Northern Ireland, and prohibitive guidelines from Stormont in recent years all but shut down the availability of abortion in the North’s hospitals, where it used to be provided in strictly limited circumstances, including to women referred from the Republic. In the past year, funding has been made available for women to go to Britain for terminations, and there are means-tested travel grants.If the referendum is passed followed by the anticipated legislation it will have implications for women in the North. With a European E111 health form, they can avail of GP treatment in the Republic. Post-Brexit the situation is uncertain. “We aren’t doing this for ourselves,” says Danielle Roberts who is co-ordinating the cross-Border canvassing work. “This is about international human rights and solidarity.”Artists Jackie O’Neill and Joe Doherty with their nervous red setter, Ruby, are crossing Cavan’s featureless Market Square when the Northerners arrive in their high-viz “Vote Yes” jackets. “We’re both definite Yes voters,” says O’Neill. Doherty says it’s good to see the Belfast people. “The more awareness that’s raised the better,” he says. Cavan for Yes workers arrive with leaflets and plans.Terry Moore lives in rural Cavan and is worried. “There are priests saying that they aren’t telling people how to vote but that if they vote Yes they needn’t bother coming for communion,” she says.Adam Kelly is a final-year student at St Patrick’s Boys’ Secondary School and became a Yes supporter after hearing about women’s terrible experiences, including that of his great grandmother. He’s enthusiastic about a debate he and others have organised at the school, after anti-choice speakers were allowed in to give a talk. “What they said was heavy on emotion and light on facts,” he said. “One of my friends was going to vote No but after the talk he changed his mind – he’s a critical thinker.” Kelly got a lot of his classmates to register to vote.A retired trade unionist, Irene Donegan campaigned against the amendment in 1983. “There was a guy followed us around and when people opened their door to us he’d shout, ‘Don’t be talking to them – they’re murderers’. It was very trying.” This time around she says that most people want to discuss the issues. “A lot of women are talking about the cervical smear scandal too. They’re angry about it.”As Donegan takes some of the canvassers to her car to go out to the housing estates around the town, a woman she knows comes up to her angrily. “You might as well shoot a child in the street,” she says. “If you don’t want girls to get pregnant tell your daughters not to have sex. It’s not the baby’s fault.”Donegan says the woman is a settled Traveller who is trade unionist who has done great work for women. “The Travellers are voting No,” she says. “One Traveller man said to me, ‘get away from my house – you’re doing the devil’s work’.”The sun is shining on Swellan Lake and the estates around it is full of summer sounds, children playing, the hum of lawnmowers. A lot of people are out or don’t come to the door. At one house a middle-aged woman says she will vote Yes. “I just want fair play for women. It’s not right they have to go away,” she says. A young woman with her baby in her arms says she’ll vote No, but doesn’t want to talk about it. Her mother, the other woman’s sister, arrives. “I don’t know – I’ll decide on the day,” she says. At another house, a woman glares and puts the leaflet in the bin.One man says he and his wife have talked a lot about it. “I was one of those babies that was given no hope of survival,” he says. “And my son’s lungs collapsed at birth and he wasn’t expected to live – he’s inside there and he’s 10 now. But saying that, I think women should have the right to decide. I’ll vote Yes.” His neighbour takes the opposite view. “I hope you don’t get to kill many,” he says. “Hang your heads in shame.”A young man says he doesn’t have ovaries so he won’t be voting. Another young man says he probably won’t bother to vote at all this time. “Whatever the Government says, I’ll do the opposite,” he says. “What’s with these ones down from Belfast? Sure they’re from the occupied six counties. They can’t even vote.”A smiling man with a tea towel on his shoulder comes to the door. “You’ll have no bother getting Yes votes in this house,” he says. “I have teenage daughters. Work it out for yourselves.”The Northerners meet where the street becomes a country road. “The Cavan people said they had some huge estates for us to do,” says Roberts. “I think their idea of a huge estate must be a bit different to ours.” Some of the canvassers say they had mostly positive experiences but O’Connor is a bit shaken. “A woman ran after me in the street with a book full of pictures of dismembered foetuses,” she says.Donegan comes to take us back to the bus. She sighs: “Ireland was never a great country for women and it still isn’t,” she says.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496683.1526417987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"top health officials knowledge of cervicalcheck policy revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer at the  Department of Health, is due to appear before the Oireachtas health committee today. Photograph: Eric LukeThe Government’s chief medical officer and other senior Department of Health officials had a deeper knowledge of the CervicalCheck policy on informing women affected by cancer test audits than previously known, newly released records show.The documents confirm the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and others were advised in October 2016 about CervicalCheck’s policy on informing women with cervical cancer that their cases had been the subject of an audit.Clinicians were told to use their judgment as to whether the outcome of the review should be communicated to patients and asked to consider whether the release of the information would do more harm than good.In cases where the woman had died, CervicalCheck said to “simply ensure” the result was recorded in the woman’s notes.This policy was made known to senior officials within the department, the documents confirm. They also reveal the department was informed of the potential of legal cases, including by a woman who subsequently died.It is the first time that the documents show discussions around open disclosure – HSE policy since 2013 – and about whether it should be followed when it came to telling affected patients about the outcome of the review into their cases.“While CervicalCheck supports the principles of open disclosure, it is recognised that there are limitations to its universal implementation, particularly for screening services where there is an inherent recognised error rate,” a note from June 29th, 2016 said.In draft letters prepared by CervicalCheck to the clinicians of the affected women, it was implied there was no obligation on the clinicians to disclose the information.Labour TD Alan Kelly said the documents confirmed there was an awareness in the department about the audit and its policy on the communicating the outcome.Mr Kelly also questioned the decision of Dr Holohan not to inform Minister for Health Simon Harris about these memos when the controversy first erupted two weeks ago.The same point was raised by Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Reilly, who said Dr Holohan was in receipt of vital information but chose to withhold it from the Minister. Dr Holohan and the secretary general of the Department, Jim Breslin are due to appear before the Oireachtas health committee on Wednesday.Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap are expected before the Public Accounts Committee at 5pm. Ms Phelan won a €2.5 million settlement after she received incorrect smear test results which failed to diagnose her with cervical cancer. Mr Teap’s wife Irene was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and died last year after two undisclosed false tests in 2010 and 2013.

Photograph: Korea Summit Press PoolAFPGetty ImagesNorth Korea has abruptly cancelled high-level talks with South Korea scheduled for Wednesday and placed a doubt over next month’s planned summit in Singapore between its leader Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump. Delegations from North and South had been due to meet on Wednesday in the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone separating the two countries. But North Korea’s Central News said Pyongyang had no choice but to suspend the talks, calling ongoing US-South Korean military exercises a “provocation”. In an ominous sign for the upcoming meeting between Mr Trump and his one-time foe Mr Kim, South Korea’s main news agency reported that North Korea had also threatened to cancel the June 12th summit with the US. The US “will have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned North Korea-US summit in light of this provocative military ruckus jointly conducted with the South Korean authorities,” South Korea’s Yonhap news agency quoted North Korea as saying. Addressing reporters shortly after the announcement, the spokeswoman for the US State Department said it had received no information from North Korea about plans to cancel the summit. “Kim Jong-un had said previously that he understands the need and the utility of the United States and the Republic of Korea continuing in its joint exercises,” Heather Nauert said, noting that the exercises were legal and planned well in advance. “We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between president Trump and Kim Jong-un.”The surprise cancellation of Wednesday’s meeting came less than 24 hours after Pyongyang had convened the talks, which aimed to build on the progress of the historic April 27th summit between Mr Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in. Delegations from North Korea and South Korea had been expected to travel to the demilitarised zone. The development comes after a period of unprecedented engagement between the US and North Korea. Last week, three US detainees who had been imprisoned in North Korea were released and secretary of state Mike Pompeo made his second visit to the North Korean capital in six weeks in preparation for next month’s summit. Satellite images appear to show that North Korea has begun closing its nuclear testing site at Punggye-ri. The foreign ministry said that it would invite journalists to witness the closing later this month.The so-called “Max Thunder” military drills are an aircraft-only series of drills conducted annually by US and South Korean forces, involving about 1,500 military personnel. About 23,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea and regularly partake in military drills with South Korean troops.Mr Trump has staked his foreign policy reputation on the forthcoming summit with North Korea, welcoming the apparent thaw in relations between the two countries. Mr Pompeo said over the weekend that the US would provide economic investment to North Korea if the country signed up to denuclearisation, though he stressed that this would involve “complete verifiable irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495798.1526376817!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea dismantling nuclear test site satellite imagery shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t North Korean leader Kim Jong-un discussing a nuclear weapons programme with officials  in a photograph released in  September 2017.  Photograph: KCNA via Reuters North Korea has already made considerable progress in dismantling its nuclear test site at Punggye-ri as promised, according to a report on the 38 North website that closely monitors activities in the North.“After initial reporting of plans to allow experts and media personnel to observe the closing of North Korea’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site . . . commercial satellite imagery from May 7th provided the first definitive evidence that dismantlement of the test site was already well under way,” the website said.Last month, North Korea said it would shut its nuclear test site and halt nuclear weapons testing and missile launches ahead of a planned meeting on June 12th between Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump. The 38 North website is one of the most respected monitors on North Korea. It is a programme of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University’s Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).The government said it would allow foreign journalists into North Korea next week to witness the dismantling of the facility.The safety of the Punggye-ri site has been a subject of concern and there had been reports that some areas of the test site have become unstable after the last nuclear test in September.The website said several key operational support buildings in the site had been razed since the last time it performed an analysis of the site.“Some of the rails for the mining carts, which had led from the tunnels to their respective spoil piles, have apparently been removed. Additionally, some carts seem to have been tipped over andor disassembled, and several small shedsoutbuildings around the site had been removed,” 38 North said.Other buildings remain intact, and the tunnel entrances appear to remain open ahead of the final ceremony next week, it said.The final closure ceremony would involve the “collapsing all of its tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances, and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts”.The Koreas are due to hold high-level talks in the peace village of Panmunjom on the southern side of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) iding them on Wednesday.The North will send a 29-member delegation for the discussions, led by Ri Son-kwon, who chairs the North’s reunification agency.Also in the delegation will be Kim Yun-hyok, vice railroad minister, and Won Kil-u, vice sports minister, along with journalists.The delegation from the South will be lead by unification minister Cho Myoung-gyon. The delegation be composed of about five officials, but the final list has yet to be determined.It’s the first time that senior officials from both Koreas will face each other since the April 27th summit between South Korean president Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim.Separately, Japanese media reported that senior level officials from the ruling Workers Party of North Korea had visited Beijing. As North Korea’s only major ally, China is keen to maintain a high-profile role in the efforts to secure peace in the region and make sure the US does not use the opportunity to leverage greater influence."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Majority of United Nations members criticise Israel\u0026rsquos response to protests in GazaPalestinians mark \u0026lsquoNakba\u0026rsquo, Israeli minister is unconcerned about prospect of war crimesMinister says 20 people managed to swim to safety after incident on Godavari riverKilling of Palestinians after diplomatic steps may derail US\u0026rsquos professed peace amibitionsOne Palestinian killed on Tuesday as far smaller numbers protest on \u0026lsquoNakba\u0026rsquoCoveney should have told envoy to \u0026lsquopack his bags\u0026rsquo in wake of Gaza violence, says DohertyMany young protesters acted in desperation against a backdrop of impoverished livesPalestinian officials say 1,200 injured, 450 by live fire, as US embassy opens in JerusalemIsraeli bullets and bloodshed in Gaza as Palestinians insist they \u0026lsquohave to fight\u0026rsquoViolence and Palestinian deaths are result of lack of strategic vision in US foreign policySome 100 singing demonstrators block thoroughfare in front of Trump hotelPreliminary poll results show setback for prime minister Haider al-AbadiIraqis vote in first election since defeat of Islamic State militants inside the countryTwo \u0026lsquodays of rage\u0026rsquo declared by Palestinians on when they plan to breach the borderRuqayeh (75) was five when shelling forced her from her village.

Photograph: Matt CardyGetty ImagesIn the House of Commons on Tuesday, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry teased Boris Johnson over his role in the cabinet’s split over Britain’s future customs relationship with the EU.“May I begin by thanking the foreign secretary for leading our cross-party efforts over the last two weeks to destroy the prime minister’s ‘customs partnership’ proposal? I trust that he finished off the job earlier this morning. Unfortunately, however, that leaves us with his own crazy Mad Max – I mean max fac – proposal,” she said.Johnson responded by describing Labour’s position on the customs union as “absolutely clouded in obscurity”. But there is no obscuring the tangle Theresa May has found herself in as she seeks to unite her party behind a single position which can be reconciled with her promise to avoid a hard border in Ireland. During a meeting with Conservative backbenchers on Monday, May is reported to have slapped down Jacob Rees-Mogg after the arch-Brexiteer suggested that Britain should simply keep the Border open after Brexit and dare Dublin to install infrastructure at the EU’s behest. May told him that EU rules obliged Ireland to protect the single market and customs area and warned that his approach could antagonise moderate nationalist opinion in Northern Ireland.If Rees-Mogg was chastened, he showed no sign of it in an opinion piece in Tuesday’s Daily  in which he urged the prime minister not to take Brussels too seriously on the Border. He accused Brussels of playing up the issue to win further concessions from Britain and complained that Irish politicians such as Simon Coveney were using “inflammatory, unhelpful rhetoric” for domestic political reasons.“The Irish Government needs to understand that if it obliges us to choose between the Republic and the Union, we will choose the Union,” he wrote.May has tasked two groups of ministers to work out how each of the two customs options could be made to work. Brexiteers have until now shown no sign of weakening in their resistance to the customs partnership and the talk around Westminster is of “max fac plus delay”. This would see Britain remaining in the customs union beyond the end of the post-Brexit transition period at the end of 2020 until the arrangements are in place at its borders to make trade sufficiently frictionless.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495097.1526324307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"janan ganesh leavers prepare their brexit betrayal narrative","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg: his use of “cretinous”, along with Boris Johnson’s “crazy”, to describe Theresa May’s customs partnership ideas suggests the histrionics of ham actors. Photograph: Matt CardyGettySo nostalgic and moleskin-trousered by stereotype, Britain’s Eurosceptic right is actually mesmerised by technology. In the referendum campaign, Leavers espoused the power of digital communication to collapse geographic distance, and make India as viable an export market as France.Now, faced with the riddle of how to leave the customs union without compromising supply chains or peace along the Irish Border, they bank on unspecified inventions to finesse the problem over time.This vein of techno-optimism does not run through Brussels, where “maximum facilitation” has few supporters, or even London, where Theresa May, the prime minister, tries to sell colleagues on a simpler customs partnership with the EU. Such is the minutiae behind an intra-Conservative Party war fought in increasingly public view.The mystery is why, with a hardish Brexit so close, Leavers would choose to die in this particular ditch. The customs partnership would not prevent an independent British trade policy. Britain would have to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, but this seems a small nuisance next to the prize of exit. And if the technology really does emerge, partnership can be swapped for max fac later on.Yet Boris Johnson, whose survival as foreign secretary is a daily reproach to May’s judgment, calls her idea “crazy”. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP goes with “completely cretinous”. Ministers whom she has asked to war-game the policy will do so with clothes pegs on their noses and expressions of distaste.There is something forced, almost thespian, about their complaints. After all, their dream is near. Why imperil it? Leavers did not just win the referendum, but the interpretation of the result, too. Britain is leaving the customs union and the single market, despite the closeness of the vote and the ambiguity of its meaning. We have lived through the gradual normalisation of a type of exit that was held to be “hard” in the days after the referendum.May has been a gift to the Leavers. As a rookie prime minister, hemmed in by advisers who failed to last the course, it was she who drew the red lines that left little to negotiate with the EU. “Trust me,” she wrote in the Sunday Times last weekend, but they should trust her implicitly by now.Why, then, this struggle among Leavers to take yes for an answer? Perhaps it is sincere, and they read into the difference between max fac and customs partnership a significance that is worth delaying an exit deal for. But with various pressures against them – time, the House of Lords’ enthusiasm for the single market – a passionate Leaver would surely compromise at this stage.Which is why we must entertain a more cynical theory. A good number of Leavers do not want to be associated with the exit deal that Britain eventually strikes with the EU, whatever its content. To that end, they are inventing grievances. Disavowal of the agreement allows them to escape blame if economic life deteriorates after its implementation, or voters feel no compensating thrill of self-government. “If only we had left properly,” would serve as the Leavers’ defence against popular anger.The betrayal narrative writes itself. A cabinet resignation or two would help it along. Johnson’s behaviour is consistent with that of a man who wants to be fired. Having won the referendum as rebels, endorsement of the official deal would turn the Leavers into apologists for a new status quo overnight, with all its imperfections and disappointments. Not just MPs, but newspapers too, would have to explain away the non-materialisation of Shangri-La on British soil. Neither temperament nor experience equips them for life as pragmatic defenders of a flawed but liveable reality. They will do what they can to prevent the change in role.And if their vexatious complaints prevent any deal being agreed, then, for some of them at least, so much the better. A certain kind of Leaver has always loathed the idea of exit talks, as though European permission were needed, and hates even more the prospect of entanglement in budget payments, regulatory agencies and the like.If all this seems implausibly calculated, then remember what the alternative explanation is. You have to believe that people who have devoted their adult lives to the cause of EU exit would, on the brink of their dream’s orderly enactment, become immovable on the details of customs regimes that merited no mention before.I do not believe it. Even their language (“crazy”, “cretinous”) suggests the histrionics of a ham actor. Leavers demand everything from a Brexit deal except their names on the paper. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry meghan markles wedding cake royal bakes ages","story":"Meghan and Harry have chosen their wedding cake, and it is to be a celebration of spring a zingy, floral confection with firm nods to all of the current fashionable food preoccupations - seasonality, provenance and natural ingredients.

It would not comment further.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsPrince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesMs Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleDambusters raid: How the famous Second World War attack unfoldedNorth Korea takes aim at John Bolton as it threatens to scrap Trump summit over nuclear demandsMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease.

Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13There were 74 live births among the 405 women receiving acupuncture, compared to 72 births among the 404 women receiving the sham treatment – a birth rate of 18.3 per cent and 17.8 per cent respectively.While this was not statistically significant, the authors are working on a second paper to investigate the “psycho-social benefit” that appears to come from IVF.“Feeling relaxed and reporting relief from stress and women feeling good about themselves is to be welcomed for women as they undergo an IVF cycle,” said president of the Fertility Society of Australia and co-author of the paper, Professor Michael Chapman.Acupuncture comes from a branch of traditional Chinese medicines focused on inserting needles at key pressure points to realign qi, supposed energy flows in the body. Would-be parents being sold ‘false hope’ by overseas IVF clinicsIt is commonly used for chronic pain and other treatments without effective medical interventions.A typical session lasts up to an hour and can involve a prolonged discussion with the practitioner about the illness and underlying stress.Previously backers have said that as it is relatively cheap, costing around £50 to £70 for a single session and low risk, acupuncture could be a useful add on therapy if it helped improve birth rates with IVF – which costs thousands of pounds for a single cycle.The report comes after experts from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists criticised the cottage industry of non-evidence based add-on treatments that have sprung up around IVF.Professor Lesley Regan told a conference last month that women are being “bullied” into spending thousands on add-ons which clinics tell them will give the best chance of success.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr McAfee, who is best known for creating the eponymous antivirus software, has recently been involved with various cryptocurrency companies and was served with a subpoena by the SEC in 2016.John McAfee reveals why he charges over $100,000 for a single tweetWe are in a five vehicle motorcade, Mr McAfee told The Independent. All vehicles driven by ex-military special forces and filled to the brim with heavily-armed security personnel.More details about his problems with the SEC were given in the first video, posted from an unknown location and filmed on Monday evening.“The SEC was never intended to have this power, please God America, wake up and see what has happened,” Mr McAfee said. “The SEC is in charge of our entire industry, our companies, our manufacturing, our distribution, our creativity, our entrepreneurship. When it was created, in the wisdom of the creators, it had only civil powers. If it got p***ed off at you, it could sue you, end of story.“Now, with the cooperation of the justice department, the SEC can get involved, or bring people in who can punish you beyond a civil suit. The SEC owns America, please God, wake up people. And if you think that an agency of the US government would not stoop to assassination, kidnapping, threats, then what are you smoking?”https:t.co1LaXdqm5UfIn an email exchange with The Independent in April, Mr McAfee mentioned his concerns, saying: “I know that I’m in the crosshairs of the SEC.”Mr McAfee has previously claimed that violent cartels have attempted to kidnap him on several occasions over the last few years, most recently in September. Those attempts, he says, relate to his time in Belize when he was caught up in the investigation of the murder of his neighbour in 2012.As a result, Mr McAfee lives with armed security guards at his heavily fortified home in Lexington, Tennessee.The SEC made us fear Ethereum because Bitcoin was so obviously just a currency and out of their realm. They want to crush crypto, so the only way to scare us is to frown at Ethereum. The legal field is clear: Fish will ride bicycles before Etheteum could be called a security.His latest fears of kidnapping relate to his involvement with cryptocurrency, which he says is a threat to the power wielded by the SEC and the financial elite.In an interview with his business associate Rob Loggia, Mr McAfee said his public advocacy of cryptocurrency has made him a target. “The SEC wants to destroy a revolution – a movement of the people – by making an example out of me,” Mr McAfee said. “I cannot allow that to happen.In the final video posted on Tuesday, Mr McAfee explained his views on the government agency.“We have a pyramidal power system that is corrupt at the core,” Mr McAfee said. “You think the SEC has no power, but every single major industry and business in America is under the thumb of the SEC.“The SEC is one of the most powerful agencies in the world. It is out of hand, and it does not anymore represent American values or the American people.”The SEC did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent. The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

The information is frequently used by parties and candidates to examine patterns and target voters in specific areas.Elaine Swords who along with her husband received the letters over the weekend, told Lancasteronline: “I just feel uncomfortable about the whole thing. Although she acknowledged the information was on the public record, she said “but as far as having it sent in the mail like this, I don’t think that’s right.”Republicans scramble to explain Democrat lead in Pennsylvania electionShe also pointed out that some of the information in the letters appeared to be wrong. Some of the “neighbours” listed, appear to be people who live in distant towns and for the 2016 primary record, the letter states it was held in March 2016, when in fact it was held on 26 April.This year, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf is running for his second term. The vote is uncontested, but the ballot will include three Republicans voters can choose between to challenge Mr Wolf.Voters can also cast ballots for the state’s Lieutenant Governor, as well as for candidates for several seats in the US Senate and the House of Representatives. The Pennsylvania Department of State has said it is looking into the letters.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqi are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party.

It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies. They are aspirational hard-workers, who want a home to call their own. Many are the people Mrs May once called those “Just About Managing”.House reforms are vital for the future of the Tory Party.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MPs have voted twice to reject a backward-looking, disproportionate and costly Leveson 2 inquiry.We would now urge the House of Lords to respect the wishes of the elected House.The Government win came after Culture Secretary Matt Hancock vowed to carry out a regular review of how the media handles sensitive data in a last-ditch attempt to head off a Commons rebellion.He also said ministers would act if the press self-regulation regime appeared to stop working well in future.Mr Hancock told MPs: “We have gone out of our way to offer concessions at every stage to make sure the system of press regulation is both free and fair.What we propose with this set of amendments is that this house can continue to debate and scrutinise the effectiveness of the self-regulation of the press, without requiring statutory regulation which we seek to avoid.Now is the time to look forward, not back and come together to build a vibrant, free and fair press that holds the powerful to account and rises to the challenges of our time.He was speaking after the House of Lords last night voted to hold a re-run of the Leveson Inquiry even though it had already been rejected by the Commons.Peers decision to back a controversial amendment to the Data Protection Bill meant that MPs had to vote again even though theyd already rejected the plans.Last week, the Commons narrowly voted against an almost identical amendment, proposed by ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband.But the margin of victory was just nine votes - raising hopes among anti-press campaigners that they could win over enough MPs to change the result second time around.Mr Hancocks last-minute offer of a new amendment enshrining regular reviews of the media was designed to convince the Commons there is no need for a full-blown inquiry which could drag on for years.It seemed to work - as the Governments winning margin increased from nine votes to 12.Speaking as MPs debated this afternoon, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said anti-press campaigners only wanted to get even with the media by holding a Leveson re-run.Tory MP Peter Bone - one of five Conservative rebels in last week’s vote - switched sides in today’s vote.He suggested that it was wrong for the Lords to defy the wishes of the Commons because Theresa May vowed not to hold a “Leveson 2” inquiry in her election manifesto last year.The only Tory rebels today were veteran Ken Clarke, Crispin Blunt and Philip Hollobone, as Dominic Grieve chose to abstain rather than opposing the Government.Senior backbencher John Redwood said in the Commons that the peers’ vote was “rather undemocratic”, adding: “They dont like results of referendums, they dont like the EU Withdrawal Bill... and now they want to regulate the press because the press points out the errors of their ways.”The Lords vote came despite senior peers warning their colleagues they risked undermining Britain’s tradition of the free press by holding a re-run of the inquiry.VOTED IN FAVOUR OF LEVESON 2 (291)Diane Abbott (Labour - Hackney North and Stoke Newington)ABSTAINED IN TODAYS VOTE (44)Ian Austin (Labour, Dudley North) - PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED LEVESON 2(Note: those abstaining includes MPs unable to vote because they are absent or ill. Does not include the Speaker and three Deputy Speakers, who dont vote, or seven Sinn Fein MPs, who refuse to take their seats.)Viscount Colville said: “Even the prospect of the bar being raised will have a chilling effect on investigative journalism.”And Lord Hunt added: “I suspect what lies behind this amendment is yet another attempt to exercise some statutory controls or levers over our free media.”The House of Lords will technically be able to push the Leveson 2 amendment again when the bill returns from the Commons - but it is highly unlikely they will seek to defy MPs for a second time.Despite being a well-paid columnist until last year, he hates newspapers for revealing he had an affair using his government-owned flat.LORD KERSLAKE: The former head of the civil service now advises Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, but press revealed he was nicknamed “Bungalow Bob” by staff as there was “not much upstairs.”Never far from the headlines after his bungling in Whitehall and later as an NHS Trust chief.PETER HAIN:The Labour arch-remoaner was forced to resign as Transport Secretary in 2008 in a scandal about undeclared donations from rich donors.He was left red faced after he put an expensive new roof for his “log store” on his expenses.LORD MENDELSOHN:The Labour big-hitter was forced to quit the frontbench in January after the press revealed he attended the controversial President’s Club Ball.Female waitresses were groped and harrassed at the all-male charity dinner that rocked the City.LORD MACLEAN:The former Tory whip led the charge to have MPs exempt from Freedom of Information laws when he was in the Commons.And he was a key player in trying to block the publication of MPs expenses ahead of the devastating 2009 scandal.BARONESS CHAKRABARTI: Corbynista peer Shami was accused of whitewashing antisemitism in the Labour Party in a duff report published shortly before she was ennobled.Exposed as a hypocrite for sending her son to £18,000-per-year private school after attacking grammar schools for being unfair."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tp-graphic-unemployment-rate.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"employment rate soars to record high as wages pace ahead of inflation","story":"The number of people out of work dropped 46,000 to 1.42million, latest Office for National Statistics figures revealed yesterday.Employment is also at the highest since records began in 1971 with 75.6 per cent in a job.Numbers in work rose 179,000 to 32.34million, with 2,000 people finding work each day.The plunge in unemployment - to just 4.2 per cent - comes as the number of EU nationals working in the UK fell for the first time in eight years.In the three months to March there were around 2.29million EU workers — down 28,000 on the same period last year.The drop was fuelled by 91,000 workers leaving from eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004, such as Poland and Hungary.The net number of Brits employed rose 417,000 to a record 28.73million.Experts said it was too early to say if Brits were finding jobs due to fewer migrants. Pro-EU campaign groups warned of a Brexodus brain drain.But Alp Mehmet, of Migration Watch, said: “There are tentative signs that businesses may be turning to the domestic workforce.”Average earnings excluding bonuses also rose by 2.9 per cent — outstripping inflation.Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “Growth in real wages means people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets.”The Resolution think tank warned pay was still around £730 a year lower than a decade ago.But Gerard Lyons, chief economist at NetWealth, said the “great” job figures showed how wrong Remain campaigners had been with their warnings about how a Brexit vote would cripple the economy.He said: “Project Fear’s warnings look more ridiculous by the day.”Official figures yesterday showed the employment rate among 16 to 64-year-olds was 80 per cent for the first time since 1991.The Office for National Statistics said more blokes than ever were working beyond traditional retirement age, with 731,000 over-65s clocking on.A record 71.2 per cent of working age women have a job, the ONS added.

There could be a little bit of mist early on but that will burn off relatively quickly.The main uncertainty is cloud cover, with fair weather cloud developing through the afternoon - its temperature driven.At the moment the average temperature looks like 19C to 20C (68F) but up to 23C is possible.The amount of sunshine and cloud cover will determine whether we get those upper temperatures.Most of

a poll of 1,500 adults revealed partners are most likely to be in the circle of trust, along with parents and siblings.It also emerged we turn to the trusted inner circle for help or support at least twice a month.The study was commissioned by American Express to celebrate the launch of its new brand campaign and understand more about how the support of others can help propel you forward.Digital entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, who is working with American Express on the launch of its new campaign, said: “Having the support of others can be instrumental to success, but it’s not always about having friends in high places.Support can come from anywhere and more often than not it’s people you’ve known all your life.’’The study also found for nearly half of Brits (47 per cent) this social support network has become more important today than ever before.More than a third put this down to busier lives while 28 per cent blamed an increased pressure to succeed.According to the data, Brits believe having a support network around you is one of the most important factors to self-achievement.Additionally, the research identified the support network is primarily made up of a “backer” (64 per cent), a “comforter” (62 per cent) and a “cheerleader” (62 per cent).It also consists of a “constructive critic” (45 per cent) and a “big picture thinker” (40 per cent).Jamal Edwards, who is also the founder of SBTV, a British company run by a small team of young people working on web-based content, added:  “I’ve relied on my parents more than anyone else.“They’ve helped back me on many occasions and given me the encouragement to get to where I am today.“For example, they bought me my first camera for Christmas when I was 15 which is when I really got into making videos and I became inseparable from the camera.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406342496.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds best engagement photos 2018","story":"The winning

peninsula.The pictures reveal the construction of everything from a pyramid-shaped hotel, luxury villas and even an artificial lake, according to experts at NK News.When the tourist area is built, it will satisfy the demand of domestic and foreign tourists, the state-run KCNA news agency said in a statement.It said the chosen location would be the ideal place to link various tourist destinations to the Wonsan international tourist zone.Now high-resolution photos from Skysat show the North Korean dictator is following through on his promise.Pictures from the ground show buildings tens of stories high, meaning the entire resort could house tens of thousands of people.Meanwhile time-lapse imagery suggests the work began almost immediately after Kims speech and has been carried out at a rapid pace.It shows temporary shelters and workers facilities springing up along the coast between January and February.Photos even show floodlights being erected all over the beach so construction can continue at night time.North Korean soldiers are often drafted in to work on such projects, according to NK news, which says the resort could be completed as early as March.With tourism one being one of the few industries not targeted by US sanctions, experts believe the resort is aimed at making money through tourism.Wonsan and Kalma airport are also important defence areas, used for large-scale artillery drills and as the launch site for dozens of missile tests in recent years.In April last year, Kim used the same beach near Wonsans new airport to unleash an artillery drill

Looking like a giraffe was found to be a turn-off too.That may not come as a surprise to 6ft 7in Crouchie, 37, who nonetheless is married to model Abbey Clancy, 32.When he was once asked what he would be if he were not a footballer, he quipped: “A virgin.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Two Home Secretaries, the Immigration Minister and officials claimed they didn’t know there had been any wrongful deportations.“Last week they claimed there were only a handful – now we find out that it’s at least 63 – and that’s only Windrush cases.”The confession follows weeks spent by Home Office officials suggesting no Windrush-era immigrants had been wrongly deported.The scandal exploded into light last month when Commonwealth leaders slammed Downing Street for refusing them a meeting with Theresa May over the crisis during the Commonwealth Summit.Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary after mistakenly telling the Home Affairs Select Committee the Home Office didn’t use immigration removal targets.Mr Javid yesterday said the department was now investigating a potential 4,482 Windrush cases, where citizens needed to be given a permanent leave to remain. So far just 526 have been given the necessary documents.The new Home Secretary also risked a backlash from Theresa May by saying he wouldn’t be using the term “hostile environment” that she adopted in her spell at the Home Office – saying the term hostile was “unBritish”.He separately hinted a new policy paper on post-Brexit immigration could be brought forward to as early as July.Last night Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott demanded justice for the Windrush generation.She blasted: “The hostile environment created by Theresa May has led to illegal deportations of lawful citizens.“Their lives have been potentially destroyed and uprooted because of this Government’s immigration policies.“Apologies and empty words of sympathy are not enough to undo the damage and great pain that has been caused to an entire community.”Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said there were still many unanswered questions over Windrush.She added: “It is shocking to find that 63 people may have been wrongly removed or deported and troubling that they have not yet been contacted.“It was also significant that the Home Secretary admitted they have no way of knowing either how many Windrush cases may have lost their homes and jobs.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You will see thousands of police as you approach the stadium.“You will be walking down avenues of police with shields, helmets and guns.”Chief Inspector Joseph Stokoe, of the Met Police and head hooligan spotter in Russia, added : “People need to be aware that the numbers of police and military that you will see at games will frankly be off the scale as to what you see in the UK.”British police say the chances of violence at matches will be “remote.”Football policing boss Mr Roberts said : “Russia is committed to providing a safe haven and a festival of football.“Notwithstanding everything else that is going on, we do have a shared interest in this,” he said in reference to the Salisbury poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and Boris Johnson’s comparison of Vladimir Putin to Hitler.At a briefing held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Westminster yesterday, Mr Roberts outlined the punishment awaiting hooligans falling foul of local Russian cops.At the minor end of the scale, touts face a £20,000 fine and deportation for every ticket they are caught selling while petty offences are punishable with 15 days imprisonment and a £291 fine.Individual hooligans causing trouble face five years hard labour in a detention centre, 480 hours of community service and a £5,825 fine.Anyone caught and convicted of mass disorder will be sentenced to between eight and 15 years hard labour and 10 years in a modern day gulag for assaulting anyone in authority, such as a cop or soldier.Up to 10,000 England fans are expected to travel to Russia, despite the paltry allocation of official tickets, through the FA.Just 1,460 tickets have been allocated to England for the Tunisia match, 1,772 for the second group game against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on June 24 and 2,359 for the final encounter four days later against Belgium in Kalinigrad, on the Polish border.Mr Roberts warned that any fans travelling without a ticket for the World Cup would be unlikely to be granted a visa to enter Russia.He also pointed out the logistical problems caused by the “huge distances” between cities and shortage of available accommodation.A total of 1,751 football banning orders have been issued by courts against yobs who must surrender their passports in advance of the tournament.Spotters from the UK Football Policing Unit are being deployed at UK ports to watch for hardcore thugs trying to sneak out of the country and will also be on the ground in Russia to engage with fans.Police chief Mr Roberts said the main concern were middle-of-the road fans who end up drinking too much and causing trouble rather than known hooligans.He said : “They are the people who there with a stag party excess...this gives me a degree of concern.”Warning of the particular concern about offence being caused in Volgograd and at its commemorative sites, he added : “Any student of history will know Russian casualties during World War Two were horrific.“If people from any other country got drunk and placed their flag on the Cenotaph it would make the locals here angry.”Kevin Miles, chief executive of the England Supporters’ Federation, has visited the cities where the Three Lions are playing, and said : “We have to treat the place with respect.“It is one thing to hang a flag up in a bar where the landlord has been taking your money.“But it is quite another to put in a place of particular sensitivity.“We want to be treated as welcome guests.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s been devastated by what’s happened.“After the revelation he had staged those paparazzi pictures, she has felt so let down and majorly questioned his loyalties.“He collaborated with the Press yet never condemned the actions of his other children Samantha and Junior, who were forever publicly disparaging Meghan.”While history has taught us is that the royals are adept at looking after themselves, this latest episode has left many wondering: just who is looking out for Thomas Markle?Clearly, the retired Hollywood lighting director has been left to fend for himself.Palace sources indicate that he was offered significant help and advice — but he turned it down.They also suggested that Meghan, 36, and Harry, 33, had tried to contact him before she finally got through yesterday.Thomas said he had not heard from his younger daughter after it made global news that he was not going to the wedding.But he said he had changed his mind after Meghan had called him.As for the advice — maybe it was never offered or perhaps he refused it as a proud man who believed he could handle the pressure.Either way, the Palace suits should have stayed in close contact because they must know the pressure is worse than he expected.Now he’s so anxious he’s been “popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter”.That is Samantha Markle — Meghan’s estranged half-sister who hasn’t seen her for ten years and is not invited.She has been shading Meghan as a “pushy princess” at every opportunity.And why no intervention from the Palace?Why has no one flown over to collect him, protect him behind castle gates and show some ­concern for a vulnerable man with heart problems?Where did it all go wrong and who to believe in this sorry saga?Thomas Markle Snr was a successful lighting director, but obviously bad with money.After his retirement he declared himself bankrupt in 2016 with credit card debts of £24,181 and savings of just £160.He moved to tiny Rosarito just across the US border with Mexico, hiding from the world in a ­ramshackle cliff-top house and not socialising with any of the expats.Thomas was so upset after he was pictured earlier this year looking dishevelled, he wanted to control the narrative.He colluded with a photo agency to get shots of him being measured for a suit, working out, reading a book on English history and looking at internet ­pictures of Harry and Meghan.Then came the bombshell revelation that he was so embarrassed to have been rumbled taking cash for the snaps, that he was pulling out of the wedding.Princess Diana’s best friend Rosa Monckton helped her pal dodge the paparazzi — but also knew how she used them for her own ends.Rosa told The Sun: “He strikes me as a man who is out of his depth at every level on this and I don’t judge him at all.“They should have advised him to hide up somewhere until after the wedding. He’s obviously very vulnerable and I don’t know what could have been done or should have been done to offer him more advice and protection.”So should that advice have come from Meghan — the actress with a grasp of the pitfalls of global fameTo answer that you need to understand their up-and-down relationship. Thomas was overjoyed at the birth of his baby girl with second wife Doria Ragland and appears to have been a positive role model for Suits star Meghan.Meghan has credited her dad — who won two Emmys — with being a huge influence on her career.Describing him as “hardworking” and “caring”, she has said that he “invested in my future so that I could grow up to have so much”.For a man from a poor family who grew up on simple dinners of “potatoes and spam”, this was helped by a £500,000 lottery win when Meghan was nine. Her half-brother Tom Jnr said: “That money allowed Meg to go to the best schools and get the best training”.Thomas Snr overcame the racial prejudice of others to marry an African-American and helped develop his daughter’s social conscience.He and Doria got hitched in 1979 but separated when Meghan was six.However, Thomas stayed in close contact with his daughter.Meghan recalled him buying a white Barbie family set and a black Barbie family — splitting them up to make “her” family. But as a teenager she didn’t want to see her father.Driving through her home city of Los Angeles aged 18 with then-best friend Ninaki Priddy, she said she would not visit her dad as they “weren’t on the best of terms”.But a post Meghan sent to her dad on Instagram on Father’s Day 2016 showed the extent of his influence on her and her love for him.She declared: “To this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films and club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank-you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose. I love you xo — Bean.” It was accompanied by a photo showing Meghan as an infant laying on her father’s chest.But a friend said of Thomas: “He’s always been a bit of a slob, selfish with no emotional intelligence.“They didn’t really connect when she was growing up as a girl and didn’t bond when she was a woman.“There were periods when they were closer — he helped her move to Toronto when she started Suits (in 2012). But as he’s become older he’s become much more reclusive.“The man he is today is not the man he was even ten, 15 years ago. He just eats junk food, sleeps in, drinks and reads.“She has helped him many times financially. But there just comes a point when you have to let go.“Not exactly wash her hands of him but there is only so much she can do.“Hence why she didn’t feel Harry had to meet him or that she needed her dad’s approval to get married.”Thomas is now saying he will make the wedding — as long as doctors allow him to fly. Let’s hope for Meghan’s sake he does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It also meant the company\u0027s by-then prodigious cash-flow - augmented by the sale of unwanted assets - could be invested in upgrading and expanding its networks, rather than having to be spent on servicing debt.Sir Chris\u0027s time is also associated with heavy investment in 3G licences around Europe.It was a thrilling time to be covering the company\u0027s fortunes and the soundtrack to it all was Bohemian Like You, a track by the US band The Dandy Warhols, which became ubiquitous as Vodafone became one of the world\u0027s heaviest-spending advertisers.When Sir Chris stepped down, in 2003, it fell to his Indian-born successor, Arun Sarin, to make all that investment pay off."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/cf9ff12470b6aa92e70fab8c0fcdd83e563fbfe93a8e65d401a05b9251786fd7_4311235.jpg?20180515210613 ","title":"israeli snipers and shifting rules of engagement","story":"Israelis say 16 militants were killed in two such attacks.But critics want an explanation of rules of engagement that remain secret but appear to have been relaxed.Britain and other allies of Israel are alarmed by the staggering casualty figures.The shift in rules seems to have allowed Israeli sharpshooters to kill and wound unarmed protesters.Nadav Weiman was in an Israeli military sniper unit 10 years ago.He now works for the NGO Breaking the Silence.He said: \"We see IDF snipers shooting at unarmed Palestinians when they are 300m away from the fence.\"That\u0027s a huge change from when I was a sniper and I think that this is a red line that I personally thought we were never going to cross.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-pm-may_4304642.jpg?20180509120848 ","title":"may promises to spell out brexit strategy in government dossier","story":"Downing Street claims the document will \"include detailed, ambitious and precise explanations of our positions...it should set out what will change and what will feel different outside the EU\".The white paper was announced just hours after rock legend Sir Mick Jagger added his voice to calls for the Prime Minister to spell out her Brexit strategy and end the customs confusion.\"Everyone would like to see a fast resolution, a united front and some leadership that\u0027s united rather than split,\" the Rolling Stones frontman said in a radio interview.The Government\u0027s aim is to publish the white paper in time for the next EU summit of European leaders in six weeks\u0027 time.

Speaking ahead of the debate Keir Starmer, Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit secretary, said: \"The Government\u0027s Brexit strategy is in complete and utter deadlock.\"Nearly two years on from the referendum, ministers have still yet to agree what our future customs and trading relationship with Europe will look like after Brexit.\"Instead, the Prime Minister has wasted months pursing her two fatally flawed customs options and presiding over a Government that is too busy arguing with itself to negotiate for Britain."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/03/2048x1152/skynews-donald-trump-kim-jong-un_4250776.jpg?20180309070340 ","title":"n korea no interest in summit based on one sided demands","story":"Kim Kye Gwan appeared to be responding to recent comments from Mr Trump\u0027s security adviser John Bolton and others suggesting that North Korea should follow the \"Libyan model\" of nuclear disarmament.If the US-North Korea summit was to be cancelled, it would be frustrating and embarrassing for Mr Trump, who had promised to make it a \"very special moment for world peace\".It will also be a blow to optimism inspired by last month\u0027s historic meeting between Mr Kim and South Korea\u0027s leader President Moon Jae-in.At that meeting, the first between the two countries in 11 years, Mr Kim pledged a \"new history\".A joint statement said the two had confirmed their goal of achieving \"a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through complete denuclearisation\".The statement did not provide any new specific ideas on how to achieve the objective, however."},{"url":null,"title":"bungling home office sends paperwork","story":"NewsBungling Home Office sends paperwork for an asylum seeker\u0027s social worker to a student with the same name living nearbyStaff sent 35-year-old Laura Pendleton a bundle of letters meant for the immigrant\u0027s responsible adult.\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByEleanor SharplesNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent13:55, 15 MAY 2018Updated15:45, 15 MAY 2018News (Image: Triangle News)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Home Office has launched an investigation after it wrongly sent sensitive paperwork intended for an asylum seeker\u0027s social worker to a student with the same name living nearby. In the latest bungle staff at the scandal-hit department sent 35-year-old Laura Pendleton a bundle of letters meant for the immigrant\u0027s responsible adult.

Mr Grayling has the option of re-nationalising the network - a move demanded by Labour and rail unions, but would be a humiliating for the Tory cabinet minister. Or he could hand the operator, which is 90% owned by Stagecoach and 10% by Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, a new non-profitmaking contract to run the service for a further two years.

The Prime Minister did not single out either side alone for blame despite Turkey\u0027s President accusing Israel of waging terrorism and saying: Israel will not be forgiven. Mrs May stood alongside President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the pair met for talks in Downing Street.  Erdogan - himself branded a fascist by protesters today over his human rights record - blasted Israel and its backers the US.  He said: You are powerful but you are not right. History will not forgive you and this is the fact we will observe in the future. Israel will not be forgiven.  So it all boils down to making a choice. Are we going to side with the strong, or side with those who are right?  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also accused Israel of flagrant illegality and demanded tougher UK action.  But Mrs May said: The loss of life we have seen is tragic and extremely concerning. Such violence is destructive to peace efforts and we call on all sides to show restraint. There is an urgent need to establish the facts of what happened yesterday through an independent and transparent investigation, including why such a volume of live fire was used - and what role Hamas played in events.  On Palestinians, she said: Palestinians have the right to protest but these protests must be peaceful. We are concerned that extremist elements are seeking to hijack legitimate protests to further their own objectives. On Israel, she added: The use of live fire and resulting loss of life is deeply troubling. We urge Israel to show restraint.” Palestinian officials say 60 Palestinians died yesterday after Israeli troops opened fire during protests on the Gaza border. The figure rose from 59 overnight after an eight-month-old baby died from tear gas. The girl\u0027s family said she inhaled the gas at a protest camp near the border. More than 2,200 Palestinians were also injured by gunfire or tear gas, local medics said. Yesterday was the bloodiest day for Palestinians since the 2014 Gaza war.  Another Palestinian was killed today but numbers at the border were generally lower as protesters buried their dead. Palestinian medical officials say 106 Gazans have now been killed since the start of the protests and nearly 11,000 people wounded, about 3,500 of them hit by live fire. Israeli officials dispute those numbers and say they are acting in self-defence. The Israeli military said at least 24 of those killed on Monday were terrorists with documented terror background and most of them were active operatives of Hamas.

Sajid Javid revealed the shock figure in a grilling by the Commons Home Affairs Committee. It comes just weeks after Mr Javid, whose predecessor Amber Rudd resigned over the scandal, said he was not aware of any Windrush citizens being wrongly deported. Furious Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: The responsibility for these wrongful deportations stops at Theresa May\u0027s door. Apologies are not enough for the lives that have been ruined and the deep hurt and pain that communities have suffered. Campaigning MP David Lammy added: This is the worst human rights and home affairs crisis in my time in politics. The Prime Minister\u0027s hostile environment stands in the dock, guilty as charged. The 63 people are Caribbean nationals who were removed from the UK since records began in 2002, and who are also over the age of 45.  Their age means some of them might have arrived in Britain before 1973 - a legal cut-off date. Under UK law, anyone who arrived from the Caribbean before 1973 should have had an automatic right to stay in Britain, so should not be deported. Home Office officials do not yet know how many of the 63 should have been protected under Windrush law.  Only last week the Immigration Minister, Caroline Nokes, said she had not yet found a single wrongful deportation of a Windrush citizen. Her officials also suggested only a handful of people - five - had been wrongly deported from Britain at all in the last five years, even beyond the Windrush scandal. Yet today Mr Javid suggested the final total could be even higher than 63, telling MPs: It\u0027s not a final number at this point - it could change. The work on those records is still ongoing.  Of the 63 citizens, Mr Javid said 32 were removed because they committed crimes. The other 31 were administrative removals, which includes people who were sent Home Office letters telling them to leave. The cases were found in an ongoing trawl of 8,000 Home Office records on people deported from the UK since 2002. Mr Javid confirmed: Out of the 8,000, there\u0027s so far a focus on 63 where there\u0027s something on their record that indicates they could have been in the UK before 1973.  The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

But one call-out would change his life. He was sent to help a young girl struggling to breathe, and on arrival he saw she was the victim of appalling abuse. Despite all his efforts to save her she died in hospital. It was not the first time a patient had not made it, but something about this 2014 case triggered a hidden pain, and the dad-of-four became haunted by the child’s image. Soon he was suffering nightmares, cold sweats and vivid flashbacks. “I was in a dark place,” says Dan, 32, of the North West Ambulance Service. “I felt a sense of impending doom, like I was in a plane that was about to crash.” Finally he talked to fellow paramedic Rich Morton, 29, and with his support sought medical help. He was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Now Dan and Rich have set up Our Blue Light, an initiative to help essential services staff who might be struggling. “We all know how to deal with cuts and CPR but what about mental health first aid?” says Dan, of Blackpool. “Once you put the uniform on, people forget that you’re human. We want to change that.”  The pair received the Mental Health Champion honour from film star Michael Sheen at our first NHS Heroes Awards, brought to you by ITV and the Mirror, which were held this week at London’s Park Lane Hilton and will be broadcast next Monday. Prince William, a supporter of the duo’s work, sent a video message in which he called them “inspiring”. He added: “They are doing incredible work to tackle PTSD and other mental health issues through Our Blue Light. “I want to say a huge congratulations to Dan and Rich, both for your contribution to mental health and on winning this award. You are true NHS Heroes.” And while the award was indeed an honour, especially during Mental Health Awareness Week, Dan’s biggest wish is just to help as many people like him as possible. He joined the NWAS at 18 and in two years’ training learned practical skills such as medical care and driving an ambulance. But there was no advice on dealing mentally with traumatic situations. “Nothing equips us for it,” says Dan. “The culture was we don’t talk of our mental health. We help people – why would we need help ourselves? I recall going out to my first deceased person. The crew told me, ‘You’ll see this a lot lad’. Nothing more was said about it.” Dan says it is not just major horrors such as last year’s Grenfell Tower fire and terror attacks in London and Manchester that can mental stress for emergency staff.  “It’s a kind of drip, drip effect,” he says. “That day in 2014 it was evident the child was taking her final breaths. We did all we could but she later died. I knew right away it would be very difficult to deal with. “I struggled to sleep and grew isolated. I had nightmares, vivid flashbacks and woke up in a cold sweats. It was very scary.” His feelings were intensified because his children reminded him of the victim. “She had blonde hair, like them, and if you take something like this home you relate it to the family,” he says. “Just going to the park with the kids was a worry but I didn’t know what I was scared of. “Part of me was ashamed. I was scared someone would say, ‘If you can’t deal with this sort of stuff, then the job isn’t for you’.” After two weeks he texted colleague Rich, who says: “I thought the best thing to do was go and listen.” Dan said: “It was like the weight of the world came off my shoulders.” On Rich’s advice he saw his GP and was diagnosed with PTSD. He had counselling and therapy and was off work for five months. “Eventually the nightmares and flashbacks stopped,” he says.

Thomas Markle Snr, 73, remains in North America - with Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s nuptials in the UK just four days away.  He had been expected to walk her down the aisle on Saturday, but last night it was claimed he no longer plans to give her away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi amid reports he had suffered a heart attack last week.  It\u0027s now emerged that the royal family were allegedly caught flatfooted when the news that he would not be attending broke last night, TMZ reports.  It added that up until that point the Palace had been planning a security detail, accommodation and access to events for the father of the bride. Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims that it was blindsided by the news when approached by MirrorOnline. The news has cast light on not just Thomas Snr but the wider Markle family - who were completely unknown until they were cast into the limelight when Meghan got engaged to Prince Harry.   Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland could walk the American actress down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle if Mr Markle doesn\u0027t attend the ceremony.   He claims he hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan, 36, since reports emerged that he had decided not to attend the wedding.   Mr Markle told TMZ he\u0027s been popping Valium to ease his chest pains after suffering a heart attack, and he could return to hospital as early as Monday night.   Mr Markle told the website he suffered a heart attack six days ago and his new chest pains have been triggered by emotional upset. Reports suggest some plans for the wedding have been thrown into turmoil with Mr Markle deciding to stay put at home. Mr Markle allegedly sold the paparazzi snaps - showing him going to shops and fast food restaurants - for \u0026pound100,000, and admitted to TMZ that he was paid for the images.     It was claimed Harry is blaming himself after Mr Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, reportedly pulled out of the wedding.  Meghan was said to be distraught and standing by her father, and has reportedly begged him to change his mind and walk her down the aisle as planned in front of 600 guests and a TV audience of millions. Harry and Meghan released a statement Monday night to address reports that Mr Markle wouldn\u0027t attend the ceremony.  A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation. In an interview with TMZ, Mr Markle called out his oldest daughter, Meghan\u0027s estranged half-sister Samantha Markle, who has criticised the Suits actress and claimed she was to blame for the paparazzi controversy. He added: I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.  The pensioner, who lives in the Pacific coastal city of Rosarito, Mexico, fears he will suffer a third heart attack, it was claimed.  Piers Morgan lashed out at Samantha Markle for being a media vulture in a furious tirade on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday.  He was left fuming when Meghan\u0027s sister tried to blame the media for her father\u0027s troubles. Samantha, who suffers from MS, has claimed she wasn\u0027t invited to divorcee Meghan\u0027s first wedding - on a beach in Jamaica - because of her wheelchair.  The 53-year-old revealed she hasn\u0027t spoken to her sister since 2015.  She has also previously blasted the royal wedding guest list by claiming that she had shunned her own family in favour of thousands of complete strangers.  Meghan\u0027s estranged half-brother Thomas Markle Jnr, 50, wrote an open letter begging to be invited to the wedding, despite telling Harry to call it off.

Thomas Markle Snr says he is due to undergo an operation this morning, just three days before Meghan ties the knot with Prince Harry. He told TMZ details of the surgery, saying: They [doctors] will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed. It comes after Mr Markle Snr reportedly revealed that he wanted to walk Meghan, 36, down the aisle at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, on Saturday.  The 73-year-old was said to have had a \u0027change of mind\u0027 - less than 24 hours after pulling out of performing the honour at St George\u0027s Chapel. He earlier told the gossip site: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle. But he feared his heart problems could prevent him from doing this.  It is thought Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland has stepped in to walk her down the aisle in her father\u0027s absence. Earlier on Tuesday, the 61-year-old was picked up from her LA home and chauffeur driven to LAX airport, according to TMZ. The website reports that she was given the A-list treatment, dropped off at the new Private Suite before being driven directly to her flight. The father was said to be back in hospital, undergoing a series of tests, after suffering from serious chest pains following a heart attack last week.  Speaking to Australian news programme Sunrise, Samantha Markle, Meghan\u0027s half sister, said: Everything about him being under an incredible amount of stress is true and he, you know, sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery so all of that was true. He\u0027s been under a tremendous amount of stress amidst challenges and I hope, I think we\u0027re all hoping he pulls through this now and can still go the wedding.  The surgery is said to be taking place at 7.30am local time. Mr Markle Snr will likely be recovering from the procedure when his former actress daughter, 36, and Harry, 33, tie the knot in Windsor this weekend. In a statement earlier this month, Kensington Palace said the father, who lives near Rosarito, Mexico, would walk Meghan down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. A spokesman said at the time: “Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to welcoming Ms Markle\u0027s parents to Windsor for the wedding. Mr Thomas Markle and Ms Doria Ragland will be arriving in the UK in the week of the wedding, allowing time for Prince Harry\u0027s family, including The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to spend time with them before the big day.  Both of the bride\u0027s parents will have important roles in the wedding. On the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle. Mr Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. Ms. Markle is delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion.” But last night, it was claimed that Mr Markle Snr no longer planned to travel to Britain to give Meghan away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi. The father earlier told TMZ that he had meant no harm to his daughter or the Royal Family when he set up a photoshoot in an Internet cafe. The shoot is said to have been part of a deal worth \u0026pound100,000.  Reports suggested some wedding plans had been thrown into turmoil with the ex-Hollywood lighting director deciding to stay put at home. It was claimed Harry was blaming himself for the situation, while Meghan was said to be distraught and standing by her father. Last night, the couple released a statement addressing the reports that Mr Markle Snr was not going to attend the ceremony. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.

Meghan\u0027s dad is reportedly being prepped for major heart surgery and it is incredibly unlikely he will make it to Windsor Castle to walk the former Suits star down the aisle to wed Prince Harry. On Sunday it was reported Thomas Markle had set up paparazzi photos of himself preparing for the much-anticipated wedding in exchange for cash. Less than 24 hours later he told magazine website TMZ he was pulling out of the wedding due to a heart attack suffered last week.  But following messages from Meghan he is believed to have changed his mind again - before it emerged that he had to undergo major heart surgery and will not attend. But his daughter Samantha, Meghan\u0027s half-sister, has defended Thomas. Speaking to Australian morning news programme Sunrise she was asked if the reports in TMZ were true. She said: Don\u0027t believe tabloids but we\u0027re really not sure at this point... Everything about him being under an incredible amount of stress is true and he, you know, sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery so all of that was true. He\u0027s been under a tremendous amount of stress amidst challenges and I hope, I think we\u0027re all hoping he pulls through this now and can still go the wedding. He sent me a message that he was prepping for surgery an hour ago, it\u0027s a little more imminent than tomorrow.  When told this would make it almost impossible for him to attend she replied: I can\u0027t speak for him. It depends on the extent and the complication of the surgery. I don\u0027t know what that entails yet, so I\u0027m leaving that up top his doctors but my concern really is more that he pulls through safely and whatever happens after that we\u0027ll just wait and see. Samantha was then asked if the situation around her dad has \u0027spun out of control\u0027. She said: Is it out of control that a normal American family have to come out and defend themselves against media created drama, really? I mean the negative slamming all of the tabloid headlines - those were tabloid created from the very beginning last year.

Rubina Khan told her brother she was going to the dentist with 10-year-old Amaar - who was wearing his school uniform - just moments before the pair were hit and killed by a train in September 2014. The mother bought an adult and child train ticket to Windsor at a packed Slough train station full of morning commuters but walked to an empty platform where no trains were due to stop. Train driver David Campbell-Kinder said he saw the 46-year-old bending down to talk to 10-year-old Amaar before climbing onto the tracks with him in her arms and laying down as horrified commuters watched. Just seconds later, the pair were hit and killed by the 8.41am Bedwyn to London Paddington service at about 9.45am. Amaar\u0027s backpack full of school books was found by officers on a bench on the platform, their inquest heard today.  In a statement read to the Berkshire Coroner Peter Bedford at Reading coroner\u0027s court, her brother Zahire Khan said he was surprised to see the pair on September 23 when he stopped and spoke to them just 30 minutes before they died. I was surprised to see her as I had never seen her in town before and it was a school day and Amaar was with her, he said. They were surprised to see me as well, but a nice unexpected surprise and we stopped and had a brief chat. Amaar appeared to be happy and excited and I asked \u0027what are you lot doing here?\u0027 Rubina smiled and said she had an appointment with her dentist in London and Amaar had the day off.

Revellers for the Royal wedding are set for a sizzling treat with forecasters confident the blue skies and sunshine will hold out until Saturday - and probably beyond.  There is a chance the mercury could even beat the record currently set for May 19 (28.3C), which was recorded in the Argyll Forest Park in Scotland in 1948. Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden told The Express spring could end with another potentially record-breaking bank holiday scorcher.  He said: “The remainder of this month will remain predominantly summery and confidence is increasing for another burst of very warm to hot temperatures for the next bank holiday weekend. “It is plausible that maximum temperatures could rise into the high 20Cs or even the low 30Cs for several days in a row within this period. This will pave the way for a warm and settled start to summer.” The weather will see a brief dip on Wednesday before turning warmer again. Spokesman Grahame Madge said: “High pressure is back in charge and so the outlook is for the weather to be largely fine through this week. “Confidence for good weather on Saturday is increasing, we expect temperatures of between 20C (68F) and 23C (73.4F).  “Temperatures will build through the start of this week with Tuesday likely to be the warmest day, we could possibly see 25C (77F) in parts. “A cold front will bring these values down by around six to nine degrees on Wednesday before it turns warmer again. “There may be some fronts approaching the northwest bringing unsettled conditions over the weekend, but for the majority of the UK we expect conditions to remain dry and fine. “There are no strong signals yet for this pattern of weather coming to an end.”  MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said on Monday: “Air will probably start coming to the UK from France, with 24C shown on forecast models by May 21 as temperatures increase. “The weather for the royal wedding looks good for people enjoying time outdoors.” American Ms Markle will be relieved after her reported worries about Britain’s weather disrupting her wedding. The couple will travel in an open-topped carriage if dry, but a covered carriage if wet. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “It looks like sunblock not brollies for Harry and Meghan’s big day.

The teenager had hidden two pages of her original childhood diary with brown sticky paper prior to its publication, leaving a mystery as to the contents underneath. Using digital scanning techniques, researchers have now discovered that the pages contain four rude jokes and her thoughts about sex education. The entries candidly discuss periods, the mechanics of sex and her own understanding of prostitution which she once heard through her father, Otto.   “They bring us even closer to the girl and the writer Anne Frank,” said Ronald Leopold, the executive director of the Anne Frank House museum.  According to Leopold, Frank’s writings are unsurprising as the teenager candidly discussed her sexual development elsewhere throughout the diary.  It is unclear why Anne felt compelled hide her writings but Leopold believes that she was worried that others would discover her diary and read it. Anne wrote the pages in September 1943, less than three months after she and her family were forced into hiding from Nazi troops at a secret annex behind a canalside Amsterdam home.  On prostitution, she wrote: “All men, if they are normal, go with women, women like that accost them on the street and then they go together. In Paris they have big houses for that. Papa has been there.” While on the subject of periods, she said they are “a sign that she is ripe to have relations with a man but one doesn’t do that of course before one is married”.  “Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile,” said Frank van Vree, the director of the Netherlands Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies.  “The dirty jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad dug with bare hands","story":"NewsDad dug \u0027with bare hands\u0027 to rescue tragic seven-year-old son from plane crash - which he avoided after parachuting out moments earlierKris Kacprzak and 15 other parachutists had made a scheduled jump from the small plane just minutes before it went down\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByEdel HughesNiall O\u0027ConnorMichael McHugh12:20, 15 MAY 2018Updated12:53, 15 MAY 2018NewsKacper Kacprzak, aged seven, stayed on board the plane with the pilot (Image: Irish Mirror)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA distraught father who watched his seven-year-old son die in a plane crash dug with his bare hands in a desperate bid to rescue the tragic youngster. Kris Kacprzak and 15 other parachutists had made a scheduled jump from the small plane just minutes before it went down. His son Kacper stayed on board with pilot Neil \u0027Billy\u0027 Bowditch and both were killed in the tragedy in Co Offaly, Ireland. Mr Kacprzak, from Dublin, ran more than half a mile to the boggy site after witnessing the crash and desperately tried to dig out his son, the Irish Mirror reports.  A source close to the Irish Parachute Club told the Irish Daily Mail that the tragedy was unfolding by the time Mr Kacprzak had safely landed on the ground after jumping from the light aircraft. The plane went down on bog land in the Irish midlands on Sunday afternoon. The source said: Kris made the jump from the plane and by the time he landed, this terrible tragedy was unfolding. Kris dug with his bare hands during the recovery operation as we battled to save them.  Kris is something of a skydive enthusiast and Kacper loved his father. He loved planes and I have no doubt as he grew up would have loved to be up there with his dad. The source added: The pilot was a very well respected and experienced pilot from the UK. We have no idea what could have happened but it is very much tragedy for both families and for us as a wider community. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page has been set up by Allaiouti Hassan, a friend of the Kacprzaks, to help both grieving families.

Footage of their bizarre find was posted to YouTube channel Explore With Us, and initially showed them walking around the rural camp. The derelict site in an unknown location shows vehicles left to rot and buildings crumbling to the ground. As the explorers continue their walk through the eerie site, they enter a tiny one-room building, before making their disturbing discovery. A metal shelving unit covering the back wall is pulled away, revealing a huge hole ripped in the wall behind - leading to the hidden room. The man filming the bizarre scene instructs another member of the team to investigate the contents of two tubs placed on shelving inside the room.  They then discover the tubs are filled with bullets before going on to film images of \u0027weird\u0027 cartoons and hardcore pornography stuck to the walls. The team then find ropes and bottles of alcohol littering the floor. While it\u0027s not known where the site is located, many viewers online said it seemed a great distance from any other signs of civilisation. Lance Shank said: That place is crazy. Whoever lived out there must\u0027ve been one hell of a person and probably not very welcoming to live out there with a watch out tower and surveillance cameras.  Other online viewers urged the explorers to call the police and report what they found. Paisley Campbell said: You should tell the police. Tell them you were hiking around and found this place..make an anonymous call So many lost and missing women and children in this country. Others had more rational explanations for the creepy site, suggesting it could have been a base for miners.

The Polish painter was born in Warsaw, 120 years ago in 1898, Her love for art started at an early age - as a young child, she spent a summer in Italy with her grandmother, who inspired her love for great Italian Renaissance painters. When her parents divorced, she was sent to live with her wealthy aunt in Russia. It was during this time that Lempicka was exposed to the lives of nobility as well as her future husband, Tadeusz Lempicki.  Shortly after their marriage, the Russian Revolution began and Lempicka, now a refugee, moved from St. Petersburg to Paris. It was there, at the height of post-cubism, where she began her formal artistic training under the influence of French painters Maurice Denis and Andr\u0026eacute Lhote.  Taking in her grandiose and decorative surroundings, Lempicka went on to produce exquisite tributes to the Roaring Twenties in her own unique way, utilising a blend of late neoclassical and refined cubist styles in her art. Her affinity for the luxurious also led her to fixate on portraits of artists, stars, and aristocrats, which coupled with her considerable charm and exotic lifestyle, lit up the art world and social circles of the period.   Today’s Doodle was created by artist Matthew Cruickshank, who paid homage to Lempicka’s unique style.  He said: “Few artists embodied the exuberant roaring twenties more than polish artist Tamara de Lempicka.  Her fast paced, opulent lifestyle manifests itself perfectly into the stylized Art-Deco subjects she celebrated in her paintings. I first encountered Lempicka\u0027s work at her Royal Academy show in London, 2004. I was struck by the scale and skill of her paintings coupled with her life (as colorful as her work!).

It heated water from room temperature to 100,000 degrees Centigrade - in under a trillionth of a second. The Swedish team used a super strong laser machine to turn Earth\u0027s most important liquid into an exotic state - from which they hope to learn more about it. In less than a tenth of a picosecond - that is 75 millionths of a billionth of a second or 0.000 000 000 000 075 seconds - the water changes from liquid to plasma. The device called the Linac Coherent Light Source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory near Palo Alto, California, shot intense and ultra short X-ray pulses at a jet of water.  The machine is a billion times brighter than the previous generation of lasers. Each X-ray pulse has as much power as the national grid of a large country, and a hundred are produced every second. Dr Carl Caleman said:  It is not the usual way to boil your water. Normally, when you heat water, the molecules will just be shaken stronger and stronger. At the chemical level heat is motion - meaning the hotter the molecules the more rapidly they move, according to Dr Caleman. This can be achieved via heat transfer from a stove, or more directly with microwaves that make the water molecules swing back and forth ever faster in step with the electromagnetic field. Dr Caleman, of Uppsala University in Sweden, said: Our heating is fundamentally different. The energetic X-rays punch electrons out of the water molecules, thereby destroying the balance of electric charges. So, suddenly, the atoms feel a strong repulsive force and start to move violently. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said a plasma is a state of matter where the electrons have been removed from the atoms, leading to a sort of electrically charged gas.

retire","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe council boss who has overseen much of Dundee’s Waterfront regeneration is set to retire in the coming months.Mike Galloway, Dundee City Council’s executive director of city development, has told the authority of his intention to retire.It is thought he will depart before the end of the financial year next March, having guided the Waterfront project towards the completion of two major milestones: a new rail station entrance, and the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway has led the regeneration efforts in Dundee since 1997 when the project first began.Since then, he has developed the area’s masterplan and pushed for new investment coming into the city.As such, he leaves a diverse legacy in his wake after 21 years: the demolition of Tayside House, the relocation of the Olympia, realigned Tay Road Bridge ramps, the Waterfront plots and, of course, the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway was born in Aberfeldy and raised in Glasgow, but later attended Perth Academy before earning a degree at Dundee University.He left the city after graduating, working for almost two decades as a city planner before returning to Dundee to work on the Waterfront project.Mr Galloway has declined the Tele’s request for an interview at this time.However, a number of his council colleagues paid tribute to the sizeable portfolio of work he leaves in his wake.Councillor Will Dawson, planning committee convener, said: “It has been a pleasure working with Mike during my time as city development convener and even now as planning convener.‘‘It is really clear to see that his first priority during his time as director has been the city.‘‘It is fair to say that he has left a firm foundation for whoever will become his successor.‘‘They, too, will have to be bold and ambitious for our city.’’City development convener Lynne Short added: ‘‘Mike Galloway has been instrumental in the changes that we see around the city, but will I am sure be most remembered for the regeneration of the Waterfront.‘‘It is very fitting that his retirement will coincide with one of the most talked about buildings of this generation opening in the form of the V\u0026ampA Dundee.’’Council leader John Alexander said: “Mike will leave a very positive legacy, one which has helped the city to realise international recognition and grow its reputation significantly.‘‘The city owes Mike a great gratitude.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee mps supports pdsa scheme to support low income pet owners","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee MPs Chris Law and

squad for next term, the striker has been identified as a man who can grab the goals to get them back to the Premiership.The 26-year-old scored 25 times in a two-year spell with the Tangerines before moving to Hibs when his contract expired last summer.Despite scoring 14 times during his first six months at Easter Road, he was loaned out to Dundee for the second half of the campaign.He hit the net three times for the Dark Blues, helping them get vital points as they survived in the top flight.Murray has now returned to the Hibees and has a year left on his contract but the feeling is he will be

The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road.
