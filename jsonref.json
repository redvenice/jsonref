Indeed, my claim to be the Fifth Johnson was enhanced by the fact that my hair was blond and even messier than Boris’s. In fact, part of me wonders if I inspired his trademark unkempt look.Looking back at that garden photo with the benefit of hindsight, it can be seen as a symbol of what Classics-quoting Boris might call his modus operandi.During one university summer vacation, I recall Boris’s father, Stanley, arranging for Boris and Rachel to investigate ‘animal atrocities’ in Spain and Portugal for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Allegra and I were WAGS who went along for the ride.After a week attending bull fights and monitoring the cruel tradition of photographing captive animals on beaches, Allegra left us to return home and we continued on our way.         Partying again in 2008: Boris and Sebastian at a bash held for the 180th anniversary of The SpectatorEach night for a week, Boris would sit me down, man-to-man and ask me over tapas whether he should marry Allegra. He was clearly in a state of mental anguish.By telling him they were far too young and that he should hold his horses, I felt like a Cassandra figure prophesying doom.Most of his other male friends also cautioned him against a precipitate marriage.Imagine my mortification when I later discovered that Boris had already secretly proposed to Allegra before our trip abroad.He had not been confronting the agony of indecision, as I thought at the time, but the agony of having already embarked on a course of action from which he felt there was no way back.There is a clear pattern of behaviour here: suffering mental anguish over difficult decisions and devising uniquely Boris strategies to wriggle through.For example, the way he weighed up both sides of the question of marriage was similar to what he did three decades later when he prepared two drafts of his weekly Daily Telegraph column — one in favour of Brexit, the other for Remain — before deciding which one he would use.Ever the intellectual, he explained that such bizarre behaviour (which critics said proved he had no principles) helped make his mind up.Another case in point was his attempt to become president of the Oxford Union debating society. Although not as Left-wing as the student body at his college, Balliol, it was inconceivable for a Tory such as Boris to be elected president.Balliol’s then Master, Anthony Kenny, later remembered: ‘Boris concealed his Conservative affiliation and let it be widely understood that he was a Social Democrat. So far as I know, he told no actual lies, but his strategy recalled Thomas Macaulay’s words about the difference between lying and deceiving: “Metternich told lies all the time, and never deceived any one Talleyrand never told a lie and deceived the whole world.”’         I became the Fifth Johnson — in a similar way that the ‘Fifth Beatle’ is an informal title applied to any number of musicians who were at one point a member of The Beatles He said, in reference to the Austrian and French diplomats during the Napoleonic era that with ‘Talleyrand-like skill’, Boris was duly elected president of the Oxford Union.Kenny went on to say that he was subsequently contacted by an MP for the then Social Democratic Party who was looking for an intern to work for him.‘I’ve just the man for you,’ Kenny told him. ‘Bright and witty and with suitable political views. He’s just finished being president of the Union, and his name is Boris Johnson.’When Kenny summoned Boris to ask whether he was interested in the job, Boris burst out laughing: ‘Master, don’t you know I am a dyed-in-the-wool Tory?’Pure Boris!Whenever I see him at London parties these days, we reminisce in mock reverie about our Oxford University days together before he always mutters under his breath the words: ‘Omerta, omerta.’This is a reference to the code of silence practised by the mafia (and a refusal to give evidence to police about illegal activities). Boris says it half in jest, but also half in earnest.         Boris Johnson holds up a bagged smoked fish during his speech during a Conservative leadership hustingsHe expects loyalty from his closest friends (of whom there are very few) and the unspoken understanding is that their loyalty will be reciprocated.In the infamous secret tape-recording of a conversation between Boris and his Old Etonian friend turned jewel thief Darius Guppy in 1990, Guppy pledges his ‘love’ to Johnson after he agreed to help him track down and beat up a tabloid journalist who was on Guppy’s trail.(Incidentally, I once recall him thumping his sister during a heated discussion about who was the lead singer of The Clash. Rachel had insisted it was Paul Simonon. Boris rightly named Joe Strummer.)Boris later dismissed the conversation with Guppy as a joke.But for him, friendship is no laughing matter.When I went to study at Oxford University in 1984, Boris had been there a year and had already made his mark.He was fully formed, unlike so many other juvenile undergraduates, and was talked of as a future statesman. He was super-clever (with Balliol having given him a scholarship funded by a bequest dating back to the 19th century from the philanthropist Hannah Brackenbury), could recite Shakespeare sonnets on the hoof as he strode down Oxford’s streets and had bagged Allegra, the most beautiful girl in his year. At the time, she was a Conde Nast magazine cover girl.At the Oxford Union, he was justly renowned for his oratory and seemingly off-the-cuff jokes. Of course, we all suspected they were well-rehearsed but they were no less funny.He sprinkled his speeches with Latin and Greek references — many of which went way over our heads. Of course, he was a member of the Bullingdon Club, the notorious and elitist dining society which generally invited only Old Etonians to join.He was present during one of its meetings in Oxford when a pot plant was thrown through a restaurant window and some members ended up in police cells.Many years later, Boris, who was among those arrested, recalled: ‘The party ended up with a number of us crawling on all fours through the hedges of the botanical gardens, and trying to escape police dogs. And once we were in the cells, we became pathetic namby-pambies.’In fact, the Boris I knew was not the Bullingdon Boris nor the Oxford Union Boris — it was not Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson at all.He was known by his family and friends simply as ‘Al’, an abbreviation of his first name. Boris nicknamed me Bossman Von Sebsies (don’t ask me why).We holidayed together. We romanced together (with our respective girlfriends). We played what he calls whiff-whaff (the game invented on the dining tables of Victorian England and which most of us know as table-tennis) and enjoyed our gilded youth.Al was warm, affable, tremendous company, sensitive and artistic.This was a talent inherited from his brilliant artist mother, Charlotte Johnson Wahl, who always insisted her eldest son was a softie who could be more easily hurt than Rachel. That was her version of Al, which didn’t quite square with the public Boris.Sometimes the two sides of his character seemed to be in tension.Boris loved playing to the gallery, was ever restless, competitive and had a hunger to succeed.         Boris Johnson speaks at a Conservative Party leadership campaign hustings at the Excel Centre in LondonRachel recalls he once broke one of his toes by kicking the table in a temper over losing a table tennis point to her. He once played me at squash and obliterated me over five games. The score? 9-0. 9-0. 9-0. 9-0. 9-0. I privately thought: ‘Come on, you bastard, surely you can give me one point! Instead, I meekly said: “Well done, Al.”’To understand the Boris phenomenon, you have to look at his parents’ disastrous marriage.Critics say Boris Johnson loves only himself, whereas the truth is that he is always seeking love and approval.The Johnson sibling rivalry is well known. For example, Rachel once said to Boris: ‘Have you heard the bad news about Jo? He got a First.’And when Boris was at university, he felt he was in competition with his own father.Stanley had been another early achiever who met his future wife when both were Oxford undergraduates. (Charlotte gave birth to Boris when she was 22 before she had graduated and Stanley won the Newdigate poetry prize.)Boris’s father later orced Charlotte, and her prolonged absences in hospital with depression meant all the children were frequently left to their own devices.Self-sufficiency became an imperative.Boris, it seemed, was determined to match, if not eclipse, Stanley’s matrimonial, procreative and academic achievements.Stanley certainly put me through my paces.When once visiting his family farm, Nethercote in Exmoor, he proposed a walk one morning and suggested we exchange Wellington boots.I thought this was some quaint West Country ritual I was unfamiliar with, or maybe a throwback Turkish custom in honour of his Eastern roots.I happily obliged.Only half an hour into our walk did the purpose of his gesture become apparent.Both my feet were waterlogged. One of Stanley’s boots had holes in it. He cackled with laughter and found it all tremendously funny. Another episode became famous in the Johnson family annals and was referred to ever after as ‘the Rape of the Jacket’.Boris, Jo, Leo, Allegra and myself were seated at table for lunch. I was in the habit of wearing a jacket, even in hot weather.Calmly, Stanley repeatedly asked me to take it off, saying: ‘It’s fairly warm in here.’But then he erupted: ‘Right, that’s it. I can’t take it any more.’Before I knew it, he had got up from his seat, marched around the table to my chair, stood behind me and yanked the jacket off me.The whole family sniggered with laughter. Heartless or too hearty? I could never decide.For all the talk of Boris’s Turkish ancestry, he was born in New York, educated at Eton College and was brought up in the heartland of the privileged, metropolitan elite.His godmother was Lady Rachel Billington, novelist daughter of the prison reform campaigner Earl of Longford. And dinner chez Charlotte in Elgin Crescent, Notting Hill, was always a stimulating affair that resembled the talking shop of the British Establishment.One night we would be joined by Anthony Howard, the then deputy editor of The Observer. Another night it would be Simon Jenkins, the future Times editor.Boris always held his own in such company. But then again his maternal grandfather was a Fellow of All Souls in Oxford and reputedly one of the cleverest men in England. That key human value for Boris — loyalty — emerged once more.For example, when Anthony Howard cast aspersions on our university contemporary Toby Young, Boris loyally rose to his defence.Other principles were firmly held.I remember one conversation he had with his maternal grandmother on the Isle of Skye. She asked Boris if he believed in free will. (Such weighty issues were what passed for small talk in the Johnson household.)‘I think I believe in the sensation of free will,’ said Boris. In other words, he believed in fate.The truth is that Boris has always had a sense of his own destiny and this matched his childhood vow to become world leader.Other values are also non-negotiable.Much has been written about Boris’s chaotic organisational skills.His stag night was a classic example. One Sunday, a week before the wedding in September 1987, he belatedly realised that he hadn’t organised one.So we set off that night on an impromptu outing.We chose to visit the drinking dens of Soho — believe me, it was much seedier then than it is now.There were four of us — the groom, myself, his brother, Jo, and an Eton friend.Wild horses wouldn’t drag from me the truth of what went on that night. (‘Omerta, omerta,’ I hear Boris say.) You’ll have to wait for Boris’s memoirs to find out.Suffice to say it was a spectacular farce commensurate with what happened a week later at the wedding when he had to borrow a pair of trousers from a guest and lost his ring at the reception.One of Johnson’s predecessors as a scholar at Balliol was Aldous Huxley, author of that great dystopian novel Brave New World. How apt that next Tuesday, Boris Johnson could be ushering in his own brave new world for this country.Yes, I always believed he was destined for high office but not even my old Oxford self would have dared to believe that Britain’s future would one day lie in this infuriatingly paradoxical man’s hands."},{"url":null,"title":"Meet man named three Apollo 11 astronauts","story":"Share this article Two days later, her youngest son was born, and proud parents Diana and Edgar said the children could choose his name.

It’s not the first time she has been late to the party. “It took me a long time to get any recognition at all,” says the artist, who was into her 40s before she made her first sale. “But, when you get recognition much later, you have a lot of time to do whatever the hell you want, which leads to a better understanding of what your work is.”In the Yorkshire city of Wakefield, the destination for her first commissioned installation in the UK, shoppers seemed a little unsure what to make of the strange humanoid figure that is currently occupying of a stretch of pavement between the town hall and a first world war memorial. And it’s true that the two-tone bronze statue, commissioned as a centrepiece of the Yorkshire Sculpture International, looks oddly tentative, as if it has been beamed in from some intergalactic battlefield in an episode of Doctor Who and can’t quite believe where it has landed.Bhabha works in many media – from sculpture to drawing and photography – but, once you have seen her work, there is no mistaking it. Born in Pakistan, she has spent most of her adult life in the US, where she now lives in upstate New York with her artist husband Jason Fox and their two dogs. She is an obsessive snapper-up of abandoned objects and flits across cultures, drawing from science fiction movies as well as from ancient mythologies.At the Met, her two exhibits included an 18ft-long version of one of her best-known pieces, Benaam (Urdu for “unnamed”) – a prone figure that could be a veiled woman at prayer, and which she has used previously to memorialise the victims of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. “It’s about the endless wars and the endless killings of innocent people,” she says. Two years ago, the Tate became the first British national gallery to buy her work, investing in a 2006 cyclops head called A Man of No Importance.The Wakefield piece is titled Receiver, and though at first it appears to be a space traveller still plugged into its earphones, the closer you look, the more it begins to resemble an ancient Hindu icon washed ashore after centuries at sea. It is androgynous and faces both ways, with two pairs of arms, one down by its side, the other folded across its belly. “I like that it’s at a crossroads so it’s almost like a traveller, a receiver, with people driving, walking, stopping by,” says Bhabha. But no sooner had it settled into Wakefield than it (or, rather, an identical copy) popped up again in Regent’s Park, London, where it has a rather different vibe: as part of Frieze Sculpture 2019, it’s an exotic among exotics, which appears to have thrown a nearby monkey puzzle tree into a flailing tizzy with its badass reflection on the vulnerability of cork.For all that the figure is cast in bronze, Receiver was originally carved from cork and Styrofoam, hence its pitted brown legs and its strafed blue torso and head. Bhabha’s studio is full of found materials that might one day come in useful, and she is unafraid to capitalise on happy accidents. The Unnamed materialised out of a lump of clay and the black plastic sheet she was using to keep it moist and workable. A Man of No Importance is a mashup of materials including animal bones and a car headlight.She made her first cork sculpture in 2008. “There was a stationery store going out of business close by where I live,” she says. “He was an old man and the store had been around since the 1960s. He had these blocks that he would use for display. It was 10 to 15 dollars for a bunch of cork. So I bought it, though I didn’t know what I was going to do with it.”At the time she hadn’t done any carving, “so it lay around in my studio, and I thought the best thing to do was to glue the pieces together into a column and see if I could carve it. Then one thing led to another and he sold me all he had.” When her supplies of cork ran out it struck her that foam panels used for packing and insulation had some of the same qualities. “I realised they looked very good together, so I just kept doing it.”She’s reluctant to talk politics, preferring to allow her work to speak for itself. Receiver certainly fulfils Yorkshire curator Clare Lilley’s promise of “something bronze and distressed, referring to the turbulent world around us”. But there is also a pragmatic politics in Bhabha’s rescue of commonplace materials and abandoned objects, which is reflected in the siting of the piece in the city centre, far from any other exhibits. It stands close to Wakefield College, which is part of a collaboration between the Yorkshire sculpture festival and local schools and universities to get sculpture back into education after years of being sidelined because of the price of materials. This is a crossroads through which students pass, their heads encased in earphones like Receiver’s.Bhabha’s work is a demonstration that sculptural ambition doesn’t have to cost the Earth. Unusually in the world of monumental installations, she does all her work herself, only recently hiring an assistant to glue the blocks together. Receiver was cast in London, and she travelled there to distress the bronze further with bright daubs of paint that could be graffiti or tribal markings. “I’m not a purely conceptual artist. I’m a formalist and very much someone who works with my hands,” she says. “I’m not interested in putting objects together or illustrating a theory. I’m a traditional female artist. I’ve been making art for a decent amount of time and I like the fact that my work looks like my work.”Importantly, for the would-be sculptors of Wakefield and beyond, she is adept at playing with the illusion of grandeur: “I’m interested in the idea of monuments, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they have to be on a monumental scale.”• Huma Bhabha’s Receiver is outside County Hall, Wakefield, until 29 September and at Frieze Sculpture, Regent’s Park, London, until 6 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a9a775753fe3d4963d01187665bc13ee1b784b/252_0_1425_855/master/1425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43ab0c24e39c9ac7eb5246197d05fb58","title":"the pioneering female photographer ida wyman in pictures","story":"The US documentarian has died aged 93.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Good news from Kemster, who is “thoroughly enjoying” Frank Herbert’s Dune:World-building and story telling of the highest order and not the “hard” sci-fi tome I was expecting at all. It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book.It’s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I’m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it’s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read!I recently read and loved Emilia Pine’s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections.Meanwhile, greenmill has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre:… having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages. Not my usual thing but thoroughly enjoyed it.Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano has engrossed and challenged writeronthestorm:I’ve almost finished Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano - this is one of the bleakest fiction books I’ve read for quite some time. Yet, it is strangely engrossing. The story centres on what happens to people involved with, or connected to, the abduction of two young boys. The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It’s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff!This Body’s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to pubbore:It’s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I’m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it.Finally, Swelter has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis’ Fiction and the Reading Public:I’m enjoying it immensely. Leavis is a militant and unapologetic champion of the “highbrow”: ‘Those novels which have some pretensions to literary merit and can be criticised by serious standards (it is common even in literary circles to fling the epithet ‘highbrow’ at it).’In order to demonstrate the universality of the belief that, in the 1920s and 1930s, the most popular literature is invariably the worst, she quotes Arnold Bennett (Evening Standard July 19th, 1928):‘Nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.’Elsewhere she accuses Bennett’s literary column of being one of the forces, along with book-of-the-month clubs, that perpetuate and codify “middlebrow” literature.Nearly all bookish people are snobs? What kind of know-nothing would write that?If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Boeing’s top-selling plane, with around 5,000 on order worldwide, was pulled from service after an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa in March that killed all 157 people on board. It was the 737 Max’s second disaster in five months, after 189 people were killed on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October.Elsewhere this week, it became clear that restoring trust among passengers could take longer than fixing the plane. In Washington, relatives of passengers who died in the Ethiopian disaster told Congressional hearings that Boeing had focused on profits “at the expense of human life”. In a blistering attack on the manufacturer and the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Paul Njoroge, who lost five family members including his wife and three children in the crash, warned that, without change, “another plane will e to the ground, killing me, you”.Boeing released an initial $50m (£40m) in compensation for the bereaved on Wednesday, as part of a $100m fund it has set aside for victims’ families. The aerospace group also announced on Thursday it would take a $4.9bn charge reflecting the cost of compensation to airlines for schedule disruptions and a slowdown in production.Weeks of silence on the software issues at the centre of the crash investigations will worry airlines. Investigators are focusing on the 737 Max’s new anti-stall software, the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to keep the aircraft stable in flight. In both cases they suspect that the MCAS software – which automatically pushes the aircraft’s nose down to guard against a loss of lift – was activated by erroneous data from a single sensor. This forced the aircraft into es that the pilots, ultimately, could not stop.In the wake of the Lion Air crash in October, Boeing started work on a fix. But in late June, when Boeing and the FAA appeared to be reaching a conclusion, they instead revealed a second flaw had been discovered, beyond MCAS. It was another “potential source of uncommanded stabiliser motion”. Or, another way the plane’s computers might battle unwitting pilots in the cockpit, should it think its nose would be better pointing down.According to the global airline body, Iata, restoring the plane to service would take another five weeks from regulatory approval by the FAA. Boeing hopes to present its full bid for recertification in September, but the US carriers’ rescheduling moves show they do not envisage an immediate sign-off.Approval is likely to be checked by non-US regulators, virtually all of whom grounded the plane before the FAA. That schism caused profound concern in the aviation industry and the FAA is unlikely to go it alone now. Iata, which hosted a summit to urge regulators to align, warned that aviation relied on “mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators ... Restoring public confidence demands it.”Retraining 737 Max pilots is another moot question. The Max was sold as an upgrade to the existing, bestselling 737, rather than as a new type: removing the expense of extra training, beyond a short iPad session. Many pilots doubt this was enough – redoubled since the Ethiopian crash, where flight crew had followed Boeing’s instructions and reminders after the Lion Air disaster. Should Boeing and the FAA decide it necessary to refer Max pilots to simulators – even as a confidence-restoring measure – further delays would ensue. This would hit early adopters such as Norwegian, who are deep in the red and desperate for the economies the Max would bring.Some have more radical suggestions. Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and former US presidential candidate, whose grand-niece Samya Stumo died in the Ethiopia crash, has demanded a full, transparent review of the aircraft before recertification. He says the review should be overseen by a public panel including victims’ families, pilots, cabin crew and mechanics, as well as the FAA experts.Some think the plane may never fly again – at least as the Max. Donald Trump has already tweeted a suggestion to change the name. Boeing executives at June’s Paris Air Show appeared to consider a rebrand, but the idea was slapped down by the boss. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said he did not “see the need”, adding: “This is not a marketing or branding exercise. Certainly it impacts the public view, but the most important thing is safety.”Yet a Ryanair Max 200 emerging from the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, this week had the designation “737-8200” on the nose cone, instead of the 737 Max seen on other planes. Who oversaw the paint job remains a mystery. Boeing indicated it was a question for Ryanair, but O’Leary later said it was “nothing to do with us ... We just put the names and a big Ryanair on them.”O’Leary does not anticipate customer concerns when the planes are certified and delivered, pointing to the example of the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 was temporarily grounded due to safety concerns in 2013 but is now popular with the public, he said. Likewise, the Max “will be warmly welcomed by passengers who fly on them”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b3ea480ac45d505f5cce54ddb6978fe3f21002/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f9115a7babbf4e8f640f015313ad8ee","title":"london officials ban segregated play areas in future housing developments","story":"Exclusive: Move follows  report that social tenants were being banned from using facilities Segregated play spaces are to be banned in all future London housing developments, the Greater London Authority (GLA) has revealed this week.The policy, part of the London Plan for developers and local authorities across the city, follows outrage across the political spectrum at the case of the Lilian Baylis estate in Kennington.  Cities reported that families living in the social housing side of the estate were not allowed to use the play area or any communal spaces on the development.Henley Homes, the company that built the wall iding the estate, have since removed it and last week paid for a party for all residents to apologise for the segregation.Under the new policy developments, where there are a mix of tenures – private owners alongside “affordable” housing including shared ownership and social rented accommodation – developers will no longer be allowed to build play areas that are accessible only to people in the most expensive properties.Sadiq Khan told the  “it is disgraceful that children who live in the same development would ever be prevented from playing together”. He said he had told developers segregated development is morally unacceptable.“The policies in my draft new London Plan are absolutely clear that new developments should be inclusive to all. They are explicit that play space should never be segregated by tenure,” Khan added.Sian Berry, co-leader of the Green party, previously raised the issue of segregated spaces when she was a London Assembly member. She said the fight by women on the Lilian Baylis estate had sparked real change.“This is a campaign that has genuinely made a difference. It will have an impact that ripples through the decades,” she said. “People buying new housing should expect to rub shoulders with other Londoners of all kinds and their children should be able to play together. This makes it very clear how we expect builders and developers to protect our values as a city.”However, campaigners say the new policy has not fully resolved the problem because it will have no impact on estates that have already been built or are in development.In March the  was contacted by people across the UK reporting segregation on their estates.In Greenwich, families in social and affordable housing on the Seren Park Gardens estate have failed to gain access to a gated podium play space.The housing association, Moat Homes, argue the affected block is a separate development. It said in a statement: ‘They are separate developments and all residents … have access to the amenities within their particular developments.” However, the  has seen marketing and sales material describing the blocks as forming a single development and documents promising a play area as part of planning permission.When the  visited the site, Emma, a mother of three who lives in social rented accommodation, was bringing two toddlers out to play in the car park, 100 metres from the locked playground. Emma and her neighbours feel that the affordable homes were built to meet a target but then put in a separate building so they wouldn’t have to be given access to communal spaces.To get permission to build, developers must provide a certain percentage of affordable homes. All the accommodation in the block that does not have playground access is classed as affordable. The first five floors are social housing and the rest shared ownership, with buyers paying reduced rent to Moat Homes.Emma’s neighbour Rachael, who also brings her five-year-old and one-year-old out to play on their scooters among the cars, said the residents feel discriminated against and ask: “If that is their playground, then where is ours?”Alan Camp Architects, who won an Evening Standard award for best large mixed tenure development for their involvement in the site, refused to comment. Councillor Sizwe James, cabinet member for growth and strategic development at Greenwich council said councils did not have enough power to force access.James said: “When the development plans were submitted, the developer did not indicate that the amenity areas would be segregated, nor a gate placed at the entrance to the communal garden with fob access. We are very disappointed that residents are being excluded ... however, we do not have any powers to force the developers to allow them access.”Dinah Bornat is an architect who advises developers on child-friendly design and has been pushing for the London Plan to recognise the way children use space. She praised the focus on segregation by tenure as a starting point but said the increasing number of gated communities presents an ongoing problem.Bornat said: “Banning segregated playgrounds is dynamic, responsive planning by the GLA and will make a real difference. But we want developers to think about the impact that security fobs, gates and fences all have.“We have put boundaries and barriers in the way of children playing and meeting friends. It’s time to step up and ask is that what we want?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bc59a011949da45b3805b2aee398c5e6bec63b5/0_227_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3554f5e5f97b1d74c53568b9dbcdda6b","title":"the guardian view on moon landings a new race for space","story":"The Apollo 11 mission inspired the world. What has happened in the ensuing half-century?When Neil Armstrong stepped on to the moon 50 years ago, it was down to a giant leap of political and scientific imagination. His footprints on the powdery lunar surface changed the way we saw ourselves, confirming that humanity could escape its earthly coils. The mission unleashed a dream of what we as a species might do. Yet only a dozen people have walked on the moon, all between the summer of 1969 and the end of 1972.Did we lose our primordial urge to explore? Almost certainly not – though Buzz Aldrin this week decried “50 years of non-progress”, probes have travelled to Pluto and beyond. But times have changed. The cold war rivalry that catalysed the space race vanished. The Soviet Union was first with a satellite, dog and astronaut in space. Today Washington and Moscow play the great game in the Middle East, not the heavens, although both are now contemplating a return to the moon: Donald Trump wants to make America great again by putting astronauts there by 2024, though some think China may get there first Russia talks of landing cosmonauts by 2030.If Armstrong’s stroll produced the greatest broadcast in television history, then another astronaut produced the most significant image. The picture of the Earth rising above the moon’s horizon was pivotal for environmentalism, since it induced the sense that our home planet was something to be cared for rather than plundered. Underlying the idea of living on another planet is that we might need to if we continue making a mess of the one we have.However, the treaty that governs who can do what is even older than Armstrong’s steps on the moon. Private firms and smaller nations have joined the race for the stars. Luxembourg is positioning itself to be the centre of the space business. This will need careful handling.Space isn’t what it used to be. But one image of what happened on the way to the moon in 1969 needs challenging. In celebrating the lunar landing, let’s remember that it wasn’t only buzz-cut white men who had the right stuff: behind the scenes were female mathematicians, several of them African-American, tasked with plotting the route to the moon. Without them, Mr Armstrong would never have got there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ffe681498ffc51cc8f54a030018c06a7e59e9/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f9c02598e0fb69417125a8d158bebb9","title":"woman breastfeed baby plane klm misogyny","story":"Well, I for one welcome the news: as of this week, anybody asked to cover up while breastfeeding on a KLM flight can now walk, bare-breasted, across the plane, milk firing into the air, their baby howling at their shoulder, and immediately hand that screaming, hungry, suffering child to the person who made the complaint, who must then look after that baby for the entirety of the journey while the previously breastfeeding passenger lies back, watches a film, reads their book, has a glass of wine or enjoys a much-needed nap.Because, my friends, that is precisely what I would do if someone asked me to cover myself while breastfeeding. This week, the Dutch airline KLM garnered a lactic tonne of deserved criticism after it put out a tweet stating that “to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this”. This was itself a response to one customer’s complaint, posted on Facebook, that she had been asked by a flight attendant to cover herself with a blanket – you know, like an actual fire – while breastfeeding her baby because someone else on the plane had complained.According to Islam, breastfeeding forgives you of all your minor sins. Here’s a hadith narrated by Ja’far al-Sadiq: “Every time a woman becomes pregnant, during the whole period of pregnancy she has the status of one who fasts, one who worships during the night, and one who fights for Allah with her life and possessions ... and when the period of breastfeeding the child is finished, one of the great angels of Allah taps her side and says: ‘Start your deeds afresh, for Allah has forgiven all your minor sins.’”In Judaism, the Shulchan Aruch (sometimes called the Book of Jewish Law) recommends breastfeeding for 24 months.In Hinduism, breastfeeding mothers like the goddess Parvati are found throughout the pantheon, and the ancient Sanskrit text Sushruta Samhita states: “May four oceans, full of milk, constantly abide in both your breasts, you blessed one, for the increase of the strength of the child!” So, let’s be clear: these customers of “all backgrounds” don’t appear to have any religious foundation for their squeamishness, fear, repulsion or anger. They are not speaking on behalf of any faith.Which means that what we’re talking about here is the old-fashioned culture of western, capitalist patriarchy under which a breast is often interpreted as something solely erotic, which must therefore only be visible jiggling nipple-free in music videos, or in its fetished entirety in pornography. Or perhaps we’re talking about the cultural background of angry men who find the very fleshy existence of anybody other than themselves an assault on their very soul. The sort of people who turn puce at the sight of a woman eating in public, speaking in anything louder than a whisper and otherwise taking up all that room they wanted for their own special man things.Or perhaps KLM is simply protecting the sensitivities of the sort of upstanding fellow passenger who drinks five whisky and cokes, scratches their crotch while watching their little telly, turns their headphones up high, doesn’t flush the plane toilet, pours a packet of cheese and onion crisps straight into their mouth, shouts across the aisle to call their friend Spuggie a “shirt-lifter”, leers at the flight attendant, pushes their knees into the seat in front of them and then, spotting a woman breastfeeding, decides that the smell of breastmilk is making their hangover worse.The fact is that cabin pressure within a plane sends babies into a frenzy of discomfort. While adults make be able to suck mints, chew gum or drink water, the roaring pain within an infant’s ear canal can only really be soothed by feeding – either from a bottle or a breast. With airport security as it is, those parents who can may well choose the simple, healthy and free option of breastfeeding while on a plane. The idea that some self-appointed moral arbiter can then go around the plane ordering a flight attendant to throw blankets over anybody they deem “unsuitable”, like patches of sick on a student corridor, would be laughable if it wasn’t so tiresomely bigoted.As passengers you have two options: respect the right of all parents to feed their child however they want or sit in a plane full of screaming babies and toddlers, strapped into seatbelts, disoriented, overstimulated and potentially scared, as the change of air pressure rips through their skulls like a drill. I know which I’d choose.• Nell Frizzell is a columnist and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/548579d795ffcf95b321a07726aafee9fff16426/0_129_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e1fd3a68dfddf44eebb59769b5705f","title":"trevor horn webchat post your questions now","story":"The 80s hitmaker and creative force behind the Buggles, the Art of Noise and many others will be answering your questions at 1pm BST on 23 JulyHe’s credited as the man who invented the 80s – or at least its sound, thanks to his early acquisition of a Fairlight sampler and a LinnDrum machine. Whoever else might lay claim to that title, Trevor Horn certainly predicted pop’s most visual era as half of the Buggles, with their massive 1979 hit Video Killed the Radio Star, and then capitalised on it in the decade to come. He collaborated with that great pop showman, Malcolm McLaren, cofounded the ZTT label and brought the world Frankie Goes to Hollywood, with their indelible imagery and pristine knack for controversy.His work that decade is a murderers’ row of hits: ABC’s The Look of Love, Grace Jones’s Slave to the Rhythm, Godley \u0026amp Creme’s Cry, Pet Shop Boys’ Left to My Own Devices. He might as well have been the guy who invented the 90s, too: as part of the Art of Noise from 1983, Horn pioneered the sampling technology that would change the sound and scope of hip-hop in the years to come.His success continued through the 90s – Horn was behind Seal’s eponymous debut album – and into unexpected places in the early 2000s: ersatz Russian lesbians tATu’s English market debut, 200kmh in the Wrong Lane, contains three Horn productions, and is an underrated millennium-era classic.For better or worse (probably for better, to be fair), Lena Katina and Julia Volkova don’t appear on Horn’s most recent album, Trevor Horn Reimagines the Eighties, which employs Robbie Williams, Gabrielle Aplin, All Saints and Seal, among others, to do, well, exactly what it says on the tin. That’s the album Horn is touring this month – starting at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 27 July – and the occasion for his visit to  HQ, where he will be taking your questions at 1pm BST on Tuesday 23 July.

Sometimes we haven’t got enough space in state special schools so more kids have to go to private special schools and so on, so we have got to make sure we have got the mix of provision right.”Hinds’ statement comes as county councils – most of them Conservative-led – say the additional support they have been required to find for high needs provision is cutting into other parts of their budget, while parliament’s education select committee has called for special needs funding for schools to be urgently boosted by £1.2bn.Hinds said the pressures on local authorities and schools have been emerging since the government’s 2014 reforms, which mandated support for children with education and health care plans (EHCP) and raised the age for support from 19 to 25.“Local authorities need to make sure there is the right setting for every child to help them develop to their fullest potential. There are a larger number of children getting EHCP statements and there have been other cost pressures on schools as well,” Hinds said.While the education secretary has also been lobbying the Treasury for an overall improvement in funding for schools in England, Hinds said it was well understood within the government that special needs was a top priority.“It’s about making sure we have the right amount of capital for state special schools and that we’ve got the right provision of inclusion facilities within mainstream schools, the right number of educational psychologists, there’s a whole range of things. But you need to fund it as well, you need the money that goes behind it,” Hinds said.“But these questions around high needs are really, really important. We passed the Children and Families Act in 2014, a really significant reform. That has resulted in more support for more children, which is a good thing, and there’s also more support for children after the age of 18. But it does need funding.”With a new party leader and prime minister in place next week, Hinds does not know if he will retain his post, but said: “I’d love to be able to carry on doing this job, it’s a great privilege.”The education secretary may exit as protests continue in Birmingham by parents and others over relationship education including LGBT being taught by schools. Hinds defended his department, which has been criticised for not giving schools firmer guidelines on relationships, sex and health education, leaving school leaders vulnerable to pressure from parents.“The idea that schools decide what they teach is not a new feature of the English education system. We have never, ever, specified exactly what you are going to cover in sex education and in what year,” Hinds said.“I think we’ve got that balance about right, we came up with a set of guidance that Stonewall welcomed and the Catholic education service welcomed. In the consultation we were in close contact with the Office of the Chief Rabbi and the Association of Muslim Schools as well as teaching unions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12da96b08b677e7f862d0dba73f9f5d0fbf9498d/0_128_1821_1093/master/1821.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c7d150232b3078336addc428d1e6b1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Firebugs in Russia, monkeys in India and penguin visitors in a New Zealand sushi shop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fa6929f03e79198c616ca1df45173bbcc6ae1b/0_3_2846_1707/master/2846.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=90ff7db01df68dddc53eb4e1fa1c0719","title":"cats trailer universal pictures andrew lloyd webber musical film adaptation","story":"Critics have savaged the first look at Tom Hooper’s Andrew Lloyd Webber film, yet an extreme response is catnip for a studio chasing audiences in the age of NetflixFew film trailers genuinely electrify the internet. Yet on Thursday night, first footage from Tom Hooper’s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats did exactly that.Hooper’s film has long been fancied to repeat – or even better – the success of his Les Misérables, which won three Oscars and took £353m in 2012. And since Cats was first announced three years ago, anticipation has only mounted. A first-class cast was wrangled, including Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Idris Elba and Taylor Swift. During the shoot, Swift excitedly revealed that she and her fellow actors were attending “cat school” to seem more feline. Reports of the pioneering “digital fur technology” that would be used in post-production were lapped up eagerly.But the collective hairball that met the trailer has readjusted expectations and rewritten the conversation – with the film’s special effects singled out for particular criticism (“That CGI looks like something my actual cat vomits up”). Viewers have queried the wisdom of transmogrified actors apparently retaining their own noses - and, in some cases, genitals. Dismayingly located tails added to the confusion, as did the cat-fur coat sported by Dench’s already hirsute Old Deuteronomy.Yet rather than licking its wounds, Universal Studios, which has sunk an estimated £230m into its big winter holiday release, is likely to be quietly purring. The film’s Oscar hopes may have been spayed, but its box office prospects rarely looked healthier. Aficionados of the stage show were already guaranteed to turn out in herds the catastrophe teased on Thursday means even people with a professed Cats allergy have had their appetites whetted. The film is now being billed as a must-see for the hate-watch crowd, who tend to head to cinemas en masse, on repeat and with a drink in their hand.And this is exactly the demographic targeted with increasing desperation not just by studios and distributors but multiplex owners and the chains that run their concession stalls. Two companies currently dominate cinema: Disney and Netflix. The latter keeps people indoors with so-so fare such as Bird Box and Murder Mystery. The former manages to coax them out by only making movies that demand to be seen on the big screen. Disney’s market share is currently more than a third and growing, thanks entirely to event cinema such as the Avengers movies and Star Wars, whose ninth episode will be Cats’ biggest competition this Christmas.Universal knows that a ticket is still a ticket even if it’s been bought by rubbernecker. And it’s not the only one. Earlier on Thursday, Paramount Pictures dropped the first look for Top Gun: Maverick, the belated Tom Cruise sequel, 34 years after the release of the original. Another prime cut of spectacle cinema, in which Paramount will have placed considerable hopes – and funds.But by Friday morning, there was little talk of Top Gun 2 – on Twitter, at least. The return of the biggest film star in the world to his most-loved role had been scorched by the sight of Judi Dench in whiskers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c62ba0b40dedab7b8796e43e108e2e27e8ba2c/169_0_788_473/master/788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0566245fcad405ff92336b784b2ef572","title":"feline queasy 10 urgent questions about the cats trailer","story":"If you saw the Cats trailer last night, you won’t have slept and may still be shaking. Here, we begin the process of trying to understand what happenedThere was a time in your life before you saw the Cats trailer. That’s hard to believe, I know. It might feel as if your every waking moment since birth has been plagued by monstrous visions of howling piliferous, sexualised Brundleflies, but I assure you this is merely a blip. Soon, some other supposedly prestigious director will release a trailer for another terrible musical where the cast have been digitised to look nightmarish and half-formed, and you will move on.In the meantime, I have some questions about the Cats trailer.This shouldn’t be difficult. In TS Eliot’s poetry collection Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, the cats are the size of cats. In the stage musical Cats, the cats are the size of people. But here? It’s hard to know. In one shot, a cat just about fits into a standard dustbin (too big for a cat), another gets its paw stuck in a standard mousetrap (the correct size for a cat). Then there’s this shot, where an entire cat is roughly the size of a standard dining knife (too small for a cat, much too small for a cat). How the hell are audiences supposed to enjoy Cats if they’re constantly trying to discern scale, Tom Hooper?Did Dench specifically grow out her fur so that she could cut it off and make it into a coat for her to wear, even though that would be redundant because she was already wearing the fur? Or did she seek out a number of cats with identical fur to hers – maybe even her own relatives – and brutally skin them so she could wear them as a garment? Is Dame Judi Dench the Ed Gein of cats? Logically, it has to be one or the other.“Remember Catwoman? She’s sexy, right?”“Yes Tom, she’s sexy”.“Could we make our cats as sexy as Catwoman?”“I’m not sure that would work, Tom. Catwoman is a woman who simply assumes feline characteristics, whereas the cats in Cats are literally cats.”“I get it. It’s OK to want to have sex with Catwoman, because when she takes her clothes off she’s a naked human being. But it isn’t OK to want to have sex with a cat, because cats are already naked, and if they take their fur off then they’re just pulsating masses of blood and sinew?”“Nah, screw it, let’s give them tits anyway.”By now, Rebel Wilson has played the exact same character in about 300 films. The repetition of having to be the clumsy, too-confident, overweight comic relief again and again, no matter the film, must be exhausting. So she must have been thrilled to get a call to play a role in a tentpole film by the Oscar-winning director of Les Misérables. Except, oh, wait, no, she’s playing the exact same character in this as well. Still, at least this character is covered in a kind of harrowing woodland moss. That’s something, right?Finally, a question with an answer. James Corden did not vomit into another cat’s face. James Corden spat food into another cat’s face. I hope this helps.Jason Derulo, performer of hits like Swalla, Wiggle and That’s My Shhh? Jason Derulo, deliverer of the lyric “Is it weird that your bra reminds me of a Katy Perry song”? Jason Derulo, whose biggest screen role until now has been playing Ronald Dawson in one episode of the little-loved television adaptation of Lethal Weapon? Yes. That Jason Derulo.Hugely. Enormously. With every atom of her being. Hudson’s rendition of Memory in the Cats trailer – performed in the manner of someone standing on a motorway bridge trying to warn motorists of a cow in the road – is clearly meant to be this film’s answer to Anne Hathaway’s I Dreamed a Dream moment in Les Misérables. That performance won Hathaway an Oscar. However, that was because Hathaway was playing an orphaned sex worker who has to sell her own teeth to feed her daughter, set against the backdrop of France’s violent June Rebellion and not, say, a funny cat in a film about cats.Oh, that’s right, I’m involuntarily peeling the skin off them because apparently that sensation is preferable to looking at any more footage of screaming, digitally augmented, uncanny valley feline hell-mutants. This trailer made me vomit, and wet myself, and now I’m peeling the skin off my own hands. Are you happy now, Tom Hooper?• Cats is in cinemas in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ffcbe43ca256b5128c62b4fc4ad5c09fe31929/0_392_4291_2574/master/4291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae77dcde3ecfbad9a7362201a5090e95","title":"cocktail of the week london cocktail clubs club tropicana recipe","story":"This Club Tropicana is free – of alcohol, at least – but the sultry smoothie is still packed full of party flavoursThis will wake you up before you go-go – Club Tropicana is more than just a song by Wham!

Their performances over the past month merit the accolade and that much cannot be denied the pity was that they dropped any pretensions towards making this final a footballing spectacle after going ahead through Baghdad Bounedjah’s heavily deflected early goal, the result being a tedious encounter that grabbed the attention only during those few episodes when it seemed Senegal might punish their voracious lust for attrition.It all amounted to a colossal riding of their luck but also a personal triumph for Djamel Belmadi, their impressive coach, who took the job only last August but has delivered a continental title where none was expected. He celebrated with his players, who raced towards a delirious 15,000-strong travelling support at full-time, while his childhood friend Aliou Cissé held a lengthy on-pitch debrief after narrowly failing to deliver Senegal a first title of their own.Cissé might have had better fortune if the referee, Neant Alioum, had not reversed a second-half penalty award, given when the ball struck Adlene Guedioura’s right arm, after a VAR consultation. Spot kicks have certainly been awarded for less in major finals this year. But ultimately Senegal ran into too many of the traps Algeria set for them and the moments when Sadio Mané, as well as the rest of a vaunted front line, could influence proceedings were vanishingly rare.“I’m so happy for my people, who have waited for such a long time,” Belmadi said. “We have won the cup outside our country for the first time. If you look at where we came from, I took a team that faced difficulties. To achieve what we have achieved, to finish on top of Africa, I have to say it is excellent.”Despite the deeply frustrating fare they produced, this was indisputably a meeting of the tournament’s two best teams. In the end Algeria capitalised on the slight edge they held.They had beaten Senegal by a single goal in the group stage and repeated the trick through their one attempt of the game, a moment that briefly confused the stadium into silence.Boundejah’s burst down the inside-left channel past Lamine Gassama oozed menace but the shot he produced after cutting inside, which looped high into the air off Salif Sané, seemed destined for the athletics track behind the goal. But it spun downwards sharply, eventually dropping into the far corner, and the dawning realisation took a few moments to morph into unbridled delight.Sané, injured earlier in the tournament, had returned to the starting lineup in place of the suspended Kalidou Koulibaly and Senegal’s weakness had been highlighted in the unluckiest fashion.It did not take a doctorate in Algerian football ethics to ine that, from there, Belmadi’s side might seek to niggle this all the way out. They have played some fine attacking football in Egypt and such a grim final does not erase any of that. But few have quite as firm a handle on the dark arts and they successfully squeezed the air out of what followed.“They say you don’t play finals, you win them,” Belmadi said. “I don’t really believe that. We prepared and wanted to play against this talented team, Senegal. It wasn’t our best match. We didn’t have ball possession nor impose our play.”In fairness it made some sense to cede the initiative to Senegal, for whom guile has long been an achilles heel. If their opponents began to get too clever, Algeria simply stuck spokes in the works. Aissa Mandi felled Mané with a crude challenge led from the knee and Ismaïla Sarr found himself on the end of a hack from Ramy Bensebaini. Sofiane Feghouli collapsed near the goalline before dusting himself down when sympathy proved in short supply. When tempers briefly flared on the half-time whistle, their substitute goalkeeper Alexandre Oukidja took a dramatic tumble while Cissé and Mandi argued their way down the tunnel.The break felt like a relief from the sheer cynicism of it all but the game did open up enough for Senegal to believe they had found a way back. Sarr, their best attacker on the day, made excellent ground down the right before seeing his cross hit Guedioura inside the area. It recalled Mané’s slice of fortune for Liverpool in Madrid two months previously but this time, after a delay of around a minute, Alioum opted to restart with a drop ball.“We played well and had our chances over the course of the match but against this aggressive bloc we couldn’t find a solution,” Cissé said. Mbaye Niang, from a tight angle after rounding Rais Mbolhi, and Sarr did spurn opportunities to make Algeria regret stalling to such an extreme degree. By the conclusion, though, their dirty work had been done to a strange, unsatisfactory perfection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04d8b9c5f4e5879f649edd58ba2a890b8be6389/0_428_5700_3421/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e966581a99b5c15892f2b6b19c8911","title":"irritating friends are the best","story":"I’ve been on a hen weekend with old pals, drinking through penis straws on a chilly beach in a world of our ownI had been thinking about my friends from secondary school, about how rare it is to have lasting friendships and how some relationships that I thought mattered had folded under the feeble pressure of an awkward conversation or a missed party. Yet here we were, together. The Girls. A miracle, I thought, before a question popped in: do I really like these people?A hen weekend is a testing environment. There are some experiences you can’t row back from, and shivering on a British beach in a cape, drinking through a penis straw, is one of them.I can see these friends for what they are: despots. There’s the Organisational Despot, the dictator who tightly follows the schedule no one asked her to make the Fun Enforcer, the mafiosa who is never far from a prop, with an expression that reads, “Have fun! Or else.” And the Obscure Dietary Requirement Tyrant, who keeps us all eating lettuce through sheer fear of her gluten-induced rage. Obstinate, unreasonable autocrats, I think. How do they survive in this world?The truth is, the world of our friendship is not like the real world. Our patch of reality has different rules. In our bubble, we’re allowed to be our worst, our most human. This is rare. Why do we put on an act for so many people? Why do we behave less fussy or pretend we’re busy when we just don’t want to go out?Perhaps we fear that the love might not last if we show them our true selves. Although I sometimes long for the pleasantries of fairweather friends, I’ve learned that it’s a gift to have pals who feel they can be so freely irritating.

Here’s a quick guide to the key relationshipsEveryone in the UK is a friendless loser. Not my words, but those (slightly paraphrased) of a recent Snapchat survey that found British people have fewer close mates than other nationalities. With 2.6 “best friends” on average, compared with the frankly excessive 6.6 boasted by participants in Saudi Arabia, and one in seven of us reporting no best friends at all, the results paint a damning portrait of a seemingly lonely populace. A nation of Briton-no-mates.Mind you, new research by MIT reckons humans can only cope with a maximum of five close friends, so we wouldn’t know what to do with more even if we had them. These findings corroborate 1990s research by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who suggested a correlation between brain size and social relationships. In other words: humans are only capable of having a finite number of people in our social sphere at any given time, because we’re all a bunch of numpties. Now, I’m no scientist, but based on how dramatically my stress levels spike whenever I receive more than one text message before 11am, I’d say that checks out.Despite being a significant cornerstone of a healthy social life, friends can be strangely transitory. From our first encounters in infant school, when we bond over crayons and crisps, to agonising encounters in our 20s, when we bond over sexual attraction and hating the same people on Twitter, the makeup of our social circles will change in accordance with how we – hopefully – evolve as iniduals.That first core group becomes a rotating cast. Some may remain as key protagonists, others are recurring characters, and there will inevitably be many, many regrettable cameos. But in these fraught, isolationist times, let us take a moment to consider our mates. Who are they and what can they tell us about ourselves?Our first comrade of convenience, the School Friend enters our life before we’ve had time to develop a personality. This is especially cruel because these are also our most formative years, so everyone remembers everything. Think of all the names you still know in full, the faces you remember, the houses you can still picture, the girl you were briefly close with in year 5 because you got put in maths together and spent the entire class trying to see how many dicks you could draw on a rubber – and then basically never spoke to again. Mad, really, how GCSE results day isn’t also accompanied by a gracious ceremony in which everyone has their memory erased, Men In Black-style. Seems like an oversight.Once you do start to find yourself, these early connections go one of three ways: you drift apart in secondary school and never hear about them again until your mum bumps into their mum in Sainsbury’s you stay friends long enough to have each other on Facebook, where you occasionally like photos of their baby or you stay friends for ever, know them best of anyone in the world, and are ultimately tasked with delivering a thoughtful but humorous eulogy at their funeral, during which you break the tension by calling them an “old git” for dying first.You see them the most, talk to them the most and have the most in-jokes with them because you spend eight hours a day, five days a week together in the same shipping container office spaceon Slackbehind a bar. But, at the same time, they know the least about you. You have a shared language, a veritable buffet of niche references, but they couldn’t tell you how many siblings you have, or how old you are. In fact, if it weren’t for the office email, would they even know your last name?You will have lunch together twice a week for three years until one of you resigns, and then you will never see them again until you bump into them at Latitude, where you have precisely one beer and realise the only thing you had in common was complaining about the work toilets.An extremely shallow, but incredibly pivotal, relationship, the Sesh Friend is the person who, regardless of time or place, can always be relied on to respond to your Bat-Signal text: “’Spoons?”These are people you don’t know on any real level, but still share a wealth of emotional experiences with, always ending up on the same tired sofa at afterparties, watching old Talking Heads performances on YouTube while they describe a podcast they once listened to about doppelgängers. Never underestimate the bonding agent that is cracking open the last Tyskie to share as the sky turns cold.Beyond these semi-deep 5am experiences, you have no involvement with them whatsoever. You have never once met for coffee, would never dream of lending each other money, and the only chats you have outside of the sesh are regarding where to meet for the sesh.The Internet Friend is basically the inverse of Sesh Friend they know everything about you except what you’re actually like. They’re clued up on the tedious minutiae of your life – what aesthetic you’re feeling at the moment, what mood you were in at 6.19pm last Tuesday, how you couldn’t have a burrito for lunch because the place around the corner from your office was closed for some reason. You exchange playlists, long emails, constant DMs perhaps you even send each other gifts in the post. But they have no idea about your physical presence, your tics and mannerisms, the geometry of your face cracking into a smile at that gif of a puppy jumping into a bush.Nevertheless, the Internet Friend holds an enormous amount of weight. The distance means you often tell them things you might find difficult to say IRL, especially if you spend a lot of time online because you’re struggling in your social life. Whether you met them on Tumblr, in a forum for people with a specific medical condition, or through a zealous appreciation of each other’s crap tweets, the Internet Friend can be a guiding light, offering support from the other side of the world. At certain points, you might even call them your closest friend.Until you meet them, that is. Never do that.University is a microcycle of your entire life in friendships. You spend the first year talking to everyone, throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks. By the second year, you might have two or three different socials circles that overlap, Venn diagram-like, containing people you like to varying degrees.By the third year, you can’t be arsed. By now, there are about four people on the entire campus you get on with, and you’re too tired to keep putting in work with the rest. The likelihood of those four people genuinely enjoying each other’s company is even slimmer, so you spend the last 12 months of your degree either enjoying one-on-one hangouts, or going out in massive groups of people whose names you’ll struggle to remember when tagging your graduation photos.Too many of us feel compelled to stick around people we don’t like simply because they’ve been there for ages, or we did, at one point, consider them a friend – but frankly, life’s too short for that. If you’re fundamentally at odds with someone, stop forcing those awkward monthly catch-ups at Costa, the ones that end with a Kardashian-style barny because you said something uncomplimentary about their new squeeze, and cut them out. Who has the time?Equally, though – is there any greater driving force for success than hatred? Do the achievements of a frenemy not spur you to greater heights? Do your own achievements not then feel even sweeter? Ultimately, a frenemy’s value is dependent on how you fare on bitterness and competition. If the answer is “I thrive”, then these might be the greatest relationships of your life. Why do you think Fleetwood Mac were so successful?Twitter user @queentrashcan recently defined the background friend in a viral post, which read: “i don’t fit in with any particular group of friends. they all are closer with each other and i sometimes link on but am permanent with no one. i think about all these people constantly but i don’t think i cross their minds often.”Basically the concept is: a lone wolf who has no established friendship group. This is someone you always say hello to on a night out, ask who they’re with, then realise it’s you. While you have nothing but good things to say about this person, you rarely invite them anywhere because someone else always seems to. Everyone assumes the background friend is better friends with someone else, while the background friend themselves is elusive familiar to many groups, but a key player in none. Big Donnie Darko energy.Honestly, though, I’m not convinced this is a real thing. People are emotionally stunted and rarely vocalise what other people mean to them, so I would argue that the background friend is a state of mind more often than it is an identity. Then again, who among us has not had a quiet moment in the toilet at a house party, thousand-yard staring into the cabinet mirror, worrying that, if you died tomorrow, there might be no one who knows your favourite song is Californication.There are some notable downsides to being a new parent: the temporary dip in sexual activity, sleep deprivation, having to raise a healthy, happy baby in the context of humanity’s uncertain future on our rapidly dying planet. But the worst has to be taking your kid to playgroup and having to talk to other parents. And so, for a time, you will spend several hours a week listening to Karen talk about getting reiki for her swollen feet, and you will smile politely, and say, “Oh, that’s interesting” even if it isn’t, because she’s the only adult company you’ve had all week.These are the ultimate in circumstantial friends – like partners of friends, or the relatives of long-term partners, whom you must accept as your own, despite having nothing in common.Best friends comprise the most fulfilling, longstanding and volatile relationships of your life. These are the legends who will support you unequivocally when you’re going through a rough time, but will also tell you when you’re behaving like an arsehole or have food in your teeth. Of course, the closer you are, the deeper the arguments – but, ultimately, these are the smug bastards who know you better than you know yourself. A best friend will listen to your worst thoughts and not judge. A best friend will rib you when you need humbling, and cook for you when you’re down in the dumps. Most importantly though, a best friend will let you post a photo on Instagram in which you look great but they look truly awful, because they know you’re trying to pull someone.

Recent converts to diets with less meat explain their motives There is a scene in the documentary Blue Planet II where a harlequin tuskfish, a 30cm long inhabitant of the Great Barrier Reef, uses a bump on a coral to break open a clam.The coral is littered with broken clam shells. The fish clearly uses this spot a lot. It strikes the coral repeatedly until the clam gives way.The scene lasts three minutes and ends with a quiet word from Sir David Attenborough. “So here is a fish that uses tools,” he says. “Some fish are much cleverer than you might suppose.”Sitting on his couch in Rockingham, Western Australia, Craig Buchanan was astonished. “It blew me away that fish could do something as complex as that,” he says.It was a few days after Christmas in 2017. Buchanan had never given much thought to the ethical implications of eating meat before, but he couldn’t get that little fish out of his head.“Just the thought that something that small with a brain that small as well could actually do that, I had never paused to think about it,” he says.A few days later he set himself a new year’s resolution of trying a vegetarian diet for a week. Both he and his wife thought he would give up after a few days. Two weeks later, he still hadn’t eaten meat.“I just said to myself then: look, if you can do it and you’re not really missing anything (other than bacon) can you justify going back?” he says. “And I thought, I probably can’t. If you’re still enjoying sitting down to dinner then what’s the point in reverting?”Buchanan is probably not who the National party had in mind when it railed against the growth of fake-meat products in Australian supermarkets (although he agrees that it’s confusing to shelve such products alongside real meat). A Liberal party staffer and former federal Liberal candidate, he says he is “about as far removed from being a bleeding heart small-l liberal as you could expect to find”.But he is one of a growing number of Australians who have decided to cut down, or cut out, the meat or other animal products in their diet.Recent converts told  Australia they were motivated by animal welfare concerns, anxiety over the climate crisis, concerns about factory farming and, in some cases, convenience. A number cited Dominion, a documentary by an Australian filmmaker connected to recent protests and trespass on agricultural properties that has been criticised as “misleading” by the National Farmers Federation.Georgina Laidlaw watched a three-part Attenborough documentary on the Galapagos Islands before booking a holiday there in May 2015. She lives on a small acreage near Ballarat and began killing her own ducks and chickens for meat in 2007. She was “more in touch with the death part of eating meat than a lot of people”, she says.But she couldn’t reconcile those habits with her experience in the Galapagos.“Every day you are surrounded by animals there and you are busy taking photos of them and looking at them through binoculars and swimming with them and spending money to do specifically that, and then I would come back at night and eat the best ceviche of my life,” she says. “It just didn’t make any sense.”She already avoided mass-produced meat, but returned home as a vegetarian. The hardest part, she says, was overcoming her fear of being impolite by informing family and friends that they might have to cater separately to her.Thankfully the rise of foodie culture, and specifically the celebrity chef Yotam Ottolenghi, a longtime food columnist for the , has eased the way. Gone are the sludgy lentil soups that characterised western vegetarianism in the 1970s. Even meat eaters will happily cook an Ottolenghi concoction, or queue for trendy vegan restaurants such as Smith \u0026amp Daughters in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy.But while she has found being a vegetarian easy to manage, veganism is off the cards.“If I got rid of eggs and dairy I would be eating tofu at every turn, and that sounds like the title of a horror novel,” she says.She has no truck with fake meat products. Buchanan, on the other hand, appears to have tried all of them. He can recommend the best burger (“Linda McCartney, hands down”) the best fake fish (“Quorn have just brought out some absolutely lovely fish fillet options”) and the best vegan bacon.The bacon was a sticking point. “Someone swore to me that coconut chips were the way to go,” he says. “Little slices of coconut with bacon salt on them? Absolutely ghastly.“For the first second and a half you get the taste of bacon then you get very much soggy coconut ... I had so much trouble giving the tub away.”(He says Lamyong bacon strips are “pretty close, if you like your bacon overdone”.)Tae Baker has been vegan for three months. She took a 30-day online challenge after seeing the Extinction Rebellion protests that shut down Flinders Street in Melbourne as part of its global day of action on climate. She says she didn’t approve of their tactics, but was interested enough to learn more.While politicians from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, down branded protesters “un-Australian” and introduced new laws to increase penalties for “militant vegans” who trespass on farms and agricultural businesses, Baker was learning to swap Greek yoghurt for coconut or soy.“I got a fair bit of ribbing from people, especially because it was shortly after the ‘militant vegan’ media attacks,” she says. “I had friends calling me ‘my militant vegan friend’, and things like that.”The biggest challenge was overcoming her own belief that sticking to a vegan diet would be difficult.“I always thought it was too hard, and I think you can live your whole life thinking it’s too hard if you don’t try it,” she says.Instead, she says, it was “almost too easy”: vegans are now so well catered for in major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths that you can easily subsist on pre-made or processed foods. There are even vegan fast-food chains. It is easy to be an unhealthy vegan, if you’re not careful.A spokesperson for Woolworths said it had seen “double digit growth for plant-based meat alternatives in our stores over the past year, and every indication tells us this category will only continue to grow”.But processed vegan and vegetarian options are not without environmental impact. Almond plantations are drawing huge amounts of water out of the overtaxed Murray-Darling basin. Soybeans are driving deforestation. Is it truly better, from a harm minimisation standpoint, to eat tofu than meat if the Amazon was cleared to grow the soybeans? A number of vegan-friendly products, including most frozen puff pastry sheets, use palm oil as a solid vegetable fat in place of butter. Can an orangutan’s right to live undisturbed be weighed against that of a dairy cow?For those trying to minimise their impact, each new piece of information must be plugged into a complex personal moral accounting.“If you’re trying to fix all of the inequities of this world through your own personal consumption decisions you’ll go mad, because pretty much everything has exploitation and cruelty,” Tasman Stacey says.“But when there are decisions that you can make, where I can make this slight change in the way we live, at no cost or ill-consequence to myself, and it does make an improvement to the world around us, then that’s not a particularly difficult decision to take.”Stacey and his family cut down their meat consumption from five or six days a week to one or two days a week last year. The meat they do eat is mostly game like kangaroo or deer, shot by Stacey when he can manage it – a harder proposition since he moved from northern Tasmania to Canberra.Just as Laidlaw did before she stopped eating meat, Stacey draws a distinction between ethically produced meat, like wild kangaroo or specialist small free-range meat producers, and large scale agriculture. If you’re only eating meat once or twice a week, he says, you can afford a kinder product.It’s the same argument run by Matthew Evans, the food critic who starred in the Gourmet Farmer television series, in his latest book On Eating Meat.The amount that Australians spend each week on meat has dropped in real terms since 1989. Eating less, higher quality and more ethically produced meat would have benefits for people, animals and the planet alike.“I’m not trying to not eat meat because eating meat is wrong,” Stacey says. “We are eating less meat because it’s not sustainable. There’s enough resources on this world for everyone to live a comfortable and dignified life but the way that we distribute our resources globally at the moment is not sustainable, and we need to change that or get very used to the hordes of people being murdered at the border trying to escape climate catastrophe.”Alice Belin, from Brussels, decided to reduce her meat consumption for environmental reasons last year and adopted a strict lacto-ovo vegetarianism because she says she hasn’t the discipline for a more “flexitarian” approach.“I like to eat and I like to eat meat and I miss it, so I knew that wouldn’t work,” she says. Christmas in France was spent mournfully looking at the foie gras and oysters and seeking solace in the cheese buffet.Belin works for a marine environmental organisation and gave up fish some years ago. She says she does not anticipate upgrading to vegan, partly because it would feel “punitive” to remove cheese, and partly because it would necessarily increase her reliance on processed or soy-based products.“I try to be coherent in my own way of life and these products, if they’re made from an industrial process, in an industrial way, and bought in a supermarket in plastic packaging, to me that kind of cancels out the fact that I am not eating meat,” Belin says.It must be a personal choice, she says.None of the people who spoke to  Australia say they would try to persuade anyone else to give up meat. But if you are thinking about doing it, they say, it’s really not that hard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056c6c2e3694d9ada5b739cc7c646a4693c9baa0/0_177_5360_3217/master/5360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ece317df31d6d959e8c5d9cfb0a4b407","title":"lets move to hemel hempstead hertfordshire tom dyckhoff","story":"It didn’t get the best new town architecture, but you can find fragments of the old landscape threaded throughWhat’s going for it? I bought my first album in WHSmith in Hemel Hempstead. Kings Of The Wild Frontier, by Adam and the Ants, since you ask. On cassette. Like Mr Ant, Hemel was the future once. In 1980, it was in full new-town mode. To get there, Dad had to negotiate the dual carriageways, ring roads and the infamous Magic Roundabout, past the Kodak HQ, the fabulous Dacorum sports centre where I learned to doggy paddle, and perfectly manicured water meadow municipal gardens. I loved Hemel. Especially as it was two towns in one. To the north of the new town was the old town: higgledy high street, antique shops, Norman church and bow-fronted cottages. Now Hemel is three towns in one, the old town and the new town having in turn been gobbled up by the future. Hemel’s new new town is mostly composed of executive homes, Cineworld and the brassy Marlowes shopping mall. The Kodak site has become a luxury apartment complex. And doggy paddling is outgunned by “extreme sports” centres and an indoor ski centre. The future has better coffee. But, call me middle aged, I kind of preferred the past.The case against If you don’t like the postwar feel, with the 1980s grafted on, it won’t be for you.

Mobile phones are locked in pouches before entering an old warehouse building to experience a dystopian vision from grime pioneer Skepta, working in collaboration with Foxfinder playwright Dawn King, design studio TEM and “immersive performance director” Matthew Dunster for this Manchester international festival show.Dystopia987 is pitched as “a waking dream that presents Skepta’s singular vision of the future: deep, dark, radical and riveting”. Once inside the multiroom cavernous space, the walls read “free energy”, “free your mind”, “free your ego” headphones give audio instructions to “connect and let go”, asking: “When was the last time you made eye contact with a stranger?”It’s not very different from a typical nightclub experience. There’s a bar, a chill-out zone, warm up DJs pounding out techno over intense strobes, and when handing over a drinks token I’m told it’s actually for the makeup stall to get my face painted.Conceptually the show is a little muddy, because Skepta is exploring more of a utopia than a dystopia. For all the sci-fi window dressing, this is a nostalgic ideal of club culture, rather than an exploration of an unjust future world. T-shirts celebrating our dystopian state are sold at £25 a pop and mobile barmen with LED hats flashing Red Stripe wander around – it’s hard to tell whether this is a satire of rapacious commerce, or just rapacious commerce. The vibe is Secret Cinema doing a 1989 rave but replacing ecstasy with craft beer.Soon a voice booms over the speakers: “Come ... we are free!” A door opens into another huge room. A surge of excitement grows, as a massively impressive three tier floor-to-ceiling stage appears looking like a tower block crossed with an electricity pylon and a spaceship.Skepta bounces around the bottom two tiers as DJ Maximum drops beats that clatter and crack through the booming sound system. An early outing of That’s Not Me erupts ferociously, before Skepta pays tribute to the imprisoned A$AP Rocky via an impassioned Praise the Lord (Da Shine).“Everyone is going through some shit but tonight we are going to leave that outside,” he says, intent on creating a meaningful connection with his audience, but he struggles. Repeat requests for his “energy crew” almost veer into pleading at times. “Different energy tonight,” he eventually says. Shutdown ignites the room, as expected, but the quiet and almost subdued goodbye Skepta gives, at an earlier finish time than expected, feels like a weird and deflating exit.The irony of this intended inhibition-shedding experience is that it in no way comes close to the pandemonium of Skepta’s 2016 show in the same city. There, hundreds of people had phones glued to their hands, not because they were disengaged from the performance, but because they wanted to film and capture the moment that they were so completely lost in.

As a socialist feminist, the idea that one of the great movements of human liberation in our times could be reduced to getting a few more female Tory MPs into parliament is truly depressing.Gill acknowledges that Tory austerity policies have been terrible for working-class women, but makes no mention of how the scandals of Windrush, Grenfell and the hostile policy towards asylum seekers and immigrants, which can be directly traced to May’s time at the Home Office, show class politics at its most brutal and demonstrate indifference to the lives of the most vulnerable women.I could never understand those who celebrated figures like Margaret Thatcher as female firsts when she had no interest in, and actually worked against the liberation of, most women. Feminism is about taking structural inequality seriously. It needs to be allied to anti-racist and class-based solidarity movements because it is a movement for equality and justice for all women, not just a means of ensuring equal representation among the ranks of the establishment. Having a few more Tory women elected to a position where they can continue to defend their own class interests and work against most women is nothing to do with feminism as I understand it.Allegra MadgwickLondon• Martha Gill says Theresa May “stood up for victims of domestic abuse”. Is this the same Theresa May who led a government whose austerity policies resulted in funding cuts for women’s refuges, a number of which have had to close as a result? These closures will have put many women’s lives at risk.Hester DohertyShrewsbury, Shropshire• I think you are too kind to Theresa May (Editorial, 18 July). She has, on occasions, made speeches that might indicate her being “cognisant of responsibilities attached to her office”, but her actions have rarely lived up to these. As home secretary she increased the already high level of institutional racism with the hostile environment policy, and as prime minister she talked about those “just about managing” while worsening their position with increasing cuts to welfare benefits.Judy StoberBruton, Somerset• Any assessment of Theresa May’s performance over the past three years would be incomplete without noting her failure to respond adequately to the human suffering arising from the fire at Grenfell Tower. It would seem that the associated legacy is one of fading interest in resolving the safety issues in a timely fashion, and slowing down the process of requiring landlords to listen to tenants rather than just banking their rent money (Government inaction putting lives at risk after Grenfell - MPs, 18 July).Les BrightExeter, Devon• You have to wonder at the mind of a prime minister who can rail at Brexit absolutists (May swipes at ‘rancour and hatred’ of Brexit absolutists, 18 July) after fronting a minority government kept in office only by a party of the 10 most uncompromising MPs in the UK, having set her own red lines without consulting with other parties on what kind of Brexit we should have, and who put forward the same rejected plan over and over because she could conceive of no other way forward.Mark LewinskiSwaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire• Theresa May could give real effect to her “coded swipe” at the Brexiters who undermined her premiership by using her final day as prime minister to revoke article 50.Kip BennettWest Drayton, London• I note Theresa May’s advocacy of enhanced paternity leave (Journal, 19 July) and wonder if she’d consider making it compulsory.

The planned reforms are intended to dovetail with Labour’s plans to renationalise the railways, the Royal Mail and the public utilities.Gwynne will say: “Our plan will be the largest set of reforms of local government in generations, rebuilding local government capacity and giving power back to communities – because public services belong to local people, and people are more important than profit.”Labour will argue that the original justification for outsourcing – that private companies offer better value for money to taxpayers – has proved incorrect. It says the collapse of Carillion – the construction and facilities management company – in 2018 highlighted the risk of private provision, but that poor service quality and standards go beyond one-off cases. Local councils – including those in the north London borough of Islington, in Nottingham, Sefton, Halton and Stoke-on-Trent – have already been bringing services back in-house.Labour is braced for widespread opposition to its local government blueprint. But it says claims that insourcing will place unsustainable cost burdens on councils, will lead to skimping on performance, or will contravene EU law, can be answered.A policy document to be presented at the launch will list seven key attractions of insourcing:Labour says its new framework for insourcing won’t require compensation to contractors because councils will wait until contracts are up or lawfully terminated before bringing services back in-house.McDonnell will say: “After year upon year of failures the public has rightly lost confidence in the privatisation of our public services and the carve-up of the public realm for private profit. The government’s ideological pursuit of privatisation and outsourcing has seen the public pay the price as fat cat bosses count their profits.“It’s time to end the outsourcing scandal which has seen private companies rip off the taxpayer, degrade our public services and put people at risk whilst remaining wholly unaccountable to the people who rely on and fund these services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47fa556825c4dd3b1c79f0f5ad34947f8dd451a/30_740_1940_1164/master/1940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ce242f9a8373a10a2846747b338e5bf","title":"moon buggies and bags of poo what humans left on the moon","story":"After 50 years of exploration, the lunar junkyard holds nearly 200 tonnes of objectsMore than half a century of lunar exploration has left its mark on the moon.

Then there are the wreckages of spacecraft that smashed, or were crashed intentionally at the end of their missions, into the lunar surface. There are a dozen 1960s Soviet Luna probes nearly twice as many US Rangers, Lunar Orbiters, Surveyors and more recent observatories at least four Japanese spacecraft, and other robots sent from Europe, China and India. In April, the mangled remains of the first private moon mission, Israel Aerospace Industries’ Beresheet probe, became the latest addition when the lander’s gyroscopes failed.More striking are those that met a more gentle end. Besides all the wreckages strewn across the moon are robotic landers and rovers that simply fell silent, their batteries spent or their hardware worn out. The Luna 9, the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing, is there on the western edge of the near side of the moon. So is the Soviets’ magnificent, eight-wheeled Lunokhod 1, the first lunar rover, which in 1970 trundled around the Mare Imbrium, or Sea of Rains. Joining them in the lunar graveyard are Surveyor 1, the first of several American probes to land softly on the surface, and three moon buggies discarded by Apollo 15, 16 and 17. James Irwin, an Apollo 15 astronaut, left a bible on the dashboard of his mission’s buggy. The most recent rover to shut down on the moon was China’s Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, which has not been heard from since 2015.Beyond the crashed, the ditched and the broken down are pieces of equipment and personal effects that astronauts left behind. The least charming are 96 bags for poo, urine and vomit that scientists, being scientists, are keen to get their hands on should the opportunity arise. More difficult to find will be the two golf balls that the Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard hit for “miles and miles” and the metal rod, described by Nasa as a “javelin”, lobbed by Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man on the moon.The crew of Apollo 15 carried an 8.5cm-tall aluminium figure to the moon. Created by the Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck, the Fallen Astronaut was laid on its side with a plaque listing the names of astronauts and cosmonauts who died during the space race. At the end of Apollo 15’s final moonwalk, David Scott pulled out a falcon’s feather and a hammer and demonstrated Galileo’s theory that in the absence of air resistance, different objects fall at the same rate. The items are still there, along with 12 pairs of boots one hundred $2 bills taken into space as good luck charms a small gold olive branch left by Neil Armstrong as a symbol of peace and a family photo placed on the ground by Charles Duke, the Apollo 16 astronaut who in 1972 became the 10th and youngest person to walk on the moon.There is an abundance of technical junk there, too. The Apollo landing sites are littered with cameras, power packs, tongs, drills, towels, brushes, rakes and trenching tools, and scientific experiments that measured dust, seismic vibrations and the solar wind. Some of the artefacts still serve a scientific purpose. Retroreflectors installed on the moon by the Apollo astronauts and the Lunokhod 1 and 2 missions have been used to measure the Earth-moon distance with laser beams for the past 50 years.The parts and pieces that dot the surface are only the most physical remnants of humanity’s intimate encounter with the moon. Less enduring are the marks in the ground, the footprints first made 50 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc725f132be71baff7dc90fba89d7a362552c27/21_421_1865_1687/master/1865.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de2430c67f4f303de0f8aa0418f7a33d 480w","title":"engagement and connection the key to reaching scotlands addicts","story":"A number of pioneering projects suggest Scotland doesn’t need radical legal reform to stop addicts dyingEvery Monday afternoon, a steady stream of drug users at various stages of treatment gravitate to a cafe-style clinic based at a charity centre in Midlothian.Sitting around a table with their teas and coffees, their chat encompasses anything from childhood memories to last night’s telly. There is an ongoing debate about whether Lidl or Aldi make better pop chips. Dogs are welcome.“I overheard a lovely conversation the other week,” says Tracey Clusker, nurse manager for substance misuse at Midlothian health and social care partnership, and the driving force behind this ground-breaking approach to reaching some of Scotland’s most at-risk addicts.“Someone was struggling with diazepam use, then someone else shared: ‘This is how I’ve coped’. There’s a real concern for one another, how they manage their addiction day to day. People who have gone into rehab still come in, so they see that people are getting well and there’s always that hope that things can change.”While Tuesday’s shocking drug-related death figures, which put Scotland on a par with the US, have prompted calls for radical action, including decriminalisation, experts and frontline practitioners emphasise there is plenty to be done to save lives within the existing law.Clusker’s cafe-clinic is almost unique in a treatment landscape dominated by what many consider an outdated and rigid medical model. There’s an open-door policy here nobody is turned away, regardless of when they last used illegal drugs. And there’s a prescriber present, so if heroin users want to receive their opioid substitution treatment – usually methadone – here they can, with an initial prescription available within one week.But there are also peer support workers to talk to, access to housing and benefits advice, mental health referrals, physical health checks, and a chance to pick up clean needles or overdose-reversing naloxone kits.Clusker had the idea for this low-threshold drop-in clinic after clients told her about feeling judged in traditional healthcare settings, being discharged from treatment for missing appointments or failing urine tests, or being scared to attend if they were still using illegal drugs on top of their methadone.“It’s about engagement and connection, and that’s just as important as the methadone or buprenorphine prescription,” she says.With 15 years’ experience in the field, Clusker believes the key to keeping these people alive is to keep them in treatment, where they can receive a regular dose of a heroin substitute. This therapeutic dose must be high enough to sustain the inidual – experts point to a culture of low dosing in many NHS services, with the unintended and dangerous consequence of self-medication with other drugs.“This is really a clinic that’s treating trauma,” says Clusker. “What people are doing is using drugs as a solution to very difficult life experiences. I see a high proportion of looked-after children, or those affected by parental drug abuse, domestic violence, child sexual abuse. It’s also linked to poverty, austerity. There’s not many people at that clinic enjoying drug use. It’s not a choice.”“We have patients who, as they get older, are very ambivalent about whether they are living or not,” says John Budd, a GP at the Edinburgh Access Practice and another local pioneer, who runs an innovative drop-in service for a similar cohort of homeless patients in the city centre. “They are continually defeated by the welfare system, by healthcare. They can’t wait the three-month average time it takes to get on to treatment. We have to work very hard to establish relationships with this group.”Progress means meeting people on their terms, says Budd. He runs a regular pet clinic at the practice, which can give owners the opportunity to start a conversation about their own health needs, and offers outreach sessions at a nearby homeless crisis centre.But how do the lessons of one innovative practice apply to an entire system? It is partly a question of resources, says Budd: drug and alcohol services are still recovering from a significant funding cut made by the Scottish government two years ago. “But there is a culture change needed. We put too many barriers in people’s way, while practitioners can still be risk-averse or lack training.”The Scottish drug treatment system is “a black hole”, says Andrew McAuley, a senior research fellow at Glasgow Caledonian University. The highly respected health policy analyst, who has worked in the health service for 15 years, says: “The system is fragmented, under-resourced and is the same as it was 20 year ago, but people are using much more lethal poly-drug combinations now, with the rise of street benzos and injecting cocaine. They need the wraparound services because the cases are much more complex. But these are the things that get stripped out when funding becomes tight.”McAuley contrasts what he sees as the current “political inertia” with Scotland’s world-leading approach to take-home naloxone – the antidote to opioid overdose – which was implemented nationally in 2011 and cited as an example of best practice by the World Health Organization.Scotland’s public health minister, Joe Fitzpatrick, has committed to a public health approach to problem drug use in the wake of the latest fatality figures, having recently appointed a taskforce to consider international evidence around decriminalisation and drug consumption rooms, as well as investigating challenges around treatment services and stigma. But bereaved families want action.“All everybody does is speak about it, what needs to be done, what they would like to do if they had the powers,” says Anne McDermott, whose son Scott died of a drug overdose in Edinburgh last year at the age of 35.Scott was found to have six different drugs, including methadone, in his system when he died, and McDermott is perhaps understandably sceptical about the worth of substitution treatment alone.She wants to see more rehab places, support for those trying to manage on methadone at home, and better use of drug treatment orders – a potentially life-saving community sanction that a recent freedom of information request from the Scottish Liberal Democrats found was used only 37 times in response to 3,600 convictions for possession in 2017-18.McDermott believes that in big cities like Edinburgh, the public and the authorities have become inured to discarded needles, obviously intoxicated beggars and “just another junkie death”.“They don’t ask the addicts what they need. They don’t ask those that would sell their soul for a bag, whose children are in care because drugs mean more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7ec783f79c5ce91f50423a248ffda53a92ef368/0_244_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4829e974a78f881ef1068deca9dde04","title":"dina asher smith worlds best london anniversary games","story":"Three European gold medals raised expectations but the sprinter views Anniversary Games as a step on the way to bigger titlesAmid a flurry of fond reminiscence and surrounded by a plethora of yoghurt products, the stars of track and field have arrived in London for the Müller Anniversary Games.A two-day Diamond League event, the Anniversary Games were part of the legacy offering that followed the 2012 Olympics in London. For many of the athletes competing this year, however, the relevant anniversary is that of two years ago when the London Stadium hosted the World Athletics Championships. With the next worlds approaching in Doha in September, and the Olympics only a year away, the Anniversary Games are shaping up to be an intriguing staging post, with strong lineups in several of the 30 scheduled disciplines.One of the stars turning out in Stratford will be Dina Asher-Smith. Last year, the 23-year-old raised standards and expectations by bringing home three sprinting gold medals from the European Championships. This year’s challenge is a different one again.“I feel people’s expectations, but I don’t think I take it in a bad way. Some people get really overwhelmed but for me it’s nice to think that people believe I can go on to do great things. I’ve actually taken some of their energy and put it into myself as well. For years and years you haven’t seen this hype in some athletes and disciplines in the UK. For people to be getting excited about women’s sprints is I think really nice.”Racing in the UK for the first time this year, Asher-Smith is due to compete in the women’s 100m and Sunday’s 4x100m relay. This means she will not be competing in the 200m, the event in which she made her name, a strategic decision that shows the importance for athletes of maintaining and balancing their form at this crucial point in the competitive cycle.The women’s 100m features a strong field including the world and double Olympic champion, the Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price, whose 10.73sec last month is the joint-fastest time in the world this year. The Ivory Coast’s Murielle Ahouré, a former double world silver medallist, and Marie-Josée Ta Lou, who has run 10.93 this year, are also in competition and Asher-Smith – whose best this season is 10.91 – is excited by the challenge, even if the result is of secondary importance.“Doing well against Olympic champions and world champions will always be fantastic, but I never have the mentality of having to prove myself,” she said. “I just don’t go to places like that. I know that when the world championships arrive I will hopefully be in the right place. Everybody is at different stages with their preparation, it is a long season. Some people have been in fantastic shape since May, some have been peaking for this trial and then going back into training.Among the other big names competing at the London Stadium are Yohan Blake and Andre De Grasse in the men’s 100m. They will be joined by Britain’s James Ellington, making his first competitive appearance since a serious motorbike accident in 2017. Also racing are the outstanding men’s 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod, the new women’s mile world record holder Sifan Hassan, competing in the 5,000m, and Karsten Warholm, the world champion in the men’s 400m hurdles. Warholm was typical of the athletes who spoke before the event in sharing a real enthusiasm for the London Stadium. The running track is frequently a bone of contention for other sports using the venue, its broad dimensions even the subject of complaints during two baseball fixtures last month. But for track and field athletes it is a distinct attraction.“The track is very good, and the warm-up facilities are world-class,” said Warholm, who also admitted to having recently constructed a simulacrum of a London bus in Lego. “This is where it all started and all the memories I have are very good. I very much like it in London, that’s why I keep coming back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cc34195efe184e37f35052be4671cc0baa56f1/0_71_2913_1748/master/2913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a2766fa6b09ed4ee7870d593ad8d829","title":"england series defeat australia","story":"England have moved a step closer to certain defeat in the Ashes after the second day of the Taunton Test, in which rain wiped out the entire afternoon and evening sessions.Australia, fully aware that a draw in this match will see them retain the Ashes, were again content simply to bat out time, with Ellyse Perry spending seven overs in the “nervous 90s”before finally bringing up three figures.While Laura Marsh struck twice in quick succession before the lunch break to remove both Perry and Rachael Haynes, who fell 13 runs short of a maiden Test century, both wickets came too late to make much difference to a match which is, short of a miracle, heading gradually towards a draw.“From our point of view we’ve done what we can – we’ve bowled in good areas and put them under pressure,” Marsh said after play was finally called off for the day. “We can only do what’s in our control and we’ve done that brilliantly so far. Every time you get to represent your country it’s a huge honour and we will be looking to fight right to the end.”Nonetheless it was obvious from the way the England players sagged in the field as the morning session drew on that in their heart of hearts they already know the Ashes are lost.The postmortems will begin soon enough. Casual observers might question whether Heather Knight’s captaincy should come under fire - as Charlotte Edwards’ did four years ago – or whether the coach, Mark Robinson, might equally face calls to resign. England’s last Women’s Ashes defeat at home saw off his predecessor, Paul Shaw. This time, though, such calls would seem to miss the crucial point: Australia have simply proved too good for their opponents.England have thrown everything at this series. They were inches away from getting over the line in the first ODI at Leicester in the second Tammy Beaumont’s century could easily have been a match-defining innings. Both days of this Test their bowlers have toiled hard but have been unable to make a significant dent in an Australian batting line-up that is the envy of the world. England were unlucky to lose the toss: but the real problem throughout has been that they are having to do all the running, while Australia were, perhaps inevitably, quite content to bat first and then grind out runs for the first two days.What the past three weeks have done is to expose the gap which now exists between the two sides. Of Australia’s top six only Nicole Bolton can be said to have failed to make an impact with the bat: they have a strength in depth which England cannot rival. In the first two ODIs it was this lineup which held their nerve in two difficult run chases: the contrast with England’s showing at Canterbury was marked.The last time these sides met in a bilateral series Australia may have retained the trophy but the 8-8 scoreline reflected the fact that the contest was at least even. In the two years since, though, Australia have been enjoying the fruits of a historic pay deal agreed in August 2017, which created the only fully professional women’s domestic set-up anywhere in the world. What of England? This squad of players is almost identical to that which triumphed in the World Cup two summers ago, and it has grown stronger since then, a period in which Amy Jones has finally begun to fulfil her potential and Danni Wyatt has become one of the most threatening T20 batsmen in the world.The crucial difference is that, while the Australian structure now oozes professionalism at every level, the English system is top-heavy: beneath the contracted 21 England players is a domestic set-up which remains entirely amateur. Players coming straight out of county cricket into the England set-up, as with Test debutant Kirstie Gordon, often struggle to make the step up, with the difference in fielding standards especially apparent. County cricketers might very well go through the off-season with no access to coaching whatsoever and even during the season will be working with coaches who are part-time at best.The England squad might be criticised for living in a “bubble” at Loughborough but what other choice do they have? “You need a base, you need a hub, you need somewhere you can call home,” Jonathan Finch, the ECB’s women and girls’ high performance manager, said on TMS in the lunch break. “If you don’t have that, it’s very difficult to develop your players and move them forwards.” Unfortunately inter-squad matches at Loughborough are poor dress rehearsals for high-pressure international match situations. England really lost this series because of a disastrous batting collapse at Canterbury: until they have a domestic competition which can rival the Australian state competition, the Women’s National Cricket League, they will continue to crumble in those moments.Prior to this series the high-ups at the ECB had already promised a shake-up of domestic women’s cricket: as yet, the details remain sketchy. Perhaps a looming Ashes defeat will be enough to focus their minds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a6c586c4248b380e27e3f6a6eb519f20caab5f/0_185_5298_3178/master/5298.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf68f6a3d5e02147b3fa84ac34df51c","title":"masters win tiger woods rumble in jungle","story":"• Three-times champion candid after finishing on six over• ‘I don’t have the flexibility I used to have, and never will’Tiger Woods looked to be moving into Muhammad Ali territory this summer. He was not Ali in his pomp but the 1974 Rumble-in-the-Jungle Ali, the magician who shook up the world again at 32, convincing millions that destroying George Foreman proved to everyone there was more to come.Was Tiger’s Augusta triumph in April his Kinshasa? Or would there be a Joe Frazier waiting to make him suffer in Portrush this week? Joe was the wind and the rain and one of the best links courses in the world. An underdone Woods, knocked out in the second round, six over, was in no shape to tame his nemesis.On a morning milder than the on-off wet chill of Thursday, Woods was 12 shots behind the overnight leader, JB Holmes, and, at seven over, five or so shots beyond the estimated cut. As with his career, the clock was ticking louder and faster than before. Five hours later, he was 14 behind Holmes and going home.Woods was characteristically tough on himself, and candid. “I had a chance to get it back to even par for the tournament. I didn’t handle the par-fives well. I was in perfect condition all three of them. If I handled those par-fives, well, I would be right there. Let’s be honest, I don’t have the flexibility I used to have, and never will. So I’m going to have to make those adaptations.”For Woods, golf has become a dual calibration: of what he can do with a golf ball, and what he can ask his body to endure. The former is technical and he was able to harness his revamped swing at Augusta. However, although the tailor probably needed no more than minor tweaks to fit his green jacket, there would forever be vulnerability in his broad back and his unreliable knees.Before departing Portrush, he said: “One of the hardest things to accept as an older athlete is that you’re not going to be as consistent as you were at 23. I’m going to have my hot weeks. I’m going to be in contention, and I will win tournaments. But there are times when I’m just not going to be there. That wasn’t the case 20-some years ago. I had a different body.”So, maybe Woods was not so much Ali – who could find the self-destruct button in the dark and punched his way into a palsied abyss – but the more measured Roger Federer. The Swiss, 38 next month, has husbanded his resources like a war-time sugar thief. He plays when he has to, and no more. “When you start playing just for the money,” he said last year, “it’s time to wonder.”Woods, one of the first billionaire athletes, is not playing “just for the money”. He is playing to keep the last embers of his fire going. Like Federer, he loves his sport to distraction. Like Federer, he hates to lose. And like Federer at Wimbledon last Sunday, he has learned to cope with disappointment.Yet mortals always demand miracles from their heroes. Golf fans wanted the old Tiger back. He won his fifth Masters at 43, after all, the 15th major of his career. “Why not?” they ask. Jack won it in ‘86 at 46, his 18th and last major.Other numbers told a different story. Between 1998 and 2005 Woods made a record 142 cuts in a row, one of the most astonishing records in the history of the game Byron Nelson’s 113 and Nicklaus’s 105 are way in the distance, next best. But three of Woods’s missed cuts in majors have come at the Open – in 2009, 2015 and here.There were flickers of greatness before he left. He looked every inch a champion in a white top and black trousers – then shoved his first tee-shot into the semi-rough. The lie was decent. The approach was better. The putt, curving like a longbow over about 25 feet, was magnificent, dropping gently into the hole for a birdie. The place went crazy.Woods was not trying to win the tournament. He was battling to stay in it. Early in his round, the breeze could do no more than tug at his thinning curls. In the space of 20 minutes, he had a Kinshasa moment: back-to-back birdies for four over, three outside the cut with seven holes left. Tiger had rope-a-doped the event, had he? He needed a spectacular finish.Five holes left, four shots to make up. The temperature dropped, the wind got up and it rained again. In his weather-proof jacket, Woods thrashed out of fairway rubbish on 17, livid with the result and a bogey five buried him.On the 18th, a tired approach shot left him way short and he made bogey again. As he made the long, forlorn walk to the clubhouse, the faithful applauded him generously, which he surely appreciated.As would David Duval, four years older than Tiger, and his only real rival 20 years ago. On day one, the 2001 champion shot 91, confirming the bookies’ pre-tournament judgment that he was the worst player in the field, a 1-7 favourite to miss the cut. On Friday Duval shot 78 (including two birdies) and left town with 169, 27 over par and dead last.At least he was not as bad as the unfortunately monikered Guy McQuitty, from Exeter, who didn’t quit but could have, at Turnberry in 1986, when he staggered away 42 over par after two days, leaving 182 shots on a course that withstood 45mph winds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6535456b6c1bf35cd67c67e24c6207937c7f1fb4/0_147_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e0d923b768038732ee33e91b08ce17","title":"rory mcilroy best not good enough","story":"A most bittersweet moment this and, when it was over, Rory McIlroy almost seemed unsure whether it had been a victory or defeat. He followed one of the very worst rounds of his career, the error-strewn 79 he shot on day one, with one of the very best, a 65 studded with six birdies, rich with brilliant drives, chips and putts. Add them both together and he had a total of 144, two over par, and one sorry shot away from making the cut and playing the weekend. It was, he said, “one of the most fun rounds of golf” he had ever played and it left him he feeling a weird mix of disappointment, pride and gratitude.He was not the only one. Almost every last man, woman and child on the course watching him felt similar things. They roared McIlroy around and by the time he reached the back nine they were sprinting on ahead of him and his ball, hundreds of them running pell-mell from one hole to the next to try and get themselves a better view of whatever it was he was about to do. He rewarded them with three back-to-back birdies on the 10th, 11th and 12th and then made them suffer a bogey on the par-three 13th where, full of adrenaline, he dropped his tee-shot in a pot bunker.That made them cheer only louder. McIlroy pulled it back right away at the 14th with a 15ft birdie putt but missed another opportunity at the next, where, having smashed a drive out so far that his second shot was only 89 yards shy, he managed to pick out a greenside bunker. He still scrambled away with a par.The equation, then, was that he needed to make two birdies on the last three holes. He got one of them right away at the tricky par-three 16th. That was the hard part. But he then blew the easy bit at the straightforward 17th, where he lashed his drive wide right and had to scramble up and down.So he came to the 18th tee with everything hanging on whether he could make a birdie on Royal Portrush’s last, and hardest, hole. His drive left him every chance. It landed in the middle of the fairway, 200 yards shy. And then he hit the shot that finished it. The ball faded left, rolled into a swale on the short side of the hole. He needed something miraculous now. The crowd, packed tight in the great horseshoe grandstand that surrounds the green, believed in him but he knew it was going to be an impossible shot. He pulled off his cap and waved it to them as he walked on to the green and it seemed to be in farewell as much as thanks.It must have been the greatest reception ever given to a man chasing a share of 70th place. “It’s a moment I envisaged for the last few years,” McIlroy said after he had putted out that last par. “It just happened two days early.” He was overcome by it all, as if he had only just realised how much he meant to them and they to him. “To see everyone out there sort of cheering on one cause, cheering for the same thing, was pretty special. And that thing was me, fortunately,” he said. “As much as I came here at the start of the week saying I wanted to do it for me, you know, by the end of the round there today I was doing it just as much for them.”McIlroy will regret the mistakes he made on the first day, when his play had been so tense and nervous, the wild drive on the 1st tee, the three-putt from close range on the 16th, the hack from the rough on the 18th. “It’s going to be a tough one to get over,” he said, “I’ll probably rue the finish yesterday, dropping five shots on the last three holes.” Right now, in public at least, he is still insisting it was “a blip”, that it was “just one of those things”. It was not and he and his team will have to come with a better, and more honest, answer than that if he is ever going to figure out and fix what went wrong.Because the truth is that McIlroy played one of the very worst rounds of his life when it mattered most, on a course he, and his caddie, know as well as any in the world, a course where he then played, the very next day, some of his very finest golf, in a tournament he has been preparing for over the last two years.McIlroy’s flaws make him easy to love but, if he is going to win more than the four majors he has, to win as many as his absurd natural talents deserve, he is going to have to figure out how to overcome them. “There’s always next week,” he said, “I’ve got a pretty big tournament in Memphis.” As if history was going to remember how he gets on in the WGC-FedEx St Jude Invitational. “Even though the major season is over for me, there’s still a lot to play for.” He did not sound convinced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c571861815b1bf35fa0cc033d9b7f4fddc95cc5e/128_733_4244_2547/master/4244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12aad10c7723f9b9d2bafa9224428278","title":"rory mcilroy shane lowry the open jb holmes","story":"• McIlroy misses the cut by one shot after brilliant round of 65• JB Holmes and Lowry head halfway field on eight underAmid spine-tingling scenes, which began on Royal Portrush’s 1st tee and concluded with a standing ovation as Rory McIlroy waved goodbye in failing light, a global superstar reconnected with his own people. McIlroy fought hard, and just about succeeded, to control his emotions.McIlroy fell short – only just – in his attempt to reach the weekend of the 148th Open Championship but the swell of support afforded to him felt like a victory in itself. Had McIlroy been in pursuit of the Claret Jug here Sundayevening, the spectacle would have broken sporting boundaries.Bare statistics will show McIlroy’s two-over-par aggregate was one short of cut salvation. Commentators may point towards a birdie putt at the 17th which slid agonisingly past or an iron into the closing hole which bounded left of the green as crucial. In reality a string of events during an utterly freakish McIlroy Thursday curtailed his Open involvement.Those grasping for deep, psychological or technical reasoning for McIlroy’s 79 to begin this major are trying too hard. Such an outcome has not been a common trend for the 30-year-old, especially this year. Extraordinary days happen especially on links venues. When McIlroy pointed towards a “blip” or “anomaly” there was logic in his argument. His second round of 65 that thrilled the Portrush galleries was a joy to watch. This is the Rory Northern Ireland turned out to see.“The last week has been an eye-opener for me,” McIlroy said. “Sometimes you’re so far away and you forget about all the people that are cheering you on back home. Then you come and play in front of them. It definitely hit me like a ton of bricks today.“I didn’t know how people were going to react after yesterday, how many people were going to be on the 1st tee. Is it just a lost cause. But to have that many people out there following me, supporting me, cheer-ing my name, it meant the world to me.”Tiger Woods had earlier, much earlier, confirmed his own Portrush departure – comfortably so at six over. This marks the first time Woods and his old adversary Phil Mickelson have missed the cut in the same major – at the 83rd attempt. Adam Scott and Ian Poulter joined the high-profile exodus from the Antrim coast. Through that, of course, comes opportunity for others.At the business end of proceedings on what is a tantalisingly tight leaderboard, JB Holmes and Shane Lowry enter day three with a share of the lead at eight under. Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood trail that pair by a shot. Cameron Smith, Justin Harding and Justin Rose are tied at minus six.The placing of Brooks Koepka and Jordan Spieth among those at five under adds further gloss to the scene. Dylan Frittelli, once a college team-mate of Spieth, was tied at the top before a double bogey, bogey finish. Andrew Putnam completes the five under contingent.In what is not typically a tribal environment the scale of crowd support for Lowry’s major bid has been striking. The man from Offaly has recognised that all right. “It was incredible right from the 1st hole,” said Lowry after his second successive 67. “The crowd didn’t seem that big around the 3rd green but the roar when I holed my putt was unbelievable.“You can’t but smile, you can’t but laugh. There’s no point trying to shy away from it. It’s an incredible feeling getting applauded on every green, every tee box.”Lowry had reached 10 under before dropped shots at the 14th and 18th. He was honest enough to admit he “duffed” an approach shot to the latter. On the penultimate hole he bravely saved par after being distracted by commentary noise from a nearby big screen when on his tee shot backswing.Fleetwood added a 67 to Thursday’s 68 in reminding onlookers that major glory is in his sights. Fleetwood has flown under the radar for much of 2019, by his own admission because of some inconsistent form. Now back in the spotlight, Fleetwood will not mask his ambitions.“It’s your chance of putting your name in the history of the game,” said Fleetwood. “All of us dream of having majors in our career and taking those opportunities.“I think the other side of that is, you don’t know how many times you’re going to actually get the chance to compete at the back end of a draw on Saturday or Sunday in a major and it’s important to embrace it and enjoy it whatever happens. You don’t know what’s going to happen next week or the week after. You have to realise what a lucky position you’re in and how well you’ve done to get there.“I’m not going to tee off tomorrow and say: ‘I’m going to love this whatever happens.’ I want to make it happen. I want to win a major.”Westwood’s 68-67 start is identical to that of Fleetwood. At three under par after a level-par 71 Henrik Stenson is still very much part of this Open equation. So, too, is Dustin Johnson at the same score.It was impossible not to feel sympathy for Darren Clarke. The 2011 champion, so instrumental to the Open’s return to this venue after a 68-year absence, was firmly in position to make the cut when taking to the 18th tee at level par. Disaster beckoned Clarke ran up a triple bogey. It did not look a good idea to get in his way thereafter. Cruel characters, the golfing gods McIlroy will vouch for that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fa2bdd305f00654976bc5013433cd1b9cc7b82b/192_197_2906_1744/master/2906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7739abceba5ac26069f2fc35c51221b8","title":"ventura spirit newbury super sprint televised race tips","story":"It is hard to see past the Richard Fahey runner after the colt’s excellent run in the Norfolk Stakes at Royal AscotIn most years the Weatherbys Super Sprint at Newbury is a tremendously competitive contest among two-year-olds of broadly similar ability, posing a real trap for punters. But every so often it falls to a horse who is plainly a class above most of the field, as when Tiggy Wiggy and Monsieur Chevalier won, and Ventura Rebel (3.40) may add his name to that short list.From the Richard Fahey stable that has won this three times in six years, he beat a Wesley Ward-trained odds-on shot at Ascot in May. He was then beaten a neck in the Norfolk Stakes, from which the fourth has since won at Listed level. It is hard to see past him.1.50 Newbury This should be straightforward for the well-bred Fox Chairman, returning to the scene of his maiden success. He has since been placed in the Dee Stakes and the Hampton Court and has more to give.2.10 Market Rasen Having been rated 93 on the Flat, in which sphere he tackled Listed company several times, St Gallen was a classy recruit to jump racing. He is unbeaten in two since joining Olly Murphy from Ireland and travelled so comfortably at Kelso last time that he might have quite a bit in hand.2.25 Newbury With Mick Channon back among the winners, a chance is taken on Billy Ray. He has come back down to his last winning mark and ran well when fifth in a hot Newmarket race early last month.2.40 Newmarket It has been more than a decade since John Gosden won the Aphrodite Stakes but Sparkle Roll can take his tally to seven in the Listed contest for fillies. A half-sister to the 40-1 Derby winner Wings Of Eagles, she improved for the step up to this distance when third in the Ribblesdale and this looks like easier pickings.3.00 Newbury It seemed The Tin Man was not quite good enough for a top-class race at Royal Ascot last month but then that was also true in 2016, when he beat just one rival at Ascot before landing this contest. He can go in again in this Group Three, with the rain helpfully taking the edge off the need for raw speed.3.20 Market Rasen The Summer Plate looks as competitive as ever, though there is at least one issue facing each of the fancied runners. Casablanca Mix is still young enough to make good on the early promise she showed as a steeplechaser, which was somewhat derailed by a fall she took at Exeter in 2017. She got her first win since then at Aintree last time and can build on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5984aff9ed7ba21a831f04e1dde1d9d9092dbfd1/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6ded1fdd1e4c2219cfc9a0f75ee875","title":"sri lanka bombings three months on tourism workers tell their stories","story":"The Easter attacks hit the tourist trade hard. We talk to five Sri Lankans, whose livelihoods depend on visitors, about hardship, recovery and hopeMay and June are the low season in Sri Lanka, but this year, following the Easter Sunday bombings, tourism ground to a halt. Hotels were empty, beaches were deserted and popular attractions that had been starting to suffer from overtourism were eerily quiet. The UK Foreign Office’s warning against all but essential travel was issued on April 25, effectively forcing UK holidaymakers to either cancel or postpone bookings.“We had four yoga groups in May and June – they all had to cancel,” says Kevin Abbott, owner of Jim’s Farm Villas in central Sri Lanka. “We effectively closed the hotel. Last weekend we had our first guests since the attack.”In some ways people employed by hotels have been more fortunate than many other Sri Lankans who rely on tourism for their livelihoods. Most luxury hotels kept their staff on, albeit on lower wages. “Instead of laying associates off, we decided to speak to all of them immediately after the attack, and instructed all the managers to focus on training and developing their skills in order to prepare for the regular flow of tourists in time to come,” says Hashan Cooray, marketing director of Jetwing Hotels.But thousands tuktuk drivers, guides, souvenir and food sellers who are dependent on tourist spending saw their income disappear overnight.Now, says Sennema, bookings are “improving much faster than expected” and the company has been able to give drivers an interest-free loan to get their vehicles back. This week in London, the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, a group of over 160 hoteliers and tour operators, launched a campaign to revive tourism to the country. So far much of the publicity has focused on deals and the fact that tourists will have some of the country’s biggest sights to themselves. But, for Sam Clark, founder of Experience Travel Group and a co-founder of the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, the greatest benefit to travellers going now is the knowledge that their trip will have a direct and significant impact on local lives.“By returning to Sri Lanka and experiencing the country, it is ordinary Sri Lankans that you are helping most: your spending money goes much further, much faster than you might imagine. Just your presence in the country is taken as an endorsement of their efforts to recover,” says Clark.Our local writer spoke to five Sri Lankans about their experience in the past three months and their hopes for the coming months.Isabel ChoatAnjula has worked as a freelance chauffeur-guide for the last seven years. It can be a good career: in the past, during the high season from Christmas to April, he would take home 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees a month (£1,370-£1,600). Most chauffeur-guides maintain their own vehicles, though many have staggeringly high monthly loans to repay, meaning they have to work a set number of days just to break even. For Anjula, this equates to £92 a month: manageable when work is good, as it has been for the last few years, but a problem when work dries up. Other drivers are dogged by much bigger loans, someover £460 a month, showing a blind determination to succeed in an industry that has grown exponentially over the last decade, since the end of the 26-year civil war in 2009.Anjula usually prepares for the quieter season (May to October) by keeping money aside to tide him over, but with no idea when bookings will pick up again, he has decided to sell his car.“I’m considering going to work in Dubai for a year or two, until tourism picks up again here,” he says. “I got married last year and we’ve decided to wait until things are settled before having children.” It’s a common theme, and local travel companies reliant on their drivers are keen to keep them. A knowledgable and amiable chauffeur-guide can help make a holiday. .Despite everything, Anjula considers himself lucky. He lives less than a mile from St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo, where he usually attends mass – and where more than 100 people died in the worst of the Easter Sunday terror attacks. He overslept that morning. Had he not, he and his wife would probably have been among the casualties.For those passionate about wildlife, Sri Lanka is a place of great ersity, where leopard, sloth bears and elephants reside within 22 protected national parks. The attraction of higher-than-average earnings has lured some into safari-guiding, despite not having – nor, incredibly, needing – any formal wildlife training. But some parks are now oversubscribed, and the recent loss of business has left many in the industry reeling.Jeep driver Ruwan lives near Udawalawe national park, a southern reserve with a vast reservoir backed by the mist-laden mountains of the Hill Country. Elephants are part of life here: for some this is a blessing, as this is one of the best places in Sri Lanka to see them in the wild for others they are pests that stray into farmland and destroy or consume crops.More than 400 jeeps are registered with the park, so it helps that Ruwan has been the go-to driver for new safari lodge Camp Hasthi, which opened last year. He also helps in the camp, which has four permanent tents with attached toilets and solar power, plus gardens of vegetables and mangos. Community-orientated, the camp’s owners employ local villagers like Ruwan and source fish and fresh produce from local suppliers. As the sole breadwinner in the family –supporting his wife, three-month-old son, parents and mother-in-law – Ruwan was earning a “comfortable” average of £185 a month doing a job he loved.After the attacks, Ruwan started working as a labourer to make ends meet, and eventually, with Camp Hasthi’s help, purchased a plough. He was also fortunate to have his father’s four-acres of land to fall back on. Having neglected it in favour of jeep driving, it’s now newly ploughed and seeded, and he hopes it will earn a profit when it’s harvested next year. Ruwan has learned a valuable lesson, too, and vows to keep it going even when the tourists return.With Colombo the focus of the Easter attacks, stays in the capital were quickly scrapped from visitors’ itineraries. Parks and promenades, shopping centres and dining quarters fell silent in the weeks following. Colombo resident Mark Forbes (a Dutch Burgher), founder of Colombo City Walks, received many cancellations.He was also unable to honour the walk requests that did come in since access to the colonial-era Fort, focus of his most popular walks, was in an out-of-bounds high-security zone. Another of his key neighbourhoods, the Pettah, a multi-ethnic maze of streets selling wholesale items such as electronics and haberdashery to the entire country, had also fallen quiet.Security in Colombo has often been tight as a result of the civil war, however its renaissance since hostilities ceased has been astounding. Health-food cafes, rooftop bars, jogging tracks, restaurant districts, contemporary art galleries and high-rise condos and shopping centres have transformed it into a modern city.Visitors combine Mark’s three-hour morning or afternoon walks with shopping in Barefoot or Paradise Road, and a meal in the Ministry of Crab, a restaurant within the sensitively renovated Old Dutch Hospital in Fort. Offering twice-daily walks, including hosting groups from passing cruise ships, Mark’s team has grown to four.Since the beginning of July, Mark has noticed a dramatic increase in enquiries compared with May and June. Security is less tight around Fort and cordoned-off areas have reopened. Footfall is increasing in public areas and vendors working in the Pettah have mostly returned. Mark is feeling positive that resilient Colombo will soon return to form.For 30 years Ratnasiri has been strolling the curve of Unawatuna beach, not far from the former Dutch colonial city of Galle, on the south-west coast, selling souvenirs to tourists from a black holdall. With his hands clutching a hand-hewn elephant, a stilt fishermen and a cascade of garishly painted key tag masks – all common souvenirs – he tells me some of his most successful days as a vendor were during the civil war, when souvenir shops – which now line the road uninterrupted into Unawatuna – were few and far between.Ratnasiri used to carve many items by hand but now just makes the key tags and buys the rest from wholesalers.Ratnasiri lives with his wife in Galle, though he didn’t bother making the 15km round-trip to Unawatuna in the eight weeks following the attacks, as the beach was deserted. During the high-season, Ratnasiri might take home £12 to £14 a day, though the fall in visitor numbers means he’s earned very little in the past few months, and things are uncertain this year. Yet Ratnasiri remains upbeat.He tells me he survived the after-effects of the 2004 tsunami and has noticed more tourists in recent weeks. “It’s peaceful, isn’t it?” he asks, rhetorically, as his eyes dart around the formerly heaving beach seeking out the handful of potential customers wading in and out of an ocean that’s calm and vibrantly blue.At home in Sri Lanka’s hills, nature reserves and most-untouched regions, Sidantha (Sid) has been working in the tourist industry for more than 15 years. Finding the corporate world a bad fit for his adventurous spirit, Sid found refuge in Walpolamulla, a tiny hamlet only accessible on foot, deep within the Knuckles, a vast mountainous forest conservation area to the north-east of Kandy. Taken in by his “non-biological grandparents”, he found the solace and simplicity of life in this cut-off region so inspiring that when elephants finally forced them from their home, and down into the nearest village, he revived it as a homestay for his small eco-tourism, profit-sharing venture, Abode Tours.Unlike most village experiences in Sri Lanka, residents here live a self-sustaining life, devoid of TVs, 4G and wifi, and unaffected by outside events – so much so that tourism revenue is supplementary, rather than integral to their income. So as not to upset the balance of local life, Sid sends just a small number of “travel-hardened” guests there a year, combining the visits with other less-visited areas, such as Gal Oya national park and north-westerly Mannar, where Sid has another homestay, Hibernate, looked after by a Tamil-Hindu family in the fishing and toddy-tapping (palm wine) trades.While his beneficiaries aren’t reliant on tourism, Sid has had to contend with cancellations since the Easter attacks. He’s had to put off or cancel projects as there’s not much “in the kitty” to do the usual upgrades and repairs, though he worries about the suppliers he’s let down. Keen to focus his energies on Abode and Hibernate, he remains dedicated to promoting sustainable tourism in Sri Lanka. Just three weeks ago he received a big boost – a booking for 14 people – and feels things are looking up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/284725bf2831fdeb72d6e33f1c192240da0b72ef/0_367_5862_3517/master/5862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=998939769c496c62c9d467828c627d4e","title":"bear wood project brings lost species back to uks ancient forests","story":"Project to recreate ancient habitat prepares for delicate process of reuniting species On a summer’s day the spot is idyllic. Ancient English woodland tumbles towards the broad river valley. The birds sing, the squirrels scurry.Then suddenly the mood changes as a bear ambles mightily into sight among the oak trees. Another clambers up a towering ash and seems to take in the view down to the River Severn and and across towards the Forest of Dean.Soon these Eurasian brown bears will be joined by a pack of Eurasian grey wolves and the two species will coexist – hopefully peacefully – in this corner of northern Europe for the first time in more than 1,000 years.This is not an ambitious rewilding scheme but a project run by the Bristol Zoological Society to offer a glimpse into what ancient British woodland was like before humans cleared the forests to make room for homes and farms and exterminated some of the spectacular creatures that lived there.The sight of bears and wolves together in one large enclosure will thrill visitors to Bear Wood within Bristol zoo’s Wild Place project but it is also designed to be thought-provoking – why did our ancestors think it acceptable to wipe out the bear and wolf and could we live with them again in the future?Dr Christoph Schwitzer, the chief zoological officer, is pleased that even before next week’s public opening, Bear Wood is provoking such debate. The zoo is proud of its conservation projects that range from trying to bolster gorilla populations in central Africa to reintroducing white-clawed crayfish to the UK.Schwitzer believes there is also a good argument for reintroducing larger creatures such as lynx to remote areas such as the Scottish highlands. “That may be worth trying. A population of 300 or 400 lynx might be viable,” he said.But bears and wolves in England? “That’s a lot more tricky. There are a lot of factors you need to consider, the first being that we are a heavily populated country.” And human behaviour has not changed over the centuries. “People would still go out and kill them,” he said.The opinion is not just theoretical. When a bear nicknamed Bruno wandered into German in 2006 he lasted only seven weeks before being shot by hunters. “People were so scared of it they couldn’t live with it,” said Schwitzer.All of which makes Bear Wood a bittersweet sort of place.As well as wolves and bears, wolverines and lynx are to be found in Bear Wood. They are in separate enclosures so will not come face to face with the larger animals, though they will smell and hear them.The wolverine is a member of the mustelid family that includes badgers, weasels and otters. It too once roamed British woodland before disappearing, presumably hunted for its fur and meat. A handful of wolverine bones have been found in Britain, more than half of them in south-west England and south Wales.Lynx vanished after the wolverine as woodland was chopped down, and next it was the turn of the bear to disappear. Quite when native British bears became extinct is not known. Bears were a familiar sight in Roman and medieval times but they may have been imported.Introducing the bears and wolves to each other will be a delicate process. “You have to observe rules,” said Schwitzer. “You can’t just throw them in together.”At first the five wolves will be brought into a separate enclosure next to the large one where the four bears are currently roaming so the two species can get used to one another.When the keepers judge the time is right the wolves will be allowed into the joint enclosure, though they will be able to retreat without the bears following them if they feel the need.“Conflict arises around prey or offspring,” said Schwitzer. So they will feed separately. The three male bears are to be castrated and the five wolves are all males so there will be no breeding and so no young to fight over.The fact that the bears and wolves have a 10,000 sq metre wooded paddock to share should help. They can keep away from each other if they want and interact if the mood takes them.Scientists will also be interested to find out what impact they have on the woodland. “We’ll be able to see how they change the flora and fauna,” said Schwitzer. The squirrels are likely to flee and the bears may clear vegetation, allowing more light-loving plants into the woods. Different invertebrates may move in.It will also be interesting to see how the bears and wolves operate as summer gives way to autumn and winter. It is not clear whether the bears will dig themselves into a den and hibernate.Across the Severn wild boar live wild in the Forest of Dean after accidental and deliberate releases from farms, and a year ago beavers were released into a large pen in the forest as part of a project to alleviate flooding. Wild beavers have also returned to a river in Devon. They are unlikely to be joined any time soon by bears or wolves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd79ed6e0bba97ebb79ce836e59019567e6dd3e4/0_409_4373_2624/master/4373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ce7ad2545a91f68dc49da5e8d7e16fe","title":"eiderdown harvesting iceland eider duck","story":"In Iceland, the harvesting of these precious feathers has created a peculiar bond between human and duck. What can this unique relationship teach us? It is difficult to describe the weight of eiderdown in a language in which the epitome of lightness is a feather. Unlike a feather’s ordered barbs arranged around a solid shaft, under a microscope, eiderdown offers a portrait of chaos: hundreds of soft threads branch out from a single point, twisting around one another. Upon each thread are countless small hooks, which allow the down to cling to itself, trapping pockets of air and warmth.When I returned from Iceland, I asked my wife to close her eyes and put her hands out. After placing a duck-size clump of down in her hands, I asked her what she felt. “Heat,” she said. She opened her eyes to find the down, a ghostly grey form, hovering above her palms, and pulled it apart. It crackled as if electrified, emitting a mild smell that reminded me of burned hair. She scrunched her hands and the down disappeared in her fingers, compressed into a ball smaller than a duckling’s bill.Over centuries, eiderdown has been treasured by those who shared their lands with the eider. The Vikings apparently filled their bedding with it, while medieval tax collectors accepted it as a means of payment. Today, its buyers are the global super-rich. In Iceland, I heard stories about Gulf royals who sleep under eiderdown in the desert, and Russian politicians whose hearts can be warmed with the gift of an eiderdown duvet.The properties of eiderdown – extreme lightness and insulation – make sense when you consider the life of its owner. The eider is a fat seabird, more penguin than duck, and many of them spend most of their lives in the Arctic Circle. Visit the Icelandic coast and you will see hundreds bobbing gregariously in the sea. Brash creatures, their boldness inspires admiration in the Icelanders. “The eider is an unsung hero, far braver than any bird of prey, which it is known to attack to protect its offspring,” one local told me.The usual story of how feathers come to fill our bedding is anything but comforting. According to trade bodies, most feathers are a byproduct of the meat industry. Less fortunate birds may have their plumage ripped out while they are still alive, a practice known as live-plucking.As I held a clump of eiderdown in my hand, however, one Icelander told me something that seemed to offer an alternative to this unsettling relationship between humans and birds. He said that the eider it once belonged to is probably still alive. Not in some dark barn, or even in an open-air enclosure, but in the wilds of the Arctic Circle.In a cafe in Ísafjörður, the pastor explained how he harvests eiderdown. As part of his parish duties, he runs a small farm, a throwback to earlier times when pastors in remote areas would survive off the land. Every June, he said, about 500 ducks arrive from the sea and waddle to his farm. Eiders do not naturally nest in such large colonies, but will congregate close to human settlements to seek shelter and protection. The ducks nest anywhere: in tyres, doorways and even houses. “I always take a lot of flags with me and I put a flag beside each nest so I will be able to find it again. Because they are incredibly camouflaged, these ducks. You can almost step on them,” he said.At night, the pastor guards the flock of eiders from their predators: seagulls, foxes and mink. “I was quite lucky in that I got interested in guns when I was just a little over 20,” he said. “It was before I started studying theology.” If he were to fall asleep, a fox would have a feast of sitting ducks. “It’s more than a financial loss, it’s also like they are depending on me. So I don’t want to let them down. I used to be a night watchman, so I have a little bit of experience staying awake.”In the middle ages, pelicans were thought to pierce their own breast to draw blood to feed their young. The mythical act was known as vulning, a Christ-like act of self-sacrifice. On the pastor’s land, the eider, too, makes herself vulnerable for her offspring, although it is down, not blood, that she draws from her breast. From this down she builds a nest for her eggs her own bare skin, freshly revealed, covers them with warmth. She sits on her eggs for some 28 days, during which she may lose a third of her body weight some mothers starve to death.The scene described by the pastor has been a common sight in Iceland for centuries. Down has been collected here probably since the arrival of Norse settlers in the ninth century. The sight of thousands of tame eiders close to human settlements astounded early European travellers in Iceland. CW Shepherd, an Englishman who visited the island of Vigur in the Westfjords in 1862, described a farm besieged by eiders: “On the ground, the house was fringed with ducks. On the turf slopes of the roof, we could see ducks and a duck sat on the door-scraper … A windmill was infested and so were all the outhouses, mounds, rocks and crevices. The ducks were everywhere.”Environmentalists, economists and ornithologists have all fallen in love with Icelandic harvesting. There is an irresistible simplicity to the relationship between the harvesters and the eiders. If a harvester cares for the ducks, more and more will come to nest, increasing the amount of down that can be gathered.In myths, fables and hagiographies, one often reads of the ability of iniduals to tame wild creatures. It is said that St Cuthbert, the seventh-century missionary who settled on the Farne Islands off the Northumbrian coast, protected and tamed eiders. (Today in Northumberland, the eider is sometimes called St Cuthbert’s or Cuddy duck.) Many of these stories were built upon embellishment or pure fantasy, but in Iceland, travellers’ accounts repeatedly confirmed the existence of this strange relationship between Icelanders and the ducks.I wanted to know how this relationship worked, how it was possible for a wild bird to behave as if it were domesticated. How did this strange tradition come about? How was it that the relationship had been preserved despite the arrival of the market? Could eiderdown harvesting teach us about our relationship with other species?Back in Ísafjörður, the pastor told me about a Japanese film crew who had made a documentary about him. For several weeks, they followed him around his farm, recording him collecting down with his children, while sidestepping nesting eiders. He appeared bemused by their attention, just as he was by mine. After all, he said, the down was only some brauð, a slice of his daily bread.The pastor’s parish lay a short drive from Ísafjörður in another fjord, Önundarfjörður. It was once reached via a winding mountain road but, since 1996, the two fjords have been connected by a vast tunnel that bores directly through the hillside. One morning, I emerged from its confines, blinded by the subarctic light, and headed to the pastor’s church to take a tour of his nesting area.Like many Lutheran parishes, the pastor’s land is among the most prized in the Westfjords. In the shadow of a steep glacial wall, his family home and church overlook a floodplain that leads to the shoreline. It was hard to conceive of a more peaceful spot for a family, yet there was an air of abandonment to the pastor’s home. Children’s toys lay scattered around on the floor and a layer of dust covered the work surfaces. The previous winter, he explained, the weather had got so bad that he and his family had to leave the parish and take an apartment in Ísafjörður. He now rarely spends any time in the house. “We were trapped here for 36 hours with no electricity, no phone,” he said. “I can’t be responsible for that.”I was late for the eiderdown season, but the pastor offered to lead me around the land and re-enact his summer ritual as he had done for the Japanese film crew. Dressed in an old Polish military uniform, he headed off across the flat plain towards the beach, hunting for any nests that he had missed. It was a still day, the silence broken only by the call of an oystercatcher, alarmed by our presence.Walking on this flat land, I felt as if I had missed out on a great gathering. All around us were hundreds of small piles of crushed mussel shells, the remnants of the eiders’ feasting, ground up by their powerful gizzards. Quartz-like, these remains had an understated beauty, glinting in the light. “In the later part, everything is going crazy,” the pastor said. “Birds and chicks running around. Arctic terns attacking all the time. It’s good to have a broomstick.”Later, as we made our way back to the church, the pastor let out a cry and pointed to a nest that he had missed during the previous gathering. Covered in moss, grass and broken eggs, it looked like a furry grey omelette or pancake. He wedged his stick under the down, easing it gently from the grass, and picked it up. Laden with seaweed, twigs and dirt, it reminded me of the contents of a vacuum cleaner, half fluff, half debris. Unlike the clean down my wife had held, it had a pungent, mouldy aroma, suggestive of the sitting duck from which it came. Looking closely, I saw the remains of several eggs caught up in the down. Rendered rubbery by rainfall, their fragments were proof of what the pastor had said he always allowed the ducklings to hatch before collecting their bedding. “Take it as a gift,” he said.Some 50 years before I visited Iceland, the Scottish writer Gavin Maxwell became momentarily possessed by Icelandic harvesting while living in Sandaig, a bay in remote western Scotland. He began to read about it and even travelled to Iceland on a research trip. Maxwell is best known for for his memoir Ring of Bright Water, which recounts his domestic life with several otters, but he also adored eiders. “Perhaps,” he mused, “it is their peculiarly uneven voices, or the way their massive bills ascend in a straight line to the top of their skulls without any ‘scoop’ in between. Or perhaps it is their curious and very inidual smell, which seems as if it could have nothing to do with a bird.”Unlike previous travel writers who described eiderdown, he dreamed of recreating the success of the Icelanders. From his cottage, he had noticed eiders nesting on a small island close to his home he counted only 30 pairs in total, but he imagined that he might turn it into a magnet for ducks. Inspired by Icelandic methods, he proposed erecting flags, wind propellers, scarecrows, artificial nesting sites, wind shelters and decoy drake eiders to attract the ducks. He concocted plans to feed the ducks with mussels and – apparently – even to entertain them with music.Maxwell wrote of harvesting in utopian terms, describing how early settlers had lured eiders with “an elaboration of fluttering flags, little wind-driven clacking propellers, and reeded wind instruments that would sigh, groan or trumpet, according to the strength of the breeze”. The Icelanders, he believed, had some sort of special ability to understand ducks that verged on the mystical. While he took copious notes on Icelandic techniques in an attempt to understand their success, he allowed that there was “a certain mystique” about the practice. “Some men,” he wrote, “seem to have ‘green fingers’ with Eiders.”When I visited the pastor, I was infused with Maxwell’s own vision of down, a contrast to stories of degradation and exploitation. Patient and sensitive, the pastor seemed to fit perfectly Maxwell’s vision, heroically guarding the ducks, never taking the down too early. And yet something didn’t feel quite right. In the 19th century, British, French, Scandinavian and American travellers, many of them scientists, started visiting Iceland, which was then a Danish colony. Wandering through its volcanic landscape, admiring the frames of its miniature horses and its colossal populations of eiders, or listening to the Icelandic tongue, they described Iceland in magical terms. Fed up with their descriptions of “scenes of thrilling horror, of majestic grandeur, and of heavenly beauty”, the explorer Richard Burton wrote of a condition called “Iceland on the brain”. I feared that I was falling into a similar trap, failing to write about another character in the drama.The Arctic fox – Vulpes lagopus – is the only mammal in Iceland whose presence predates the island’s settlement. Much smaller than its red cousin, the Arctic fox has miniature soft paws that are entirely covered in fur (hence its species name, which means “rabbit foot” in Latin). Perfectly adapted to the country’s varying seasons, the foxes can roam thousands of kilometres, their winter coats transforming from white to brown or even blue in the summer months.When settlers arrived with domestic animals, it was inevitable that they would clash with the Arctic fox. Fearful of the threat to livestock, farmers clubbed, trapped and later poisoned and shot them. Such was the fear of the foxes among Icelanders that a myth emerged that they had been sent by the king of Norway to punish settlers for their abandonment of their motherland. Legislation to encourage their extermination dates back to 1295, and even today each community in Iceland is obliged to hire a fox killer to visit all known dens in the area to exterminate their occupants.As I drove back from the pastor’s farm to Ísafjörður, it struck me as unlikely that the pastor, this kind man who refused to disturb an eider, was a true fox killer. Despite the military uniform, glasses and talk of guns, he never actually described killing a fox. I later asked his friend and neighbour, a long-time eider farmer, who really kills the foxes in the fjord. “I do,” he said with a smile. “The priest has never shot a single fox.”I wondered whether I had not experienced a sanitised version of down harvesting, one primed for the Japanese market. I asked around in the Westfjords, searching for the name of an effective fox killer. Again and again the same name popped up: Valdimar Gíslason. Famed throughout the Westfjords for his cunning and ruthlessness, he had raised a private army, a band of killers to protect their capital of eider ducks. Eider farmers spoke of him in hushed tones, revering him for his dedication to fox extermination.Gíslason lived in Dýrafjörður, the fjord beyond the pastor. The following week I visited him at his home, a sparsely furnished farmhouse that overlooked the fjord. His Danish wife, Edda, welcomed me in, the sound of choir music blending with the roar of an eiderdown dryer in a barn outside. A retired maths teacher, Gíslason has lived in the fjord for seven decades. Since his boyhood, he has gathered eiderdown from his land and pursued the foxes that wish to dine on his ducks. “Sixty-five years, 50 nights every spring,” he said, as if considering a mathematical problem. After so many nights of shooting, his hearing had begun to fade.The practice of poisoning or sedating eiders’ predators was once widespread in Iceland, carried out by farmers and government officials alike. Such techniques may have saved the lives of countless ducks, but they have historically proved highly destructive to the island’s ecosystem. In the early 1980s, for example, more than 4,000 ravens were killed per year under the country’s pest control programme. Worse, the disappearance of Iceland’s white-tailed eagle, which almost went extinct in the 1960s, has been attributed partly to the activities of eiderdown farmers. Although eagle numbers have now recovered, their torrid history speaks of what Andri Snær Magnason, himself an eiderdown farmer, calls the “dark side” of the eiderdown trade: however virtuous harvesters may be, they have a strong incentive to kill any species that threatens the prized bird.But there was another reason that explained Gíslason’s fondness for foxes, one I appreciated only once he brought out his notebook. Bound in red leather, it recorded the number of ducks that had come to his farm over five decades. In the early 1960s, it recorded more than 6,000 ducks, but gradually the figure began to decline. Today, Gíslason said, there are only 1,500 nests. I guessed that the foxes were to blame, but he replied that the fox was innocent it was his neighbours, his fellow hunters, who had reduced his take of eiderdown.When settlers first came to Iceland from Norway, fleeing political turmoil, they were confronted with a harsh subarctic landscape, devoid of large animals. As well as bringing their own domesticated animals and crops, settlers foraged along the island’s coastline for driftwood, molluscs, edible plants, eiderdown and beached whales. Such a windfall offered opportunities, but also potential for great conflict. Indeed, much of early Icelandic law deals specifically with harvesting rights for these scarce resources in order to avoid violence.The sagas piled on Gíslason’s shelf, those bloody tales of Iceland’s settlement period, recount how huge disputes would erupt between settlers over driftage rights, particularly over beached whales. Like the beached whale, the ducks in Gíslason’s fjord were a finite and highly valued resource any gain by a farmer in eiderdown would be offset by another’s loss. Yet it was impossible to conceive of any conflict over their down, to conjure a scene in which they ran towards the nests, turning their rifles on each other or making missiles of eider eggs. The fox had masked the competitive logic of the harvest, uniting the farmers in common cause, their quest to avert a duck massacre.I did not sense any cruelty in any of the harvesters I met, merely the simple, unsentimental coldness of a people who lived off the land, who killed or starved. All this said, part of me still preferred Maxwell’s version, his image of Icelanders with “green fingers”. Walking through the Hornstrandir reserve, the most remote area of the Westfjords, I would often see Arctic foxes patrolling the banks of rivers or the coastline, looking for birds and eggs. At night, I would listen to their high-pitched calls from my tent, my dreams populated with images of small children at play. Like the birch trees that once covered Iceland, the foxes were a reminder of what this island was like before the arrival of human settlers. To kill them was to assert a certain logic that felt at odds with the promise of eiderdown, its essential balance, and I began to hunt for places in the Westfjords that might fit Maxwell’s image.In writings on eiderdown, Æðey, a tiny island in the Westfjords peninsula, has assumed an almost pre-eminent status among nesting sites because of the vast size of its eider population. In the summer months, thousands upon thousands of eiders besiege the island, coating its grassland in brown and white hues, the sound of cooing drakes almost deafening the visitor.It took me some five hours by car to reach the pick-up point to Æðey. A mere 15 miles (24km) of water separates it from Ísafjörður, but the coastal roads of the Westfjords wind like furled ribbons, tracing the outlines of the fjords’ fingers. Driving along them, you seem to brush your destination, only to fold back on yourself, and repeat the process.From the pick-up point, I stepped on to a small boat belonging to Alexíus Jónasson, one of Æðey’s owners. In his mid-30s, Alexíus spoke perfect English, honed from years of reading Tolkien, Clancy and the instruction manuals for fish-processing machinery from his workplace in Ísafjörður. The sixth of seven generations who have lived on Æðey, he gathers down together with his two brothers, Jonás and Magnús. But Alexíus told me that it is their mother, Katrín, who is really in charge of the down harvest, a reminder of the key role that women and family matriarchs have traditionally played in the trade, from nest to bedding.Handling the boat with expert care, Alexíus guided us across the narrow stretch of water, scattering the seabirds on its surface. As we approached the island, I could hear the cries of his children playing in the water under the gaze of his mother. “It’s nice for them to be free,” Alexíus said, before we heard a high-pitched wail. “We get the occasional argument.”I followed Alexíus as he wandered across the island. We headed onwards to the island’s lighthouse, studiously avoiding puffin nests in the fissures that riddle the island. At the island’s tip we sat down on a rock, admiring the spouts of several humpbacks, there to feed in Iceland’s rich waters after journeying from their breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico.Watching the whales’ spouts rise and dissolve in the distance, it was easy to believe this place a rural utopia, a place where eiders could nest in peace and children roamed alongside geese, rabbits, puffins and horses. Around us life exploded from the water, the skies and the crevices in the rocks. All one had to do was to observe it, wait patiently and gather eiderdown. But then we were met by Tása, the family dog, whose job it was to catch any mink that swim over from the mainland. “She’s a gentle family dog,” Alexíus said, “but when she meets the mink she goes apeshit. It’s quite messy when she gets it. She starts one end and breaks every bone.”The recent history of the Westfjords is really the story of rural depopulation, of a vanishing culture next to the Arctic Circle. Over the past decade, countless farmers have packed up and left the region, tired of the weather, isolation and poor roads. The region’s tunnels and bridges, intended to increase mobility, have served as escape routes, emptying the fjords of Icelanders. “The government is always making it harder for people,” Magnús said. “There’s so little money in it, being a farmer, it’s becoming a lifestyle choice.”Unlike many livestock farms in the Westfjords, eider farms are still populated, their down a source of stable income. Faced with rising costs and falling profits, the brothers stopped sheep-farming in 1990. Instead, they chose to specialise in eiderdown. “It’s like a family thing,” Alexíus said. “Everybody helps out.”While the Icelanders manage the eiders, drawing them to their dwellings with the promise of protection, the ducks had also bound the farmers to these remote corners. “It’s like the ducks are keeping us here,” Magnús told me. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.”Yet there was another presence, one that silently haunted the harvesters’ imaginations, fed by novels or television: the men and women of ambition who wore the jackets or slept under the duvets. Unlike Icelandic wool sweaters, yoghurt or finance, eiderdown has, for much of its history, been an international commodity, first traded by the Danes, then – after Iceland’s independence – bought by middlemen in Europe and Japan. Far from isolated, Iceland’s 350 eider farms are connected to distant metropolises, with an invisible thread running between the ducks, the harvesters and the buyers, much of whose wealth, no doubt, is built on a form of resource extraction that is far removed from the gentle rhythms of down-gathering.In many remote communities, cut off from urban centres by the harsh contours of landscape, stretches of water or walls of rock, encountering the global market has been a source of trauma, leading to a collapse in the old ways of living and seeing. But I felt no quake on Æðey or indeed on any of the other eider farms I visited. Every season, the ducks came, and their down was harvested and shipped off to the middlemen for a stable price, much as has been done for centuries. And yet there were signs, too, that things might be changing, as Iceland continues to be shaken by the effects of the financial crisis, the influx of millions of tourists and rural depopulation. Like the sheep farmers, the eiderdown harvesters were getting fed up with the harsh weather and isolation. Many eiderdown farms, said Jón Sveinsson, another harvester, are merely summer houses, places of recreation for city dwellers. “The new owners are not interested in the pittance a few kilograms of eiderdown give. After all, they have come to the countryside to have a beer on the porch, fire up the grill and relax on the weekend, not to run around harvesting foul-smelling, flea-ridden eiderdown.”I tried to imagine what the Westfjords might look like in 50 years or so, as old ways of life faded away. “It’s not sad,” Sveinsson told me, “just different. The world is getting smaller.” But I did feel sad, thinking that this tradition might disappear. When I returned to the UK, I made a habit of checking in department stores to see if they had eiderdown quilts or pillows. Finding them in a shop window, I always felt reassured that the traffic in down continued, that this tradition still had a place in our own century of synthetics and factory farming. Nestled in silk covers, the down was always hidden from view, its rich history condensed into a short description on the label. Tempted by an act of mischief, I almost wanted to rip them apart, allowing the down and its stories to expand and escape outward.Adapted from Harvest: The Hidden Histories of Seven Natural Objects by Edward Posnett, published by The Bodley Head on 8 August and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a84fe5c28acbd3a033aab23987787ed7532461/0_12_3456_2075/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa35e684100a3a7680a7227390c1bdf8","title":"israeli spraying of herbicide near gaza harming palestinian crops","story":"Israel sprays buffer zone to deprive potential ‘terror elements’ of cover, but farmers in Gaza say crops and livelihoods are damagedIsraeli aircraft spraying herbicide beside the buffer zone along the Gaza strip is directly affecting the livelihoods of Palestinians in violation of international standards, a new report claims.The study tracked the drift of the herbicides on to the Gazan side and concluded it was killing agricultural crops and causing “unpredictable and uncontrollable damage”, according to the report’s main researcher.The report also concluded the spray is reaching more than 300 metres (980ft) into Gaza.The work was undertaken by Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at Goldsmiths, University of London, which spent 16 months investigating the potential effects of the spraying.The report’s lead researcher said that in the last five years Israeli planes have sprayed herbicide more than 30 times on the Israeli side of the buffer zone with Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, designated a terror group by the European Union.The Israeli Ministry of Defense told the  the spraying is necessary for security reasons, is “conducted only over the territory of the State of Israel” and is supervised by certified professionals.Farmers living and working in these areas, however, have long claimed that their crops and livelihoods suffer as a result.Using a video taken by Gisha, a Tel Aviv-based freedom of movement NGO, Forensic Architecture reconstructed the drift of the herbicide from a plane with the help of a fluid dynamics expert.It also analysed leaf samples, interviewed farmers and used satellite imagery to map the effects of the spraying. The resulting video report will be presented on Sunday, 21 July in Ramallah.It says harmful concentrations of the spray that surpass EU standards landed in areas where farmers had recorded damage in the past.“You see that there’s a protracted and continuous loss of greenness along the border that has over time flattened it and that isn’t recovering. It’s a piece of land that through bombings and the bulldozings and twice-a-year herbicidal spraying is becoming a barren and scorched dead zone.”Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2007 when Hamas seized control of the coastal enclave and Israel and Egypt imposed a land and sea blockade.Previous reports by the Israeli website +972 and Haaretz newspaper, along with freedom of information requests from Gisha, have unearthed similar findings about damage to the land on the Gazan side.The Forensic Architecture report provides further confirmation that the herbicide spraying has caused “unpredictable and uncontrollable damage” on the Gaza side, according to their researcher.Gisha, along with Adalah, a Palestinian rights group based in Haifa, and Al Mezan , a Gaza-based human rights group, have petitioned the Israeli military for compensation for farmers in Gaza who say they have lost crops due to the spraying.Israeli authorities have rejected the petition.However, they did provide compensation to an Israeli agricultural town, Nahal Oz, near the buffer zone in 2015, after farmers sued because they lost crops after a spraying.The Israeli Ministry of Defense did not respond to a specific question regarding wind direction, but said that the spraying is certified by professionals.“It is carried out by companies specialised in the field, in accordance with the law,” the ministry said in a statement.“The materials have been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, and are used in agricultural fields across Israel, as well as by other countries. The process is conducted and supervised by certified professionals.”This spring was the first time in five years that Israeli Defense Forces did not spray the border area and farmers in the affected areas reported better farming conditions, according to human rights groups.Gisha, along with Adalah and Al Mezan, said that if and when the next spraying occurs, they will use Forensic Architecture’s findings to petition Israel to stop the practice or to mitigate the damage, such as providing compensation or advance notice so that farmers can cover their crops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55bfb50f088dfcae9d939f81d834ab3f271a1410/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ba937c27335075d8678ca872ebfb21","title":"jacob zuma refuses to testify before major corruption inquiry","story":"Former South African president claims he was treated unfairly during cross-examination The former South African president Jacob Zuma has refused to testify before a major corruption inquiry, claiming he was being questioned unfairly.Zuma was scheduled to give evidence throughout the week. But when the court reconvened on Friday morning after a 48-hour adjournment at his request, the 77-year-old’s politician’s lawyer, Muzi Sikhakhane, said he would take no further part in proceedings.Sikhakhane said Zuma had been subjected to “relentless cross-examination” in a process that had become “political”.Late on Friday his legal team said a compromise had been reached and the former president had agreed to submit statements to the inquiry in response to specific questions.The inquiry is mandated to investigate allegations of “state capture” in South Africa during Zuma’s presidency, which ended last year when he was ousted amid graft allegations.It was set up after an ombudsman’s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers, Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, and senior officials in Zuma’s administration.The report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour had taken place, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies had acted improperly.In testimony on Monday, Zuma said he had been smeared and that he was the victim of a conspiracy organised by foreign intelligence agencies. On Tuesday, he appeared increasingly uncomfortable as he was questioned by Raymond Zondo, the senior judge who chairs the inquiry.There were concerns Zuma might use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, who led the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to a convincing election victory in May but has so far been unable to fully assert his authority over the party. But such fears have so far proved unfounded.The ANC is deeply ided between factions loyal to Zuma and reformists who support Ramaphosa.Zuma appointed loyalists to hundreds of top positions in the police, tax revenue service, intelligence agencies and other public bodies.Ramaphosa, a labour activist and tycoon who served as Zuma’s vice-president, faces attacks from another state anti-graft agency over donations he received for his campaign to lead the ANC in 2017.Busisiwe Mkhwebane, an ombudsman constitutionally charged to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by state officials, told reporters on Friday that Ramaphosa had “deliberately misled” parliament about a 500,000 rand (£28,700) donation and violated the constitution.Questioned by opposition politicians, Ramaphosa first said the donation had been a consultancy fee paid to his son Andile by a company implicated in corruption of government officials. The president revised his answer in November to say that the money had in fact been a donation to his campaign fund. Mkhwebane accepted that the mistake had been made “in good faith” but said the president should “have allowed himself sufficient time to research … a well-informed response”. This amounted to deliberate deception and was thus unethical and unconstitutional, she said, a charge that Ramaphosa’s allies said was contradictory and would be challenged in court.Ramaphosa has repeatedly said he would be prepared to appear before the commission.The charge against the president will undermine his efforts to purge the ANC of Zuma’s supporters and distract attention from the Zondo inquiry.The ombudsman, known as the public protector, is appointed by the president on the recommendation of a parliamentary panel.This year, Mkhwebane’s report into a scandal involving huge government grants to a dairy farm was declared invalid by a court because of investigative shortcomings, particularly a failure to examine the role of senior ANC officials close to Zuma.Mkhwebane has also claimed that the public enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, a close ally of Ramaphosa, abused his powers during a stint as finance minister. Gordhan has denied the charge, which is seen as an indirect attack on the president.The mutual accusations of graft have underlined the depth of isions within the ANC and will further disillusion voters. A quarter of a century after the end of the apartheid system, South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world, with soaring unemployment, a flagging economy and high levels of violent crime.On Thursday troops were deployed in poor neighbourhoods close to the western city of Cape Town after a spate of gang-related killings. Earlier this year South Africans endured rolling electricity cuts.Zuma faces a separate corruption investigation involving 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa’s armed forces in 1994. He denies the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78c36d006fef59185b36f65c94e33774af20c6f/304_360_842_505/master/842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d06b8e576adcdae0693c361fa616af73","title":"yang hengjun china tells australia to stop interfering in writers detention","story":"Beijing attacks ‘irresponsible remarks’ of Marise Payne and says it is conducting a lawful inquiry into case of Australian academicChina has told Australia to stop interfering in the investigation of Chinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun and to stop issuing “irresponsible remarks”.The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said on Friday the federal government was “deeply disappointed” that Yang had been transferred to criminal detention in China, saying he should be released if he was being held “for his political views”.

Photograph: iStockHundreds of bouncy castle operators face going out of business following a decision by the industry’s main UK-based insurance provider to withdraw from the Irish market. In what is the latest blow to small firms dependent on public liability cover, a spokesman for the industry said the move followed concerns about the claims environment in Ireland. Gerry Frawley of the Irish Inflatable Hirers Federation (IIHF) said the decision was made by Axa XL, the underwriter of the UK-based Leisure Insure that announced it was ending cover this week. Current policies will be honoured but not renewed from the beginning of August, affecting 280 IIHF members directly, but also many of the 700 other bouncy castle companies that are not members of the IIHF.Efforts are under way by the IIHF to find alternative cover. “As you all know this industry has had a difficult few years regarding Public Liability Insurance not least increased premiums and quote refusals,” the IIHF said in a recent statement to its members, announcing the decision. According to Mr Frawley premiums had recently risen from about €200 per unit per year to as high as €300 although claims were very rare. A large-scale withdrawal of cover, he said, will lead to concerns over operators working without insurance, threatening safety standards.ClosuresManagement at Pelican Promotions, a Co Louth company employing up to 36 people and with a store of 224 bouncy castles and inflatables, told their office staff the news on Thursday. “We have to close down,” said the family business owner Mandy Fee leaving no room for doubt. She said the firm had always been extremely safety conscious and had not had a successful insurance claim since they set up in 1991. “We can’t even sell off the business who’s going to buy it? It’s not just a case of closing down it’s a case of me losing everything,” she said. Pelican had considered moving its business to Northern Ireland at one point but were told by insurers there they would not cover the company’s activities in the Republic. As with other business owners, Ms Fee believes the scale of compensation payouts compared to elsewhere in Europe is to blame. ‘So many people’The losses will extend to other areas of the industry. Pelican has bookings until next May and uses face-painters and entertainers at corporate events around the country. This work amounts to 60 per cent of its business: “This affects so many people,” Ms Fee said. Both Pelican and the IIHF pointed to the demise in outdoor activities available to children as a result of the insurance issue. AXA XL said in a statement it had undergone a “strategic review” of its business with LeisureInsure and would not be renewing its Irish business as of August 1st. “We have concluded that current, well-documented market dynamics, mean this business does not fit our business plan going forward. Leisure Insure could be reached for comment last night.  Leisure Insure could be reached for comment on Friday night. However, a statement the IIHF said it had received on behalf of AXA XL explained it had “undergone a strategic review of our business with LeisureInsure Ltd in Ireland. We have concluded that current market dynamics mean this business does not fit our business plan going forward”.

Citizens then apply for a full passport when they return home.“What we’re looking for is time,” his father Joe told The . “Playing for time is the strategy.”The 37-year-old Cork native was arrested by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials last week, having overstayed his ESTA visa waiver when he entered the country in 2007. The father-of-three married his American wife Keran two years later. His green card applications were refused due to previous minor offences for marijuana possession.Mr Byrne had been given a deadline of Friday to sign the passport form which would allow him to be deported. If not, he faced being detained for a year or longer after which he will be tried in the courts.Mr Byrne’s legal team confirmed on Friday that they are considering further litigation in a bid to halt Mr Byrne’s deportation or to secure a hearing before an immigration court.Mr Byrne’s legal team had been seeking to have his fines for cannabis possession in Ireland vacated, arguing that they were not admissible in the United States. In particular, they have cited the so-called ‘John Lennon’ principle whereby the United States permitted the Beatles star to live in the United States despite previous convictions in Britain for possession of cannabis.In legal filings lodged this week, Thomas Griffin, the Philadelphia-based lawyer representing Mr Byrne, requests that authorities stop the imminent removal of Mr Byrne and allow him make his case before an immigration judge.Noting that Mr Byrne has had no dealings with police since arriving from Ireland on the Visa Waiver Program in 2007 he said that Mr Byrne “has never been a danger to the community and he is not a national security risk.”“With a family of US citizens who depend on him, home-ownership and a successful tax-paying business Mr Byrne is not a flight-risk,” Mr Griffin wrote in a letter to Simona Flores, director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agency in Philadelphia.“Mr Byrne’s custody has already torn him from his family, and his US citizen wife Keren and his three US citizen children who are on the verge of a massive upending of their lives,” the letter notes.Noting the support in the local Philadelphia community for Mr Byrne, as well as the extensive media coverage internationally, Mr Griffin notes that Mr Byrne runs one of the best and most-well known residential and commercial painting companies in the greater Philadelphia area. “Mr Byrne has consistently abided by the law, and has regularly paid business and personal taxes,” he writes.He also notes that Mr Byrne’s family will likely lose their house in the event of deportation as the mortgage is more than half of Keren’s nursing salary.Also included in the filing is a statement by Mr Byrne’s wife, Keren. “This hurts,” she writes. “Even though we knew this day might come nothing could have prepared me and us for what this feeling is.” Noting that the family has been “judicially and very methodically trying to ensure Keith’s permanent and legal residence in the United States,” she said: “We have been nothing but honest during all proceedings and applications for citizenship.”“He did not come here to “pull on the system,” he is working hard every day and contributing to society and most importantly to our home and our children. He is raising proud Americans who will know what it is like to work hard for what they want and what they need.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3961945.1563570054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit brussels is in waiting for boris mode coveney says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTanaiste  Simon Coveney was less than emphatic in response to a question about the necessity under EU rules for controls on animal-based food imports on the Border, ‘at the point of entry.  Photograph: Henry NichollsFile PhotoReutersBrussels, like Ireland and Britain, is in waiting-for-Boris mode, Simon Coveney told journalists here after one of his regular meetings with Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday.On the likelihood of a no-deal, the Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, said “the only person who can answer that question …. is the next prime minister and were going to have to wait and see who that is.”But he was less than emphatic in response to a question about the necessity under EU rules for controls on animal-based food imports on the Border, “at the point of entry”.He did not reiterate the usual insistence that in a no-deal situation there would be no controls on the Border, but insisted “we are going to do that in a way that doesn’t pose a security risk or undermine a peace process on the island of Ireland, and the European Commission is working with us on that.”Mr Coveney said he had been reassured by his meeting with Mr Barnier: “The EU position on Brexit remains consistent we stand ready to work with the new British prime minister as soon as they are in place to have an orderly and managed Brexit and to ensure that we avoid a no-deal Brexit.”He echoed German chancellor Angela Merkel’s reaffirmation of the centrality of the withdrawal agreement. “There are other things that can change and be adapted, particularly the future relationship document but the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation,” Mr Coveney said.Asked about Leo Varadkar’s comments in relation to room for compromise, the Tanaiste said that “what the Taoiseach has said is that he’s looking forward to meeting the new British PM whoever that may be, and hopefully welcome them to Dublin and hearing what they have to say in terms of the approach they want to take in regards to Brexit.”TheTaoiseach will be very clear, he said, “that the withdrawal agreement isn’t going to be renegotiated. It took two and a half years to put together. It involved compromise on both sides . It was designed around British red lines, and it is the agreement which all member states have now endorsed.”On border controls should a no-deal scenario arise, he said, “we’ve recognised that Ireland is not going to allow a situation whereby the Republic of Ireland effectively gets dragged out of the EU single market.“This is a single market, we are part of and we helped to create, and we are going to stay part of in the future. And to do that, protect the integrity of the EU single market in Ireland. Otherwise we would potentially face checks on goods leaving the Republic of Ireland going to other parts of the single market.“That is going to involve mechanisms that can deliver reassurance to both the European Commission and other member states that we will protect the integrity of the shared single market. But, we are going to do that in a way that doesn’t pose a security risk or undermine a peace process on the island of Ireland and the European Commission is working with us on that,” Mr Coveney said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Backstop guaranteeHowever, Mr Coveney, Dr Merkel and Ms de Montchalin all reiterated that the withdrawal agreement, which contains the backstop guarantee of no return to a hard border and was negotiated over 18 months with the British government, must remain the basis for an agreed exit. While their governments say they are willing to talk to the next British government, this would only involve the political declaration, the basis for the future trade agreement between the UK and the EU.Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump said Mr Johnson would do a “great job” and would fix Brexit as Britain’s prime minister.After speaking to the front-runner in the UK Conservative leadership race, the president told reporters he liked Mr Johnson and believed he would clean up the “disaster” left by his predecessor, Theresa May.“I spoke to him yesterday, I think he’s going to do a great job. I think we’re going to have a great relationship,” Mr Trump told reporters in Washington on Friday, when asked for his view on the favourite to become UK prime minster. “I think the previous prime minister has done a very bad job with Brexit – what can I say, it’s a disaster. It shouldn’t be that way. I think Boris will straighten it out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Iran crisis: British oil tanker seized in Strait of Hormuz as UK shipping warned to avoid area in Gulfpolitan Police denies its IT systems were hacked after bizarre messages appear on official Twitter feedUS forming \u0026#39coalition\u0026#39 of navies to protect ships amid Iran tensionsBritain\u0026#39s contribution to the EU rises by 20 per cent in a year, as UK\u0026#39s booming economy is used to prop up Brussels\u0026#39 budgetOnly 35 per cent of 2017 Labour voters want to see Jeremy Corbyn running the country, YouGov poll findsTesco raises prices of more than 1,000 products in past two weeks, including household staples such as pasta, rice and cheeseIris Goldsmith\u0026#39s parents pay tribute to their \u0026#39angel\u0026#39 daughter as inquest opens into her deathCats creator Andrew Lloyd Webber hails CGI which turns Hollywood stars into felines, but fans aren\u0026#39t sureWentworth\u0026#39s Chinese owners in new row as they admit they went too far in throwing out \u0026#39heritage\u0026#39 honours boardsCambridge college admits that a bell it had on display for decades was from a slave plantationStamp duty could be halved on homes worth over £500,000 to help \u0026#39empty nesters\u0026#39 downsize, under Boris plansDavid Davis tipped for shock Cabinet comeback under Boris JohnsonComment: Our new pro-Brexit Government must speak the language of libertyRevealed: The scandal of everyday food items being sold in \u0026#39excessive\u0026#39 wasteful plasticComment: We need a new Royal Yacht.

He said it was understood there were no British citizens among the two crews.US President Donald Trump said Iran was showing its true colours and warned that it was in “big trouble.  Northern Marine, a Clyde-based subsidiary of the Stena Impero’s Swedish owner Stena AB, said a “hostile action” had preceded the vessel’s change of course on Friday afternoon. The company issued a statement saying it had been “approached by unidentified small craft and a helicopter during transit of the Strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters”. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that they stopped the Stena Impero at the request of the maritime authority in the Iranian province of Hormozgan on suspicion that it had “violated international maritime law”, but did not elaborate. The head of Iran’s port authority was quoted by Guards-affiliated Tasnim news agency as saying: “We received reports of the British oil tanker, Stena Impero, causing problems, and therefore asked the military to guide the tanker towards Bandar Abbas harbour.”They said the Mesdar, whose transponder was also turned off, was briefly held and cautioned about “environmental regulations” before it was let go.Stena Bulk said the ship was in full compliance with all navigation and international regulations.There are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality, said Erik Hanell, president and chief executive of Stena Bulk. He said there had been no reported injuries.Tracking data showed the Stena Impero was in the same area that a United Arab Emirates-based vessel was detained on Sunday and where a British vessel, the British Heritage, was blocked by Iranian forces earlier this month.The move appeared to be in retaliation for Britain\u0027s seizure of the Iranian Grace 1 tanker in Gibraltar earlier this month.Rising tensions between UK, US and IranThe fate of the tanker has been at the centre of escalating tensions between the UK and Iran and was seen as a pawn in the standoff between the Islamic Republic and the West.Mr Hunt had hinted that the UK would release the ship if Iran promised its cargo would not go to the Syrian regime. The Foreign Secretary said talks with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, had been productive. However, a court in Gibraltar on Friday extended for 30 days the detention of the vessel, which was carrying two million barrels of oil.Tensions have been building for weeks in the Persian Gulf. On July 10, HMS Montrose intervened to drive three Iranian military vessels that were attempting to ert the British Heritage. Iran seized a Panama-flagged ship on Sunday, it alleges, for “smuggling oil to foreign countries”. Mystery surrounds the capture as no country has come forward to claim the ship or its cargo.The US claimed on Thursday to have downed an Iranian drone that had been flying too close to one of its navy ships. Iran denied the claims.Oil prices rose on Friday night after the tankers were seized.  The Trump administration is trying to block Iran’s exports to put pressure on it to renegotiate the 2015 nuclear deal it abandoned last year. Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz if it cannot export its oil. The seizure of the Stena Impero tanker in the Strait of Hormuz is the latest episode to contribute to rising tensions between the UK, US and Iran in the region.Here is a timeline of recent incidents involving the three nations:Rising tensions between UK, US and IranAfter a COBR meeting this evening, the government is urging UK shipping the avoid the Strait of Hormuz region.“We remain deeply concerned about Iran\u0027s unacceptable actions which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation.  We have advised UK shipping to stay out of the area for an interim period. “As the Foreign Secretary has said, our response will be considered and robust and there will be serious consequences if the situation is not resolved.“We remain in close contact with our international partners and there will be further meetings over the weekend.The British operator of the Stena Impero was in full compliance with all navigation and international regulations, a spokesman has said.Iran\u0027s state news agency IRNA quoted a military source as saying the vessel had turned off its tracker, ignored warnings from the Revolutionary Guards and was sailing in the wrong direction in a shipping lane.There are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality, said Erik Hanell, President and Chief Executive of the operator, Stena Bulk.There have been no reported injuries and the safety and welfare of our crew remains our primary focus.The ship is no longer under the control of the crew and remains uncontactable, he added.British oil tanker seized in the GulfLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, responding to the seizure of two British tankers by Iranian forces, said: The seizure of these vessels is unacceptable, and the tanker that remains under Iranian control must be released. Escalation risks a slide into an even deeper conflict.President Trump\u0027s decision to tear up the Iran nuclear deal fuelled the risk of full-scale conflict.A negotiated reinstatement of the nuclear deal through the UN is essential to wind down tensions and defuse the threat of war in the Gulf.Hours before the hijacking of the British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf, America\u0027s special representative for Iran was explaining its position to diplomats in Washington, Josie Ensor reports. Some 100 envoys took part in the briefing by Brian Hook, who outlined the Trump administration\u0027s initiative for maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz.Iran released footage on Friday from what it said was the \u0026#34downed drone\u0026#34Mr Hook said tensions had risen sharply and necessitated the need for a coalition of navies to protect their ships through the strait.Read the full story.US Central Command says the US has intensified air patrols over the Strait of Hormuz in response to the Iranian seizure of a British tanker.A Central Command spokesman, Lt. Col. Earl Brown, says a small number of additional patrol aircraft are flying in international airspace to monitor the situation.He also says Central Command\u0027s naval arm has been in contact with U.S. ships operating in the area to ensure their safety.Mr Hunt said the Stena Impero was surrounded by four vessels and a helicopter, and is heading into Iranian waters.The second ship - the Mesdar - was surrounded by 10 speedboats, Mr Hunt told Sky, though said it was not clear yet whether it had changed course.He said he had spoken to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo this evening about the situation and had tried to speak to Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif but he is on a plane.I will speak to him as soon as I can, Mr Hunt said.Mr Hunt warned there would be serious consequences if the situation is not resolved quickly. He told Sky News:We will respond in a way that is considered but robust and we are absolutely clear that if this situation is not resolved quickly there will be serious consequences.Asked if he could rule out military intervention, Mr Hunt said:We\u0027re not looking at military options - we\u0027re looking at a diplomatic way to resolve the situation - but we are very clear that it must be resolved.Freedom of navigation in the Gulf is absolutely essential. If that freedom of navigation is restricted, Iran is the biggest loser and so it is in their interest to resolve this situation as quickly as possible and we will do everything we can to do that.Iran\u0027s semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards had not captured the Mesdar.Despite reports, the ship has not been seized...and was allowed to continue its course after being warned about safety issues by Iranian forces, the report said.A spokesman for Norbulk Shipping UK confirmed the crew of the Mesdar are safe and well and the vessel has been allowed to continue its voyage.Sir Richard Dalton, former British ambassador to Iran, suggested the owners of the Stena Impero had been rash in sailing the tanker through the Strait of Hormuz.Speaking to Sky News, he said Iran\u0027s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had promised retaliation following the detention of Iran\u0027s Grace 1 tanker in Gibraltar.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei waving to the crowd during a ceremony attended by Iranian clerics in the Iranian capital Tehran, on July 16With hindsight, it\u0027s easy to say that this was a somewhat reckless act by the owners, given that there was no British naval vessel in the vicinity.He said the Iranians had lost their cool despite recent constructive discussions over the Grace 1.I don\u0027t think the Iranians will continue to try to seize British vessels given they have got what they want, which is something to hold in a negotiation with Britain about their cargo held, they consider illegally, in Gibraltar.Bob Sanguinetti, the CEO of the UK Chamber of Shipping, says: “We condemn unreservedly the capture of Stena Impero as she transited  the Strait of Hormuz earlier today.  The action by those involved is in violation of international regulations which protect ships and their crews as they go about their legitimate business in international waters.“Our priority is for the safety and welfare of the crew.  We call on the UK Government to do whatever is necessary to ensure their safe and swift return.An Iranian navy boat trying to control fire from the Norwegian-owned Front Altair tanker, said to have been attacked in the waters of the Gulf of Oman in June“This incident represents an escalation.  Whilst we call for measured response, it is also clear that further protection for merchant vessels must be forthcoming to ensure enhanced security to guarantee free flow of trade in the region.”President Donald Trump said he would talk to the UK about the incident.“We heard about it,” he said.We don’t have many tankers going in.” Donald Trump said he is being kept abreast of developmentsThis only goes to show what I\u0027m saying about Iran: Trouble, nothing but trouble, he said.Trump said Iran is showing their colors and in big trouble right now because its economy has been crippled by U.S. economic sanctions.The U.S. has asked Mideast allies like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in past weeks to contribute financially and militarily to a Trump administration proposal called the Sentinel Program - a coalition of nations working with the U.S. to preserve maritime security in the Persian Gulf and keep eyes on Iran.“I’m extremely concerned by the seizure of two vessels by Iranian authorities in the Strait of Hormuz.“I will shortly attend a COBR meeting to review what we know and what we can do to swiftly secure the release of the two vessels - a British-flagged vessel and a Liberian-flagged vessel.“Their crews comprise a range of nationalities, but we understand there are no British citizens on board either ship.Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary“Our Ambassador in Tehran is in contact with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to resolve the situation and we are working closely with international partners.“These seizures are unacceptable. It is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region.”A Government source said the crews on board the two ships are “a range of nationalities” but no Britons are among the crews of either ship. A Conta meeting due to start at 10.30 tonight will be chaired by either Jeremy Hunt or David Lidington. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

He said it was understood there were no British citizens among the two crews.US President Donald Trump said Iran was showing its true colours and warned that it was in “big trouble.  Northern Marine, a Clyde-based subsidiary of the Stena Impero’s Swedish owner Stena AB, said a “hostile action” had preceded the vessel’s change of course on Friday afternoon. The company issued a statement saying it had been “approached by unidentified small craft and a helicopter during transit of the Strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters”. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that they stopped the Stena Impero at the request of the maritime authority in the Iranian province of Hormozgan on suspicion that it had “violated international maritime law”, but did not elaborate. The head of Iran’s port authority was quoted by Guards-affiliated Tasnim news agency as saying: “We received reports of the British oil tanker, Stena Impero, causing problems, and therefore asked the military to guide the tanker towards Bandar Abbas harbour.”They said the Mesdar, whose transponder was also turned off, was briefly held and cautioned about “environmental regulations” before it was let go.Stena Bulk said the ship was in full compliance with all navigation and international regulations.There are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality, said Erik Hanell, president and chief executive of Stena Bulk. He said there had been no reported injuries.Tracking data showed the Stena Impero was in the same area that a United Arab Emirates-based vessel was detained on Sunday and where a British vessel, the British Heritage, was blocked by Iranian forces earlier this month.The move appeared to be in retaliation for Britain\u0027s seizure of the Iranian Grace 1 tanker in Gibraltar earlier this month.Rising tensions between UK, US and IranThe fate of the tanker has been at the centre of escalating tensions between the UK and Iran and was seen as a pawn in the standoff between the Islamic Republic and the West.Mr Hunt had hinted that the UK would release the ship if Iran promised its cargo would not go to the Syrian regime. The Foreign Secretary said talks with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, had been productive. However, a court in Gibraltar on Friday extended for 30 days the detention of the vessel, which was carrying two million barrels of oil.Tensions have been building for weeks in the Persian Gulf. On July 10, HMS Montrose intervened to drive three Iranian military vessels that were attempting to ert the British Heritage. Iran seized a Panama-flagged ship on Sunday, it alleges, for “smuggling oil to foreign countries”. Mystery surrounds the capture as no country has come forward to claim the ship or its cargo.The US claimed on Thursday to have downed an Iranian drone that had been flying too close to one of its navy ships. Iran denied the claims.Oil prices rose on Friday night after the tankers were seized.  The Trump administration is trying to block Iran’s exports to put pressure on it to renegotiate the 2015 nuclear deal it abandoned last year. Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz if it cannot export its oil. The seizure of the Stena Impero tanker in the Strait of Hormuz is the latest episode to contribute to rising tensions between the UK, US and Iran in the region.Here is a timeline of recent incidents involving the three nations:Rising tensions between UK, US and IranAfter a COBR meeting this evening, the government is urging UK shipping the avoid the Strait of Hormuz region.“We remain deeply concerned about Iran\u0027s unacceptable actions which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation.  We have advised UK shipping to stay out of the area for an interim period. “As the Foreign Secretary has said, our response will be considered and robust and there will be serious consequences if the situation is not resolved.“We remain in close contact with our international partners and there will be further meetings over the weekend.The British operator of the Stena Impero was in full compliance with all navigation and international regulations, a spokesman has said.Iran\u0027s state news agency IRNA quoted a military source as saying the vessel had turned off its tracker, ignored warnings from the Revolutionary Guards and was sailing in the wrong direction in a shipping lane.There are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality, said Erik Hanell, President and Chief Executive of the operator, Stena Bulk.There have been no reported injuries and the safety and welfare of our crew remains our primary focus.The ship is no longer under the control of the crew and remains uncontactable, he added.British oil tanker seized in the GulfLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, responding to the seizure of two British tankers by Iranian forces, said: The seizure of these vessels is unacceptable, and the tanker that remains under Iranian control must be released. Escalation risks a slide into an even deeper conflict.President Trump\u0027s decision to tear up the Iran nuclear deal fuelled the risk of full-scale conflict.A negotiated reinstatement of the nuclear deal through the UN is essential to wind down tensions and defuse the threat of war in the Gulf.Hours before the hijacking of the British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf, America\u0027s special representative for Iran was explaining its position to diplomats in Washington, Josie Ensor reports. Some 100 envoys took part in the briefing by Brian Hook, who outlined the Trump administration\u0027s initiative for maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz.Iran released footage on Friday from what it said was the \u0026#34downed drone\u0026#34Mr Hook said tensions had risen sharply and necessitated the need for a coalition of navies to protect their ships through the strait.Read the full story.US Central Command says the US has intensified air patrols over the Strait of Hormuz in response to the Iranian seizure of a British tanker.A Central Command spokesman, Lt. Col.

The move came after Cambridge University announced that it will launch an inquiry to see how the 800-year-old institution benefited from the slave trade.Researchers have been commissioned to pore over the university’s archives to how much it gained from the “Atlantic slave trade and other forms of coerced labour during the colonial era”.  The mission bell was donated to St Catharine’s College by alumnus Edward Goodland in 1961, three years after his arrival in the British colony of British Guiana, which is now Guyana.Mr Goodland, who studied at St Catharine’s from 1930-33 and went on to become a successful industrialist, moved to Guyana in 1958 after he was appointed as the technical director at Bookers Sugar Estates.According to an archived issue of the College’s magazine, St Catharine’s College Society, the bell was “believed to have been a plantation bell, used for regulating the work-schedules of slaves on the sugar plantations”.The magazine noted that the bell “can hardly have been cast in Demerara, and is believed to have been made on the Continent, perhaps in Holland, and probably some years before 1772.”The bell was initially hung in a belfry outside the Porter’s lodge where it was used to “summon College residents to food and to prayer”, the magazine says but in 1994 it was moved to a less prominent position in one of the accommodation blocks.From September 2020, the bell will go on display at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on slavery in the Dutch colonial period.Prof Sir Mark Welland, Master of the College, said: “The bell was gifted to St Catharine’s College in 1961 simply on the basis of the coincidence of name inscribed on the bell – ‘De Catharina’. It is time for the true history of the bell to be told as an educational tool.”Taco Dibbits, director of the Rijksmuseum, said: “In our exhibition, bells from across the world will represent the international dimension of the system of slavery, and the different meanings of bells for enslavers and enslaved.“With the bell from the De Catharina plantation, the museum will pay tribute to the enslaved people of Demerara, a forgotten part of the Dutch colonial era.“The Rijksmuseum is grateful to St Catharine’s College for this opportunity, and will explore together with the College the possibilities for a permanent location for the bell, either in the Netherlands or Guyana.”Iran crisis: British oil tanker seized in Strait of Hormuz as UK shipping warned to avoid area in Gulfpolitan Police denies its IT systems were hacked after bizarre messages appear on official Twitter feedUS forming \u0026#39coalition\u0026#39 of navies to protect ships amid Iran tensionsBritain\u0026#39s contribution to the EU rises by 20 per cent in a year, as UK\u0026#39s booming economy is used to prop up Brussels\u0026#39 budgetOnly 35 per cent of 2017 Labour voters want to see Jeremy Corbyn running the country, YouGov poll findsIris Goldsmith\u0026#39s parents pay tribute to their \u0026#39angel\u0026#39 daughter as inquest opens into her deathTesco raises prices of more than 1,000 products in past two weeks, including household staples such as pasta, rice and cheeseCats creator Andrew Lloyd Webber hails CGI which turns Hollywood stars into felines, but fans aren\u0026#39t sureWentworth\u0026#39s Chinese owners in new row as they admit they went too far in throwing out \u0026#39heritage\u0026#39 honours boardsStamp duty could be halved on homes worth over £500,000 to help \u0026#39empty nesters\u0026#39 downsize, under Boris plansDavid Davis tipped for shock Cabinet comeback under Boris JohnsonComment: Our new pro-Brexit Government must speak the language of libertyRevealed: The scandal of everyday food items being sold in \u0026#39excessive\u0026#39 wasteful plasticComment: We need a new Royal Yacht.

But, like the wider market, we have had to reflect these pressures in the price of some products.Price has been a major factor on the high street in recent years, driven by the rise and rise of discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl.Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: The key journey that the UK supermarkets are on is to narrow the basket with the German discounters, who also move prices up and down. That is a key axis that shoppers undoubtedly notice.Iran crisis: British oil tanker seized in Strait of Hormuz as UK shipping warned to avoid area in Gulfpolitan Police denies its IT systems were hacked after bizarre messages appear on official Twitter feedUS forming \u0026#39coalition\u0026#39 of navies to protect ships amid Iran tensionsBritain\u0026#39s contribution to the EU rises by 20 per cent in a year, as UK\u0026#39s booming economy is used to prop up Brussels\u0026#39 budgetOnly 35 per cent of 2017 Labour voters want to see Jeremy Corbyn running the country, YouGov poll findsIris Goldsmith\u0026#39s parents pay tribute to their \u0026#39angel\u0026#39 daughter as inquest opens into her deathCats creator Andrew Lloyd Webber hails CGI which turns Hollywood stars into felines, but fans aren\u0026#39t sureWentworth\u0026#39s Chinese owners in new row as they admit they went too far in throwing out \u0026#39heritage\u0026#39 honours boardsCambridge college admits that a bell it had on display for decades was from a slave plantationStamp duty could be halved on homes worth over £500,000 to help \u0026#39empty nesters\u0026#39 downsize, under Boris plansDavid Davis tipped for shock Cabinet comeback under Boris JohnsonComment: Our new pro-Brexit Government must speak the language of libertyRevealed: The scandal of everyday food items being sold in \u0026#39excessive\u0026#39 wasteful plasticComment: We need a new Royal Yacht.

And it remains so unbelievable in part because it was also the end of the most significant part of the space race, with space travel soon after never ascending to such heights or levels of interest again.Here is the facts about that Apollo 11 Moon landing, including when and how humanity managed such an accomplishment – as well as why.The three astronauts in Apollo 11 set off on 16 July, 1969. After flying for three days, they entered lunar orbit, and on 20 July, Neil Armstrong stepped out of the lander and became the first person to ever walk on the Moon.After more than eight days in space, they dropped down on Earth and were hailed as heroes.Created with Sketch.

No human has ventured there – or even outside of low-Earth orbit – since.With great difficulty. Which in turn was overcome by hard work and ingenuity, as part of\u0026nbspthe culmination of thousands of years of human curiosity.Why some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThe Moon is, obviously, a long way away: about 250,000 miles. And getting there also means leaving Earth’s powerful gravity, which is just as difficult, pulling anything down and requiring vast power.That power came in the form of the Saturn V rocket, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever made, and arguably the most mighty piece of machinery that humanity has ever put together.On top sat the three astronauts, in a much smaller capsule. The rocket carried the astronauts up into space, but it was this capsule that would carry them to the Moon and back, once they had managed to escape Earth.That capsule, known as the command service module, was actually made up of three parts: the command module, that served as the astronauts’\u0026nbsphome through the mission, the service module that contained the bits that powered them through space and kept them alive, and the lunar module.It was only that latter part that ever made its way to the Moon’s surface, after detaching from the rest and touching down on the ground. After Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had explored the Moon, they climbed back into the ascent stage part of that lunar module and used it to fly back up and attach to the main craft, which was being piloted by their colleague Michael Collins.They would then gradually float back to Earth, crashing down to land and completing their mission successfully.There was never any one justification for heading to the Moon. And many people thought we should head there for no reason at all – just because we can, and therefore should.But there was another pressing reason: because other people could. The Moon landing was the crescendo of the Space Race, which had seen the US battle with the Soviet space programme to get to a range of different milestones.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionWhy some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThat didn’t start with the Moon. Both countries – embroiled at the same time in the Cold War – flung rockets, satellites, animals and people into space to demonstrate their power, and putting a man on the Moon became the inevitable conclusion of that work.All of those various aims and desires came wrapped together in a speech given by John F Kennedy in 1961, which helped launch the race for the Moon and set down the reasons for doing so.“I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth,” he said.\u0026nbsp”No single space project in this period will be more exciting, or more impressive, or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.”Getting there helped improve science in myriad ways. A variety of breakthroughs came as a result of the work done to get humanity to the Moon, and when the astronauts touched down they also helped with scientific work in unprecedented ways – they gathered up Moon rocks, left behind sensors, and even the ways that their bodies responded to the stress and strangeness of space was studied to give information that is still being studied to this day.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“Unlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Certainly with an\u0026nbspuncrewed\u0026nbspvehicle I believe we could land on the moon in two years,” he told Time.\u0026nbsp“If it were to take longer to convince Nasa and the authorities that we can do it versus just doing it, then we might just do it. It may literally be easier to just land Starship on the moon than try to convince Nasa that we can.“The sheer amount of effort required to convince a large number of skeptical engineers at Nasa that we can do it is very high... But the for sure way to end the skepticism is just do it.”Created with Sketch.

Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time.

And you’d have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background,” he said.SpaceX could land on the moon by 2021, Elon Musk claims (SpaceX)“My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase Nasa’s budget.”With the increasing success of SpaceX, Mr Musk has since extended his ambitions for the firm. He believes that with innovations like reusable rockets, SpaceX can help humanity eventually become a multi-planet\u0026nbspspecies, with the eventual goal of saving our species from extinction.The SpaceX\u0026nbspand Tesla boss is known for his overly-ambitious timelines, though has also made a habit of eventually delivering on promises.Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspown estimates for returning to the moon are also ambitious, though slightly more conservative.

Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels.

But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious.

While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic.

FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original?

How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more.

Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok.

Now, the\u0026nbspspace agency is looking to put the first woman\u0026nbspand the next man on the lunar surface in 2024.“Being able to write that next chapter, knowing what has come before through Apollo and the shuttle programme, and knowing we are writing that next story is amazing.\u0026nbspIt is humbling to think about what they were able to do... especially considering they didn’t have the computing power we do,” she says. “That we are even in the same conversation... is incredible.”Spellman should know what the Apollo missions took, she works with veterans of that programme and while Nasa has had to build on that expertise over the past five decades the principles of that era-defining trip underpin\u0026nbspeverything she does.\u0026nbspThe current mission, called Artemis,\u0026nbspthe sister of Apollo, is daunting in itself. Having been set the task of returning to the moon in 2028, Donald Trump’s administration has\u0026nbspaccelerated that timeline. Vice-president Mike Pence said back in March that the later deadline was “just not good enough” and that “urgency must be our watch word”.While that may have something to do with that date being\u0026nbspthe end of a notional second term for Trump, the non-partisan Nasa is taking it in its stride.\u0026nbsp“It gets me really excited. I’m\u0026nbspexcited that we now have this really clear goal of boots on the moon by 2024... It is very helpful to have a crisp vision and goal so that we are all working towards the same challenge and the same objective.”Created with Sketch.The Epic Journey of Apollo 11 Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.New astronauts Ted Freeman, Buzz Aldrin (centre) and Charlie Bassett experience zero gravity in Nasa’s KC135 aircraft – affectionately known as the Vomit CometInventor Allyn Hazard tests a moon suit concept in a crater in California’s Mojave DesertGeology training, at Philmont Boy Scout Ranch, near Cimarron, New Mexico.

It read, ‘We came in peace for all mankind’The 50th anniversary edition of Norman Mailer’s ‘Moonfire: The Epic Journey of Apollo 11’Spellman is glad to not have to start with the “blank sheet of paper” that the Apollo missions did, and that another project manager Ken Poimboeuf has been there and done it. A veteran of the 1960s effort, Poimboeuf said earlier this month: “This place is history in the making and it’s not over yet.”“It is not going to happen overnight... but it is comforting to know we are going through some of the same growing pains,” she adds.NasaEPA)Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy space centre in Florida has seen its fair share of history beyond Apollo, having also been used in the space shuttle programme from 1981 to 2011 – but its latest guise is unprecedented. It will now accommodate Nasa’s heavy-duty Space Launch System (SLS), which will power the crew-carrying Orion capsule into the heavens.\u0026nbspAs an example of the sheer magnitude of the changes, more than 1.3 million feet of copper\u0026nbspwiring used in the Apollo era has\u0026nbsphad to be switched to fibre optics.\u0026nbsp“It is a pivotal time for us – we are now testing the mobile launchpad and the launcher together so we are building up the system... we are getting really close to that first mission.” An unmanned test flight of Orion is due next year, with a crewed test to follow in 2022.What happened as astronauts headed towards the MoonApollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketEverything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionBeyond Florida and the Nasa centres across the US, the elements around the mission are fraught. Some members of congress, who have to sign off the budget for Artemis, are wary of the costs and the few details provided so far.\u0026nbsp“We have a White House directive to land humans on the Moon in five years, but no plan, and no budget details on how to do so,” Kendra Horn,\u0026nbspchair of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics, said back in May just before a 2020 budget was announced. That budget called for an extra $1.6bn\u0026nbspto fund Artemis for that fiscal year, on top of the $21bn\u0026nbspthe president already requested for Nasa.Costs for the following years are yet to be established but will rise, with estimates that Artemis could cost $20bn\u0026nbspto $30bn or more in total.\u0026nbsp“You are sort of asking congress to put a down payment on a car, but you don’t know what you are buying and you don’t know how much it will cost,” says Dr Mary Lynne Dittmar, who has decades of experience in the space field and is part of the Users’ Advisory Group of the National Space Council – the body reestablished by Trump under the direction of\u0026nbspPence to help guide policy.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbsptold a Senate panel\u0026nbspon Wednesday that a budget impasse and subsequent spending freeze later this year would be devastating for the chances of the Artemis mission.However,\u0026nbspwith the mission looking to set down roots for “national capability for decades” rather than just two or three trips to the moon,\u0026nbspDittmar believes it is a “different ball game” to the “war footing” of the 1960s space race. Later space missions in the 1970s and 1980s were “trying to apply a model that was specific to that one point in time... now it is a much different landscape”. More infrastructure and more countries are involved – which means the conversations over how missions will take place and what is needed will take longer.Dittmar does not doubt the political will to put humans back on the moon, but the pressure of the deadline means that things have to happen relatively quickly. Recent staff changes at the top of Nasa, initiated by those within the agency, may indicate that the urgency created by the White House is having an effect.In his speech in March, Pence raised the prospect of the use of commercial rockets to keep the mission on schedule. “If commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be,” he said. There are certainly advocates who believe this is the right strategy and it could reduce costs.\u0026nbspCharles Miller, who was part of the Trump administration’s transition team for Nasa in 2017 and was senior adviser for commercial space at Nasa from 2009 to 2012, believes that such partnerships between Nasa and outside companies are “fundamental”.\u0026nbsp“Artemis is an opportunity to have a complete break with the failed space policies of the last couple of decades... to open up the solar system in a way that is completely affordable and could be transformational,” he says.Why some people still believe that we never went to the Moon“If we go back to the moon in the way Trump wants and the way Obama did before him, by leveraging commercial partnerships, it can also be much faster and be of much more benefit to the world,” he adds. Miller, who is a serial space entrepreneur, says that if billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are putting up capital and so “have skin in the game” it is a win-win, even if there have been some failures in the past.I think the overall strategy the Nasa administration wants to execute will succeed, the only question is when... The old model of the ‘big costs and aerospace needs’ is on the verge of collapse,” he says.Dittmar, who is also chief executive\u0026nbspfor the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a trade group of more than 65 companies, sees things differently. She believes the space market needs to be at a tipping point where investors and company shareholders see the potential for returns and we might not be there yet.\u0026nbsp“I think public-private partnerships have a place, yes. Do I think it is a panacea? No,” she says,\u0026nbspalthough it is more likely the market may be in shape by the time Nasa is looking at heading to Mars once the Artemis mission is complete.\u0026nbspFor Dittmar, who was involved with work on the International Space Station (ISS), the implications of the Artemis mission are beyond business or even the limited scope that the Trump White House is projecting.\u0026nbspShe is looking for American leadership in space and being able to “keep the door open for others”. More than 100 countries have been involved in the various facets of the ISS mission both on the ground and in space and such cooperation will be crucial to make the most of the moon mission and beyond.Nasa\u0027s next great mission to the moonDittmar remembers the 1969 landing and says that it represents “one of the shining moments in humanity on par with figuring out the Magna Carta”. But the full impact may not be felt for generations and it is the same with the new mission.\u0026nbsp“I do believe that other nations are going to be watching and thinking ‘what does this mean for us?’” she says. “Inspiration is not just public inspiration its inspiration in engineering, in technology development.”“We are also going to learn about ourselves as human beings – being challenged by new environments,” Dittmar adds.Inspiration for the next generation is a key motive for Spellman, who has a young son.\u0026nbsp“We want this reality of working in maths and science to hit kids all over the world,” she says. “Now there is so much access to what we are doing – can you imagine the live feed coming from the moon and kids watching that? It will put it at the fingertips of children across the world and make it real to them that they could do something like this.”In fact, Spellman hopes the Artemis mission will provide a cultural touchstone for everyone.\u0026nbsp“I hope the mission brings us all together, for at least\u0026nbspa moment,” she says. When you think about everyone sitting around watching their televisions or listening on the radio when Neil Armstrong was taking the steps on the moon, it would be great to have that moment again.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.1062 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1162 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1262 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1362 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1562 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1662 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1962 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2162 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2262 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2362 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2562 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2662 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2762 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2862 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2962 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3262 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3362 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3462 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3562 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3762 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3962 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.4062 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4162 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4262 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4362 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4562 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4662 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4862 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4962 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 5062 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5162 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5262 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5362 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5462 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5762 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5962 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6162 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6262 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 162 Love Island\u0027s Ovie kisses new girl IndiaLove Island\u0027s Ovie kisses new girl India on the terrace after stealing her from Chris in last nights show.262 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.362 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.1062 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1162 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1262 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1362 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1562 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1662 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1962 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2162 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2262 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2362 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2562 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2662 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2762 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2862 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2962 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3262 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3362 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,”\u0026nbspMr Khan said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Aside from Glastonbury, few other events spark so much excitement around the unveiling of their lineup. And while there are fewer “rock and roll” names on the billing this year, Primavera is leading the charge when it comes to proper representation of artists from different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders – without sacrificing anything in terms of quality. More than 50 per cent of the lineup is comprised of female-fronted acts, including Cardi B, FKA twigs, Christine and the Queens, Charli XCX, Robyn, Janelle Monae, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kate Tempest, Sigrid, Courtney Barnett, Yaeji, Peggy Gou and Helena Hauff. You’ve also got Interpol, Future, Nas, Mura Masa, Suede, Tame Impala, Kurt Vile and Mac deMarco. So it’s not as though guests will be short on options.Belgium’s biggest music festival often scores the most impressive lineup of any in Europe, and this year is no different. But don’t let the name mislead you: Rock Werchter’s lineup is always eclectic, and this year’s will include headline performances from Florence + the Machine, Muse and The Cure, plus Mumford and Sons, The 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, Kylie Minogue, Weezer, Brockhampton, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mac DeMarco. The festival site is situated on a farm near the town of Leuven, which is just a half-hour train from Brussels so festival-goers can choose to stay in the city if they don’t feel like camping. Organisers take special care to ensure good accessibility for all, so there is a separate entrance for less physically abled guests, and plastic surfacing over the grounds for easier wheelchair use.Roskilde is the biggest festival in northern Europe, so you expect big names – and each year organisers deliver. This year it’s going big on “the power of pop” and its ability to bring people together, so you have avant-garde artists like Christine and the Queens plus goth-rock legends The Cure. Also on the billing are Jungle, Tears for Fears, Alma, Julia Holter, Parquet Courts, Travis Scott, Brockhampton and Flohio. You’ll be joined by more than 130,000 fellow music lovers, and situated right next to the Danish capital of Copenhagen with easy connections by train, bus and air.This has to be the best lineup of any festival this summer, plus it’s cheaper than Glastonbury and the weather will surely be better too. Artists performing include The Cure, Lauryn Hill, Vampire Weekend, The 1975, The National, Bon Iver, Robyn, Years \u0026amp Years, Mogwai, Sharon Van Etten, Iggy Pop, Gossip, Iggy Pop, Bonobo and Jorja Smith. The festival’s ferris wheel is the stuff of legend, providing guests with beautiful views of the festival site and beyond. Things don’t really kick off until around 6pm either, so there’s plenty of time to take in the surrounding art galleries, flea markets, parks and more fantastic restaurants, bars and shops than you could ever hope to visit in the space of one trip. Plus there’s a great indie disco that goes on until the early hours.There are so many reasons to try this festival in Portugal’s coastal capital. Let’s start with the music: each year Nos Alive manages to assemble a most erse yet cohesive lineup of artists, from pop and rock to electronic and heavy metal. This year its headliners are The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Gossip, The Smashing Pumpkins and Bon Iver. If that’s not impressive enough, you can also catch Jorja Smith, Hot Chip, H.E.R, Thom Yorke, Idles and Loyle Carner. The festival is set on the docks near two of Lisbon’s most breathtaking landmarks: the Jeronimos Monastery and the Belem tower. Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason. Rock en Seine takes place at the historical site of Domaine National de Saint-Cloud, which is regarded as one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. The lineup is comprised of a mix of global stars and some of the most exciting international up and comers, from Foals and Aphex Twin to Agar Agar, Sharon Van Etten, Bring Me the Horizon and Polo \u0026amp Pan.Primavera is one of the biggest and most anticipated festivals around.

There were about five or six homes burning and firefighters were trying to save the houses near to those that were on fire. The heat from the fire was so intense that the firefighter could only stand near the burning building for 10-15 seconds before having to move away - Justin SullivanThis was only one of several large-scale forest fires in Brandenburg state in Germany last year, following droughts which left the forests in the region extremely dry. The year set a new record for fires that burned over 400 hectares. As a photojournalist covering the region for over 15 years, I now have to assume either drought or floods will very likely be a part of the news we will be covering every summer - Sean GallupThis photograph was taken at a sunflower field at Goersdorf near Golssen in Germany. The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue - Sean GallupOn the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills. I captured this photo in Big Bend, as the story was shifting away from the fire itself and focusing on trying to locate missing persons and recover remains of those who had perished - Justin SullivanYou can see the Belchatow power plant and the rising steam and smoke from over 20km away. I went there the day before the start of the United Nations’ climate conference in Katowice, which took place in a region where coal has a long history and coal mining is woven into local tradition. I stayed the night at an alpine hut near the Waxeggkees glacier in Austria. An employee I talked to at night said, sometimes (this was August) she heard the sounds of ice breaking off the glacier and crashing across rocks. 100 years ago the glacier would have filled the photo. Now it takes over an hour to walk up to where the glacier begins - Sean Gallup, photographerI came across Mr. Helmut Kujat, 78, by chance after I photographed a parched farm nearby. He’s actually pouring the water into a tube that helps to better let the water reach the roots of the tree. He waters the trees in front of his house almost daily throughout spring and summer due to droughts and heat waves - Sean GallupI took this photo about a week after the Camp Fire tore through the town of Paradise, California in November last year. It was the first opportunity to use a DJI Mavic Pro 2 drone to view the widespread devastation since the air space around the burn zone had been closed - Justin SullivanI stumbled on the firefighter in front of the burning home on the second day of the Camp Fire in a town called Magalia which is about five miles from Paradise, California.

In the video a voice can be heard saying: “There’s a tornado over there look.”\u0026nbspMr Teasdale added: “Never seen anything like it… love a bit of extreme weather.”In a tweet to The Independent, Mr Teasdale described the scene which had unfolded at the flower show: “It were big, it were windy and it was like an otter’s pocket,” he said of the wet weather.Bruce Moran took photographs of a damaged car and part of a\u0026nbsproof which had been blown down to the street.“Yup. Tornado tore through Hale. Bonkers.” he wrote on Twitter. “True story. Tiles, roofs, trees...smashed cars. Seemingly a 5 minute torrent of madness.”Elsewhere, Martin Kevill, 32, tweeted some footage of an uprooted tree in Cheshire with the words: “Erm there’s been a tornado in Mobberley.”Mr Kevill\u0026nbsptold PA the tornado hit the small village at around 4.45pm.“We were in the pub over the road and heard some pretty abnormal gusts. The pub rumbled and we ran outside to see what it was.“The road was pitch black and it was really dark.”He added: “When the gusts passed, a tree ripped up and fell over into a field of llamas.“Then after a moment or two, the clouds moved along and it was actually quite clear again apart from the rain.Tornado warning as Tropical Storm Barry sweeps Gulf StatesHorse rescued and dragged to safety after tornado flings it into bogMassive thunderstorms in US midwest bring ‘as many as 40 tornadoes’“I think a tree went over the train line a few metres away. The llamas are fine but there’s a valley of horrific building damage through the area.”Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said the ingredients needed for a tornado are unstable air through stormy conditions and “wind shear”.Wind shear is air travelling in different directions at different heights in the atmosphere.“Those ingredients were there at the right time across the Manchester area this afternoon,” he said.It is known as a funnel cloud until it touches the ground and causes damage.The UK normally sees between 30 and 50 tornadoes a year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unlikely alliances have formed. Improbable heroes and villains have emerged.One of the most extraordinary transformations\u0026nbsphas been\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, whose shift\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbsployal chancellor to no-deal critic and then backbench rebel is nearly complete.“Spreadsheet Phil” – as he is sometimes known in Westminster – has spent nearly a decade at the top of government, precisely because he is seen as reliable, measured\u0026nbspand probably a little dull.But those days appear to be over. Over the past few months, Mr Hammond has been increasingly outspoken about\u0026nbspthe economic risks of a no-deal Brexit, something he fears is not being given serious consideration by Brexiteers.His disquiet\u0026nbsphas been more apparent since Boris Johnson stormed in front in\u0026nbspthe Conservative leadership contest with his repeated promises to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 49Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Steve Messam poses next to his monumental landscape artwork \u0027Hush\u0027 which hangs in the moors of Teesdale on July 18, 2019 in Barnard Castle, England.

The aerobatic display team have been granted formal approval on Wednesday to perform for audiences, known as Public Display Authority (PDA), to mark the official start of the Red Arrows\u0027 55th display seasonWith Mr\u0026nbspJohnson poised to enter No 10 next week, Mr Hammond is preparing to quit,\u0026nbspknowing full well that he would otherwise be\u0026nbspsacked by Mr Johnson.His actions over the past few days show that he will be a crucial\u0026nbspfigure in the\u0026nbsplooming Brexit battles this autumn.On Thursday, Mr Hammond was among four cabinet ministers who defied the government to abstain on a vote to prevent Mr Johnson from suspending parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit.Mr Hammond was spotted in Downing Street by photographers at the very moment he was supposed to be voting against a\u0026nbsprebel amendment to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill – which passed with a large majority.In\u0026nbspordinary times, the\u0026nbspchancellor\u0026nbspdefying\u0026nbspa three-line whip would be an explosive political story. Mr Hammond not only abstained on the vote but he actively\u0026nbspwanted people to know he had done so.Hammond-led plot to sink no deal could kill off Johnson’s Brexit plansHe\u0026nbsptweeted:\u0026nbsp“It should not be controversial to believe that parliament be allowed to sit, and have a say, during a key period in our country’s history.”Mr Hammond seems to be at the head of an unlikely bunch of Tory rebels, a gaggle of sensible ministers who cannot get behind Mr Johnson’s demand to keep no deal on the table.Pro-EU ministers Greg Clark, the business secretary, Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, and justice secretary David Gauke\u0026nbspalso abstained, which suggests they know they are on their way out as well.It has been suggested that Mr Hammond played a key role in organising the rebellion, sending encouraging text messages to Tory ministers and urging them to abstain.\u0026nbspThe defeat is a taste of what prime minister\u0026nbspJohnson faces over the coming months.Ms May had a tough\u0026nbsptime trying to contend with the Brexiteers snapping at her heels, but Mr Johnson will have to go up against a\u0026nbspbunch of radicalised former cabinet ministers, who command the respect of plenty of Tory MPs.Mr Hammond has even suggested he might be prepared to bring down the government should the new PM push for a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Grieve and former chancellor Ken Clarke have also said they would consider such a move.If the Tories lose a by-election on Wales next month, the government’s working majority would be reduced to three – leaving Mr Johnson with almost no room for manoeuvre.If Mr Hammond becomes a “nightmare on the backbenches”, as he joked at a Treasury party earlier this month, then\u0026nbspMr Johnson may find delivering Brexit as difficult as his predecessor.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The other three countries have brought in varying degrees of restrictions on Huawei.Theresa May is reported to have pressed through the inclusion of Huawei in the UK telecoms infrastructure at a meeting of the National Security Council two months ago. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, was subsequently sacked for allegedly leaking the decision to the media.However no formal announcement has been made on the decision.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanCommittee chairman Dominic Grieve said: “The debate over whether or not Huawei should be allowed to supply equipment to the UK 5G network has dragged on long enough and is damaging the UK’s international relationships. The new prime minister must take a decision as a matter of priority.”The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) stated: “The UK is keen for a strong economic relationship with China. But this is not a ‘pro’ or ‘anti’ China debate. China will continue to be a key partner for the UK: one we respect greatly”.But, it continued: “The UK must not do anything that jeopardises the Five Eyes intelligence sharing relationship – the value of the partnership cannot be overstated.Trump reveals US companies will be allowed to sell to HuaweiNokia backs away from executive’s scathing attack on Huawei“Looking to the future, we must take action to reduce our over-reliance on a Chinese technology. We need to consider how we can create greater ersity in the market. This will require us to take a long-term view – but we need to start now.“In terms of the immediate issue, restricting those companies who may be involved in our 5G network will have consequences,\u0026nbspboth in terms of time and cost. And the government must weigh these, together with the security advice that any risk posed could be managed in a secure system, against the geostrategic issues outlined.“It is important to take the right decision, and take it we must: this debate has been unnecessarily protracted ... The new prime minister will no doubt have many issues to deal with in his first days in office. Nevertheless, this committee urges him to take a decision on which companies will be involved in our 5G network, so that all concerned can move forward.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But these increases are still slower than pay rises that are happening on average in the private sector.”“With the partial exception of schools, there seems to be no new money to fund these pay rises, meaning savings will have to be made elsewhere.”But Labour branded the rise “insulting”, and shadow chancellor John McDonnell added: “After years of holding back the pay of our dedicated public sector workers, it is shameful for the government to pay for ending the public sector pay cap with more cuts.”Brexit study hailed by Johnson says he is wrong to brand May’s ‘dead’Theresa May uses final speech to hit out at ‘populists’May now thinks telling people to ‘go home’ is wrong.

The 23-time grand slam winner went through to the next round 6-3, 6-2The\u0026nbspRevolutionary Guards also denied they had captured the\u0026nbsptanker, Iran\u0027s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, quoting regional military sources. The report said it\u0026nbspwas allowed to continue its course after being warned about safety issues by Iranian forces.Stena Bulk, the owners of the Stena Impero, said it was “was approached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter during transit of the Strait, while the vessel was in international waters” at 4pm UK time.There were 23 crew members aboard, the company said in a statement, adding that there were Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino in nationality.The ship is no longer under the control of the crew and remains\u0026nbspuncontactable, the spokesman added.A port authority chief was quoted by Tasnim, which is closely affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard,\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspsaying: “We received some reports on the British oil tanker, Stena Impero, causing problems, and therefore we asked the military forces to guide this tanker towards Bandar Abbas harbour to have the required investigations carried out.”Unnamed sources were also saying the tanker had been causing pollution by dumping oil residue.Stena Impero is seen to stop in its tracks before turning towards Iran (Marinetraffic)Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said Tehran’s actions were “unacceptable”, while industry leaders called for greater protections for merchant vessels following the escalation.Defence sources told The Independent there was surprise in Westminster at the seizures, given the UK’s recent offer to release the Grace 1, impounded near Gibraltar two weeks ago, if Iran could guarantee it would not travel to Syria.Sources added that the destroyer HMS Duncan, currently sailing to relieve the HMS Montrose in the Gulf region, may well now operate alongside the frigate. The Montrose faced down Revolutionary Guard gunboats as they tried to impede the progress of a BP oil tanker through the Strait last week.Mr Hunt convened a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee following the seizures. In a statement, he said: “Our ambassador in Tehran is in contact with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to resolve the situation and we are working closely with international partners. These seizures are unacceptable. It is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region.”\u0026nbspIran says maybe US downed its own drone as Gulf crisis simmersAfter the ministers met, a government spokeswoman said they were deeply concerned about Iran\u0027s unacceptable actions which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation.\u0026nbsp We have advised UK shipping to stay out of the area for an interim period.\u0026nbspShe added:\u0026nbsp“As the Foreign Secretary has said, our response will be considered and robust and there will be serious consequences if the situation is not resolved.\u0026nbspWe remain in close contact with our international partners and there will be further meetings over the weekend.US president Donald Trump said he would consult with Britain about the incident, following a verbal battle with Tehran earlier in the day over whether a US navy ship had indeed brought down an Iranian drone in the Strait this week, which Tehran denies.Bob Sanguinetti, of the UK Chamber of Shipping, condemned the Revolutionary Guard’s move. He said: “The action by those involved is in violation of international regulations. This incident represents an escalation. Whilst we call for measured response, it is also clear that further protection for merchant vessels must be forthcoming to ensure enhanced security to guarantee free flow of trade in the region.”The seizure of ships comes after weeks of rising tensions not just over Grace 1 being sequestered, but Iran’s restarting of uranium enrichment in protest at tough US sanctions.After Mr\u0026nbspTrump unilaterally withdrew the US from a long term nuclear agreement it had signed with five other world powers including the UK, tensions have worsened.\u0026nbspIran has refused to negotiate any changes, and has threatened to further break the terms of the agreement if Europe does not help limit the effects of US sanctions. It has also broken restrictions on its production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs.European leaders want to maintain the agreement but have not been able to address Iranian demands, particularly concerning the sale of oil, without violating the sanctions.The Stena Impero’s seizure marked a “more significant escalation”, according to Vikram Singh, a former deputy assistant defence secretary under Barack Obama. He told Sky News: “Even more than with the drama of the downing of drones … this starts to seem like a really major threat to the transit of oil and energy supplies.”The incident could push European powers closer to the US on Iran policy following the schism over Mr Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, Mr Singh added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pictures suggests that the ship is \u0027likely\u0027 to have been hit by a mine as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo moves to blame Iran for the suspected attackHere is a timeline of recent incidents involving the three nations:13 June: Two US oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz were attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift, with 44 sailors evacuated from both vessels. The US Navy went to assist, with Mr\u0026nbspTrump blaming Iran for the incidents.Iran denied involvement in the tanker attacks and accused the US of promoting an Iranophobic campaign.20.20 June: A US military drone worth $100m\u0026nbsp(£78m) was downed by Tehran, with Iran\u0027s president Hassan Rouhani claiming it had violated their airspace.The move marked a new high in the rising tensions between the two countries, as Iran\u0027s naval commander warned his forces would not hesitate to down more US drones if they entered its airspace.Mr Trump then pulled back from the brink of retaliatory military strikes on Iran after he was told 150 people could die.He has since signed an executive order targeting Iran\u0027s supreme leader Ali Khamenei and his associates with financial sanctions.4 July: Royal Marines from 42 Commando were involved in an operation to seize a supertanker off Gibraltar suspected of carrying oil destined for Bashar Assad\u0027s Syrian regime. They boarded the ship by descending on ropes from a Wildcat helicopter and by using rigid inflatable boats.They worked alongside authorities in Gibraltar to detain the Iranian tanker Grace 1, which was believed to be heading to the Banyas refinery in breach of EU sanctions. In response, Iran\u0027s revolutionary guard warned a British oil tanker could be seized in retaliation.10 July: Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose drove off three Iranian vessels which tried to stop the commercial ship British Heritage.It is understood the tanker was making passage out of the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz when the ship was approached by the Iranian vessels. HMS Montrose was nearby and proceeded to come in between.Warnings were given but no shots were fired. The Iranian vessels then turned around and left.11 July: Police in Gibraltar said they had arrested the captain and chief officer of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 in relation to suspected violations of EU sanctions on Syria.Two days later the force said the captain, chief officer and two second officers of the vessel had been conditionally bailed without charge.13 July: In a telephone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt offered to facilitate Grace 1\u0027s release in return for guarantees from Tehran that it would not breach EU sanctions on the Assad regime in Syria.15 July: Mr Hunt attended a Brussels meeting of EU foreign ministers on the issue of the Iran nuclear deal. He\u0026nbspsaid there was a small window of hope for preventing the international agreement, aimed at stopping Tehran gaining nuclear weapons, from unravelling.Both he and Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson later ruled out supporting Mr Trump should he pursue military action in the Gulf.16 July: Ali Khamenei called the seizure of the Grace 1 tanker piracy and vowed to retaliate.\u0026nbspHe said: God willing, the Islamic Republic and its committed forces will not\u0026nbspleave this evilness without a response.17 July: US officials said they suspected Iran had seized a Panamanian-flagged oil tanker from the United Arab Emirates as it travelled through the Strait of Hormuz.\u0026nbspThe tanker had turned off its tracker three days before as it entered Iranian waters.Iran later said its Revolutionary Guard had seized a foreign oil tanker and its crew of 12 for smuggling fuel out of the country.18 July: Mr Trump said the USS Boxer had shot down an Iranian drone that came within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored calls to stand down.Iranian military officials denied one of its drones had been lost in the Strait of Hormuz.19 July: Two oil tankers are reported to have been seized by Iranian authorities in the Persian Gulf.The Stena Impero, registered in the UK, was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Strait of Hormuz for violating international maritime rules, the semi-official Fars news agency said.A second oil tanker, the Liberia-flagged Mesdar, owned and operated by Glasgow-based firm Norbulk, appeared to veer off course towards the Iranian coast.The Mesdar\u0027s operator said the ship was boarded by armed guards but the crew were left safe and well and allowed to continue their voyage.Jeremy Hunt called the ships\u0027 seizure unacceptable ahead of attending a meeting of the Government\u0027s emergency committee Cobra.Press Association contributed to this reportStrait of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She’s welcome to it — and to abusive clowns like vice-president Frans Timmermans who delights in mocking Britain.We can’t wait to be out.WE commend the Labour peers who have publicly denounced Corbyn for allowing their party to become a cesspit of racism.But there’s a problem. If a new Tory leader is forced into an early election, what will all these Lords and Ladies do We’ll bet good money that they and the “moderate” MPs apparently repulsed by anti-Semitism will campaign enthusiastically again for a Corbyn government.The reality is they will happily install a racist in Downing Street, to the terror of Britain’s Jews,he’s got a red rosette.If their concerns genuinely trumped everything, they’d have already found a way to boot out Corbyn and his lackeys — or left Labour, as others have.The anti-racism outrage has its limits, though, doesn’t it WHY is the Government letting the BBC dodge blame for the licence fee betrayal of the over-s  It’s time it pushed back.The funding deal they struck in  was clear enough: the free licences are expected to reach £million next year and the corporation would foot the bill from its huge £.billion annual bung.This overstuffed media empire, with its lavishly paid execs and celebrities, now says it cannot afford to without scrapping popular channels. Rubbish.It is vital for old folk to have a TV. Everyone knows that.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was careless use of language, meant in electoral sense and in no way literally. While we should be robust in our opposition, we do have to carefully consider impact of our words and I failed to do that.Questionedhis leadership prospects have been damaged by his prominent role in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, during which he was Energy Secretary, he insisted this was not the case.He said: No, because I fought the Tories day in, day out.We stopped them putting even heavier welfare cuts, we stopped them cutting education.Jo Swinson has been Sir Vinces deputy for two years, and speaks for the party on foreign affairs.In the  general election she lost her East Dunbartonshire seat to the Scottish National Party, but won it back two years later.She also said there is no immediate prospect of becoming allied with either the Tories and Labour as both are currently led by Brexiteers.On Brexit, Ms Swinson wants to block a no-deal scenario - an outcome she compares to planning for your house to burn down and will do whatever it takes to stop Brexit.We have had in our history of the Liberal Democrats and predecessor parties, ious points at which it has been tantalising close to totally breaking the mould of British politics during the s, she said.We have an even better opportunity now and thats what we absolutely do need to grab hold of.The -year-old said this is ambitious and she does not underestimate the challenge of the Lib Dems needing to boost their  MPs by  to form the next government.She has put equality and ersity at the heart of her campaign, while Sir Ed has championed decarbonisation.The leader will be chosen by Lib Dem party members. Just over , people have been sent ballot papers.The Lib Dems have been led by Sir Vince after Tim Farron resigned in June , saying he felt remaining faithful to Christ was incompatible with leading his party.Around  per cent of Lib Dem members voted Remain in the referendum and most are relaxed about immigration.The poll will close on June .Thats also the day the new PM is expected to be revealed.This has meant the exact timing for the announcement of the next Lib Dem leader is yet to be set.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will perform an MRI scan and then perform a surgery to separate the ‘heads’”.Although rare, there have been other reports of babies being born with more than one head, especially in African nations.This type of birth defect is referred to as an encephalocele.According to the NHS, an encephalocele is a rare congenital type of neural tube defect where part of the skull has not formed properly.So a portion of brain tissue and associated structures are outside the skull.According to reports, babies diagnosed with an encephalocele have a  per cent survival rate.The long-term prognosis for survival becomes less likelythere are other complications, such as associated defects or syndromes orbrain tissue protrudes into the sac.Approximately  per cent of these infants who do survive have ying degrees of mental deficit.On March , an expert team of neurosurgeons at Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciencessuccessfully operated on an infant with two heads.According to reports, the father of the newborn had tried to bury him alive, fearing he would not be able to afford his treatment.He was rescued by police near Nowhatta town in Jammu and Kashmir.Doctors were able to separate the abnormal brain from the normal brain, along with skin after three-hours of laborious surgery.The baby was later adopted by his uncle."},{"url":null,"title":"human remains septic farmer 1982","story":"Brenda Venables disappeared in  aged  from her home in Kempsey, Worcestershire, and her husband David still lives in the area.Maintenance workers raised the alarm on July  and police later made the grim discovery.West Mercia Police confirmed today the remains belong to an adult female, and are working to identy who they belong to with DNA.Detective Chief Inspector Carl Moore said: The results enable us to confirm that the bones discovered are that of an adult female.We are aware this is concerning for the community of Kempsey, the wider Worcestershire area and for those with missing family or friends.

Acanthamoeba organisms do not generally cause harm to humans , but they can cause a serious eye diseasethey infect the cornea.Symptoms can include:To avoid Acanthamoeba keratitis, never wear your contact lenses when youre coming into contact with water.Never wash contacts with tap water and never swim, shower or use a hot tub while wearing them.Always clean your contacts in lens solution the moment you take them out, or use daily disposables rather than monthlies.Nick Humphreys, , from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, has had to have two operations and is now waiting to have a corneal transplant after contracting a parasite burrowed into his eye.And last week we reported how a mum-of-two from Sydney feared shed lose her eyesight after a parasite burrowed into her eye when she went swimming in her lenses.Meanwhile, a teenager from Cornwall, says she developed a form of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis , after she contracted the parasitic infection.Skye Wheeler, , says she lives in constant fear that the bug - which is still sleeping in her eye - could cause her to go blind, or even kill her.In this recent case, the woman tested   in her left eye, making her “legally blind”.She was given medication to treat the infection but sadly never regained her vision due to her scarred cornea.The woman later underwent a partial corneal transplant, which improved her eyesight slightly and thre report says she is no longer in pain.The Acanthamoeba infection often travels through undistilled water, soil and even air.Those who use contacts put themselves at riskthey don’t take proper precautions — by removing the lenses before swimming and showering, or using tap water to clean them.According to a poll by YouGov for the sight charity,  per cent of contact lense wearers wear their contacts for longer than the recommended  hours a day, with  per cent saying theyd swum or showered in them.Meanwhile,  per cent said they had slept with contacts in, and  per cent said theyd put their contacts in their mouth to clean or lubricate them."},{"url":null,"title":"athens earthquake powerful tremor strikes greek capital sending people running into the streets","story":"Experts say that the earthquake had a . magnitude and caused communication systems to fail.All public buildings in Attica have been evacuated after the earthquake hit at midday today.The epicentre of the quake was  miles northwest of the city and had a focal depth of  kilometres.There are no reports of injuries or damage currently.This comes as ferocious storms ripped through a tourist region in Greece earlier this month, killing at least seven people.Around  others were reportedly injured after gale-force winds rain and freak hail storms struck the Halkidiki peninsula in northern Greece.More to follow...For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online.Thesun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-le stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video.Download our fantastic, new and improved free App for the best ever Sun Online experience.

Her legacy speech typied her time as Prime Minister: Empty, uninspiring, forgettable, plodding and meaningless. If she was leaving the Big Brother house and they had to show her ‘best bits’ there would be an embarrassed silence before going to the adverts. Her actual legacy is three years of stubborn dithering that left Britain in a worse state than when she took over. Or rather, left us with Boris Johnson. Which is a bit like leaving a floater in the toilet at No. When historians describe her premiership, they won’t need to list her failures, like the botched general ­election or the Brexit red-lines ­shambles.    They won’t need to mention the falling letters during a conference speech or the P from a prankster. All they’ll need to write is the name of the least competent minister in the history of politics, whom she refused to sack: Chris ­Grayling. That, alongside a photo of his gormless mug, will perfectly capture how Britain became the laughing stock of the world. Even his name, Failing Grayling, was an era-defining moniker. This was the man who delivered more limp ­disappointments than a crate of snide Viagra.And as the minister also known as Mr Bean II, The Phantom Ferry Man, or Frank Spencer With a Condom On His Head – as he has always appeared to me – leaves the front benches, we need topay tribute.Because as the Shadow Attorney General Karl Turner noted during Grayling’s final Transport Questions session on Thursday, he was “the gt that kept on giving”. The problem was most of what he gave away went to private firms. Labour produced figures that showed his errors cost British taxpayers £.billion. Say that slowly. Two billion, seven hundred million pounds. In cock-ups. Which could have built five state-of-the-art hospitals serving city-sized populations. His greatest mishits included wasting £bn on the collapsed Virgin Trains East Coast franchise, almost half a billion on a bungled probation service privatisation and £million on a contract to a ferry company that didn’t own any ferries.

Lucy Noble, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, is so money savvy she has already done all her Christmas shopping - by buying gts in the January sales. The -year-old, who is dubbed tightapos by her pals also s full-price items as soon as they go into the sales and then buys them again at the reduced price. Virtual assistant Lucy said: My mates say that I’m tight, but I say I’m just thrty. I’m obsessed with making savings – it takes over your le. I do spend a lot of time on my phone. I would say about two to three hours a day looking for offers. My husband tells me off quite a bit for it.    I’ve always been a bit of a bargain hunter and started trying to save money when I was in my early s. My sister used to sell a lot of stuff on eBay, so I started doing that, then it went on from there. But itaposs only in the last few years that Lucy, who is married to Chris, , and mum to Abbey, six, and Owen, nine, has come into her own as a coupon fan and bargain hunter. She said: I’ve been taking it more seriously for the last couple of years. I discovered you could save quite a lot of money by using coupons.With Facebook you can join all these dferent money saving groups, with people looking for bargains or saving tips, she said.Years ago I would cut supermarket coupons out of magazines and now you can find them online and from using dferent apps on your phone. There are receipt scanning apps, where you enter your receipt and get so many points then they send you vouchers. I’ve had Amazon vouchers which I’ll end up saving for Christmas.  I search ‘latest freebies’ and you can get all sorts – food, make-up, toys, as well as skincare samples. I will sign up to do product testing. By doing that, St Tropez sent me a full-size fake tan bottle worth £. And one of Lucyaposs top tips is to join groups which alert thrt shoppers to bargains. She regularly uses Try It, which tells users when emails are going out offering freebies, the Ashleigh Money Saver websites, which informs members about sales or deals offered by retailers and Reward Me Now app – which lets you buy a code to get discounts of up to  per cent – which can be used alongside other offers. Lucy was thrilled when she saved £ just by using the vouchers to buy dinner and drinks in her local pub. She said: I get such a buzz when I see a bargain. Last Christmas I got some dressing gowns for £ each and they reduced the price two days later, so I took them back and got a refund, then bought them again for £.. Most of my friends say, ‘Oh I wouldn’t dare to do that,’ but I’m saving money, so why wouldn’t I  It was £. to spend on something .    I willthings evenbuying them again in the sale only means saving a couple of pounds, because I would rather have that money back. I’ve ordered things online before, then realised two days later they have reduced the price, so Iaposve ordered them again at the cheaper amount and sent the originals back to get a full price refund. Lucy has even managed to get her weekly shop down to £ for a family of four, which works out at just under £ a day. She uses offers and the Feed your Family for Around £ a Week Facebook page and with careful meal planning, saving more than £, a year. Lucy said: Some people say they don’t have time to do it, but it doesn’t have to take a long timeyou plan carefully. Before I go shopping I will check online for offers, check the apps and then decide what supermarket to go to. I’m thinking about what I’m going to do for the kids’ tea throughout the week and how many meals I can make from something. Nothing is wasted. I cook stuff like Bolognese from scratch, working out how much we will eat and freezing the rest. If we have a chicken we will use everything – we’ll even use the carcass for stock for a soup. You can also buy fresh vegetables for just as little. You can find them for p.    I go to the local butcher who often has offers on, too, and stock up, putting items in the freezer. It’s great, as I’m saving money and the kids are eating healthily. It’s just about being organised and being savvy. I used to spend about £ a week and I’ve managed to reduce that by £ which really adds up over a year. And it isnapost just the food shop where Lucy saves a fortune - sheaposs also the queen of booking cheap holidays.  She said: We shop around for the cheapest deal. We managed to get a holiday this summer for four people for £, – flights and accommodation in Benidorm and that’s during the school holidays, when things are at their most expensive. I was speaking to someone at the school gates who was spending £, to £, on their familyaposs summer holiday, so we’ve saved lots of money. We book flights separately using dferent websites to look for cheaper ones and self-catering accommodation in quieter, more residential areas. We then budget to spend  euros a day. We donapost eat every meal out and buy food from the local supermarket, which saves a lot of money.  I’ll book activities online before we go, too. My husband found you could go on one site and book activities in advance, paying  euros instead of  euros at the resort. When it comes to having the perfect family Christmas, Lucy is already organised by July - including wrapping all her presents. She said: I do most of my Christmas shopping in the January sales. I’ve got an airing cupboard full of stuff all wrapped up, which is a bit of a nightmare. I also get birthday presents, sothe kids end up going to a party they have a gt already. I make a note of all the things I’ve bought so I don’t forget. Friends will spend £ to £ per child at Christmas, while I don’t really have a budget, but I try and keep it below £. Having things bought and wrapped takes so much of the stress out of it. Friends will go out on Christmas Eve to get presents and I can’t think of anything worse than doing that. I’ll also collect make-up samples, which make great little gts, and looking out for free items you get with magazines. Quite often you’ll pay £ for the magazine and get a mascara worth £, so I’ll go to dferent shops to buy the same magazine but with a dferent gt. I am bargain crazy andI see a shop closing down I’ll have a really good look for stuff. I want to seeI can get stuff for as cheap as possible.  I will pay full price occasionally, but very rarely, andI can I will get it discounted. I have no idea how much I save, but I think it must be thousands of pounds, especially when you take into account the savings on holidays. I get stuck with the label of being tight, butI can save money that will go into my savings - meaning we can take the kids on a nice holiday, so it’s worth doing.” Lucy’s top five tips: . Use coupons and cashback websites . Plan your meals for the week . Do not be afraid to take items back. That’s money in your pocket rather than in the retaileraposs till. . Double up by using vouchers and discount codes together. .to get freebies in the post.

Sarah Boyle, , was left traumatised after bungling doctors misdiagnosed her with triple negative breast cancer at the end of . The hospital only realised their error several months later - after which point Sarah had already received extensive treatment and surgery. The mum-of-two had undergone several rounds of gruelling chemotherapy treatment, a bilateral mastectomy and breast implants at Royal Stoke University Hospital.    In an added blow, she has since learnt her reconstructive surgery may now potentially put her at risk of developing cancer in the future. She has also suffered psychological trauma as a result of her ordeal and also continues to endure ongoing symptoms caused by her treatment. The mum, a call centre worker, made headlines in  after telling how she believed her baby son had saved her le by repeatedly rejecting her left breast during feeding, leading her to suspect breast cancer. She said at the time: If I offered him that booby he would completely freak out, heaposd become extremely distressed and would scream the house down.    He just wasnapost having it. I had no problems with my left breast but every time I tried with my right he would start screaming and get very upset. He wouldnapost go near it. She told how she first noticed a lump in her breast in  but a GP told her it was cyst and nothing to worry about. She had it scanned five times over the course of four years before having Teddy. When he was six months old he rejected her right breast altogether, and she took her fears to the hospital, which scanned her and diagnosed grade  triple negative cancer - a rare, non-hormonal form of the disease. Sarah was also initially told that her cancer treatment may lead to fertility issues, but fortunately she went on to have a second child, Louis, who is now seven-months-old. However, she was unable to breastfeed him due to her treatment. Sarah, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., with husband Steven, , and her two children Teddy and Louis, said: “The past few years have been incredibly dficult for me and my family.    Being told I had cancer was awful, but then to go through all of the treatment and surgery to then be told it was unnecessary was traumatising. “And while I was delighted when I gave birth to Louis, it was really heartbreaking when I couldn’t breastfeed him. “Asthat wasn’t bad enough, I am now worried about the possibility of actually developing cancer in the future because of the type of implants I have and I am also worried about complications that I may face because of my chemotherapy. “While nothing will change what I’ve been through, I really need some answers on what is being done to make sure nobody  suffers in the same way I have.”  Sarah was aged  when she was misdiagnosed by blundering doctors following the birth of her youngest child. She was later informed by her treating doctor, Mr Narayanan, that her biopsy had been incorrectly reported and it was confirmed that she did not have cancer. Her legal team from Irwin Mitchell says a histopathologist misreported the cells as cancerous when they weren’t.    Sarah instructed specialist medical negligence lawyers to investigate the case Awho have now secured an admission of liability from University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust. Sarah Sharples, a legal expert at Irwin Mitchell solicitors who is representing Sarah, said: “This is a truly shocking case in which a young mother has faced heartbreaking news and a gruelling period of extensive treatment, only to be told that it was not necessary. “The entire experience has had a huge impact on Sarah in many ways. While we welcome that the NHS Trust has admitted to the clear failings, we are yet to hearany improvements have been put in place to prevent something like this happening again.

In its farming heyday the  acre island - a  minute ferry ride from the seaside town of Rothesay - had a population of . But its last permanent resident, a farmer, left there in . Since  the isle has been owned by a couple who have used the main property there as a holiday home. They are now selling the entire isle that that comes with the four bed house and several uninhabited buildings. It also has its own in-hand farm, native woodland a small private harbour and bespoke ferry.    It has a fascinating history, having been a target of Viking raids and used as a D-Day training ground - with bomb craters still visible in its landscape. A farmer even discovered the remains of a local Bronze Age woman, the Queen of the Inch, on the island in the s. She lay in a stone cist wearing a black lignite necklace and carrying a flint dagger.  The owners have put it on the market with estate agents Strutt  Parker. Diane Fleming, sales agent for Strutt  Parker in Edinburgh, said: Inchmarnock is a stunning island rich in possibility. There is already a successful farming enterprise and a lovely family home on the nearby shore of Bute but there is signicant potential to build up the sportings, develop the existing residential offering and to capitalise on the ious amenities offered by the island such as the native woodland, watersports and fishing.  A Scottish island embodies the romance many people associate with the countryaposs prime estates and farms. Inchmarnock is stunning with great heritage and is a peaceful and secluded haven, yet it is relatively accessible from Scotlandaposs central belt. We expect signicant interest from national and international buyers.

She cleans it all and throws out anything that looks contaminated - but says most of what I bring home we eat. Her children, River, , Molly, , Thomas, eight, and six-year-old Wesley all enjoy the sweets she finds during her nights spent dumpster-ing. Stacey says her kids love her hobby and it saves her £ a month on household items.   The mum from Utah, USA, was brought up in a tight knit family who lived a very frugal lestyle.She remembers re-using items discarded as a child with her father and fell in love with frugal living. As an adult she picked up this habit but her first husband wasnapost too keen on her lestyle which caused a rt between them. However, she has since remarried to another man, Danny, , who embraces her ways. She has since saved anywhere from £- £a month on household goods.    Stacey said: I grew up in Pennsylvania in a large, close knit family we lived a very frugal lestyle. We didnapost waste anything and sometimes we barely made ends meet. But my parents worked hard for everything they had and that made it more valuable and precious. My parents were experts at taking what others discarded and using it to create a beautul, full le for all of us. As an adult with my own family I did the same it felt wrong to do anything dferently than what I was taught.  Wasteful, entitled mindsets always confused me. People threw away hours of their labour by simply having a disconnect from the fact things equal money. I was married to a man who didnapost really understand this mindset, so we had issues with those dferences. But I am orced now and remarried to a man that is one hundred per cent my teammate and celebrates those things with me. We are extremely frugal and donapost have any shame in picking through rubbish to get good, useful stuff to enrich our lives.  Stacey said they also sell some things to have some aposfun moneyapos - for eating out, activities and entertainment. It ies a lot, but we seem to have enough for a little fun each month, she told. Being frugal is really the only hobby I have, aside from working out and Iaposm just fine with that. I would not buy the things I find, more often than not. As far as usable items I find, I would wager I save us at least fty to three hundred dollars a month on things we need, such as a new vacuum or dish soap and toilet paper.  She has also sold numerous items she found in bins online including soap, toothpaste, decorations, party supplies, clothing and toys. Iaposve sold things at yard sales I sell items on a website called KSL, Stacey said. I give items away we donapost use but someone  could use. I give items as gts for many occasions. I give items to friends and family who could use them and even have some request I look for specic things. We use household goods every day found in dumpsters.

Dr Zhengmao said the boyaposs intestines had been perforated and immediately operated, finding four damaged areas. Surgeons managed to successfully remove the magnetic balls.  Dr Zhengmao told local media: This kind of tiny magnetic ball is quite dangerous for [a] kid because it has strong magnetic power. If a child eats just one ball then he can excrete [it] easily, but usually kids eat several balls which attach in a shape, damaging the stomach and intestines.

She studied hard, earned a degree in international relations at London South Bank University and dreamed of a career with a humanitarian organisation or the United Nations. A devoted daughter of two Post Office workers who had come to Britain from Pakistan, the family observed Muslim customs without being strict and Diana wore a headscarf when she was around them. But then her world was abruptly turned upside down. In a drastic bid to avoid an arranged marriage, she gave up everything and travelled to Iraq to become one of a small band of British jihadi brides.Here, in an exclusive extract from his new book, Operation Jihadi Bride: My Covert Mission to Rescue Young Women from ISIS ,former soldier John Carney reveals her story, how he rescued her and her new le back home in Britain... Diana had been led to believe the holiday with her two brothers had been arranged as a gt for her doing well in her degree. What she had not imagined was their trip to Pakistan was to introduce her to her future husband, a distant cousin from the rural village. Malik was twice her age. He had yellow teeth and didn’t speak a word of English. As Diana gazed at Malik across the room, her world fell apart. When they ed to London, Diana couldn’t eat. She couldn’t sleep. She cried bitter tears. She tried to reason with her parents but a wall had grown up between them. They had allowed her the freedom to go to university. That was enough. After  years in England her parents were outwardly liberal, assimilated, but their mentality remained in the Hunza Valley. Diana wanted to run away, but to where, with whom  Her education had all been for nothing.  She went on ­line and wat­ched docu­­­­mentaries made in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan. She wept over photographs of children with missing limbs in shattered hospitals. Diana had lived obliviously in London while people like her were fleeing their homes from firebombs, shelling, drone attacks and barrel bombs. She found her way to a chat room where she made friends with a woman her own age named Eva, a British-born Muslim who had fled to the ISIS caliphate. As she and Eva talked through the night on Skype, Diana felt uplted, inspired, needed. Eva offered an alternative, the chance to really find herself. When she woke the following morning, the knots in her stomach had untied. Diana took her savings from the bank. She found her passport in a drawer and crept out of the house before daybreak, dressed the way she always had. She had a one-way ticket on the Eurostar from St Pancras to the Gare du Nord. In Paris, she caught the Deutsche Bahn for Stuttgart and Budapest, where she changed trains for Istanbul. No one asked any questions. Why would they     People had tracked her journey. Two lads were waiting for her at the station in Istanbul. They drove her to the city’s smuggling hub in Aksaray. There she joined several other girls in a Volkswagen  van that took them across country to an unguarded spot in the razor-wire fence iding Turkey from Syria. She changed from blue jeans into a long black abaya with a full-face niqab. She knew before she reached Mosul that it had all been a terrible mistake. Every girl who travelled to the caliphate and married a jihadi had their own story, but at the heart of each one was the culture clash between their daily le and experiences in Europe and the demands of Islam. It was nine months later when I spoke to Roy Underwood a contact in Mosul, Iraq. “There’s a girl here, Sophian. Australian. She’s got a baby and wants out, like yesterday…” “Can we get to her ” “I told her to wait till we were liberated by you guys. But the baby needs treatment for something or other.“Hey, man,” he said, like it was anafterthought. “Hope you’ve got room for another one ”“Another what ” “Another girl. She’s already tried to get out once. She’s dead keen to have another go.” “More the merrier, mate,” I told him. I spotted Roy, hands behind his back. His faint nod said he had recognized me.  He strode through the throng. Two women in black, one with a baby, bobbed along submissively in his wake. He opened the sliding rear door and waved his hand dismissively as they climbed in. He snapped the door shut. Some men risk their lives to save unknown babies. Some men throw live babies into burning pits with their dead mothers. British intelligence would tell me that anyone who had joined Islamic State was considered an enemy of the state and should be executed. Members of humanitarian organisations wanted to bring these people home to de-radicalisation programmes and fair trials. A fresh fusillade of shells thumped into the walls along the route. Visibility through the dust storm was down to a few inches, shielding us from the jihadi machine guns. They were keeping their heads down and the few bursts they let off pinged from the vehicles without doing any serious damage. In  minutes we were back to the relative safety of the Kurdish lines then through the contemporary ruins of Mosul to the prehistoric ruins of Nineveh. The girls had not spoken a word. I glanced over my shoulder. They were motionless like two black statues holding hands. The baby was silent. Traumatised babies don’t cry.    “You can take your headgear off nowyou want to,” I said. It was a couple of seconds before they did so. It was obvious which of the two girls was Sophian, she was holding the baby. It was even more obvious who the other girl was. Her photograph was on my laptop. I must have looked at it a hundred times. “Diana Abbasi,” I said. “Mr Carney.” Back in Erbil, Diana and Sophian washed in the clanking apparatus we called a shower. When they finally appeared, Sophian and Diana had transformed from unidentiable black sacks into normal young women in the embroidered dresses of the Kurds. The pair were painfully thin, with pronounced cheekbones, stick wrists and haunted expressions. They ate without speaking or looking up, one plate after another. I made mint tea and we sat at the table nursing the glasses. “Thank you,” Sophian said. She glanced at her baby, Yusuf. “I had to get out for him. You can’t imagine…” She broke off. Tears flowed down her gaunt cheeks. She sobbed. It was contagious. Diana sobbed too. Two young women overcome with relief, the tension pouring from them like an electric current. “What can’t I imagine ” I asked softly. Sophian brushed at her tears with the back of her hand. “It’s like a story on another planet. You know, like Star Wars,” she said. “Women are just baby factories. We’re pieces of meat. They have no respect, no kindness, no… humanity.” “They raped me,” Diana added, lowering her eyes, saying the words that must have been festering inside her, a great poisonous ball of shame and rage. “They raped me every day. Not one man. Two or three or four. I was a virgin… no one will want me now.” They cried again. They were going to need a lot of tears to wash away all the anger, the suffering. Sophian and Diana were victims. They didn’t need to be de-radicalised. They reviled Islamic State. They wanted Islamic State with its clerics and commanders and boy soldiers wiped from the face of the earth. If counter-terrorist officers understood that, they could learn from these girls. They could teach them how to turn others. They weren’t terrorists. They were potential assets. “We were promised heaven,” Diana said. “It turned into hell.” “Worse than hell,” Sophian added. Diana said: “We thought we could create a new identity, a new reality.” She paused for a second. “We face race hatred every day. In London, every time I wear a headscarf on the bus or the Tube, someone will screw up their face at me. Women as much as men.” “But you didn’t want to marry someone chosen by your parents ” I reminded her. Diana lowered her eyes. “That’s the problem for people like me, like us,” she replied. “I don’t belong anywhere, not here, not in Pakistan, not at home.” “Still you want to go back ” Of course. I’m English. I was born in London.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pilot yells were low cockpit","story":"NewsPilot yells were too low in cockpit footage seconds before jet crashes in seaThe co-pilot was heard shouting \"were too low!\" seconds before the Air Niugini Boeing - plane crashed into the Pacic off the coast of Papua New GuineaShareCommentsByLata Yedroudj:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video cockpit-simulation-shows-terrying-moment-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the terrying moment a plane crashed into the Pacic Ocean during a storm as the pilot yelled weaposre too low!

Dozens of other survivors paddled to safety.  Moments before the plan sunk into the waters, the co-pilot was heard shouting to the captain: Too low! Weaposre too low! Weaposre too low! Seconds later, the footage cuts off as the plane appears to have ed several feet into the Pacic Ocean. Crash investigators noted the pilots had ignored many pull up warning signs and warning lights as they prepared to land, according to a Papua New Guinea Accident Investigation Commission .  The report stated: The crew were fixated on the task of landing the aircraft and did not notice the visual PULL UP caution alert at the bottom of their PFD. Therefore, theydid not take any positive action to arrest the high rate of descent and avoid landing in the lagoon. In fact, neither of the pilots were aware of the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. The investigation found that the crew had received similar aural alerts on previous approaches in visual conditions where the aircraft was safely landed. This would have contributed to the perception that the alerts during the accident approach were nuisance alerts, and therefore disregarded them.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Once we got the racing underway everything flowed along very well indeed and there was some fantastic racing for all to watch.#He added: #Everyone connected with the club had an absolute awesome weekend at Kilmartin, and the place was buzzing.#It was especially great to see such a large number of spectators who made the effort to come along to watch, and after speaking to a few of them they seemed to have enjoyed themselves as much as we did .#Special mention and thanks must go to Jonathan McLeod who was the driving force behind this event, and without his enthusiasm and effort this would not have happened.#We also need to thank the three unsung local workers Ronnie, Jamie and Johnny ,who along with Jonathan all put a tremendous amount of work into the track over the last couple of weeks, cutting down all the bracken by hand on the hill areas, cutting grass and all round general work to ensure this race meet went ahead.#Ricky Caldwell concluded: #The riders are excited about coming back next year # so watch this space.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column july 5 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMid Argyll Pipe Band followed up success at the Helensburgh competition with a victory in the European Championships.The band#s success is the result of years of hard work and good tuition.Grade  European winner Inveraray and District Pipe Band has more of an international feel to it these days, much like a premier league football team.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund. They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors. Every Friday afternoon volunteers will take veg fruit leftover to The Allotment where locals can buy the freshly picked, organic produce.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

economic benefit for local businesses.ldquoWe were lucky with the weather and the use of The Renaissance course minimising local traffic disruption.ldquoThe credit for the smooth running of the event must go to our council officers and the event organisers.Mr Findlay added: ldquoIt was a great event for East Lothian and showcases Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast, which is now the premier golfing location

councillor noted that a number of businesses were very quiet during the tournament but acknowledged that the success of the competition could leave a positive long-term impact.She said: ldquoYou have to look at both sides and that is definitely my stance.ldquoIn the shorter term, people have bills and rent to pay and are running businesses.ldquoIt is alright for tourism and economic development to say the long-term impact will pay off in East Lothian.Businesses painted a mixed picture when it came to the impact of the tournament.Chris Hansen, owner of The Open Arms in Dirleton, was among those

The place was maybe a little bit quieter during the day when it was centred on the golf course.ldquoIn general, we were quite lucky with the weather.Gullanersquos Co-op store was also affected by the tournament, with traffic encouraged to avoid the village.Greg Millar, store manager, said: ldquoWe actually did better than what I thought we would but didnrsquot do as well as the business thought we would,that makes sense.ldquoIt could have been a lot betterthe traffic was erted through Gullane.Meanwhile, Tricia Johnstone, of Fenton Barns Farm Shop and Cafe, felt the event had a detrimental impact on their business.She said: ldquoIt damages business more than increases it.ldquoA lot of people just stay away.But Carol Millar, from The Golfers Rest on North Berwick High Street, said the pub was ldquobusy, adding: ldquoOn Friday and Saturday it was absolutely crazy. I donrsquot knowit is because we are called The Golfers Rest but it was quite busy.Tom Drysdale, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, which also covers Dirleton, said the impact in terms of flow of people and traffic through the village was ldquonot very signicant.He said: ldquoI went on Saturday and Sunday and there was a wonderful atmosphere. I think it was a very good thing for the area.ldquoI think it would be fair to say it did not have a major impact on the village of Dirleton itself but, speaking as a community council for the other

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abour how Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10158188.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

and what was the boundary wall of the monastery.ldquoThe river was wider and shallower in those days ndash much more than in the last couple of hundred years, as the walls now surrounding it are articial.ldquoThe main parts of the drain date back to the mid-th-century and are incredibly well preserved.:Paisley Pattern stars in spectacular UK-Indian fashion show at Paisley AbbeyldquoIt goes as least as far as the road in front of Renfrewshire House.ldquoOften these types of drains are in rural areas not urban ones where there will have been pressure on the land above it.ldquoBut considering the amount of buildings on that site over the centuries, the condition of the drain is quite incredible.The Abbey Drain has lain hidden for centuries until it was unexpectedly rediscovered in the th century, and in recent years, it has been periodically opened up for visitors.Bob believes the finds of the past few weeks could help the development of a more permanent attraction opening up a greater degree of public access to the drain.He said: ldquoWhat we have uncovered has helped us see what could be done with any future excavation.ldquoWe now know much more about the medieval ground levels and have a good idea where some of the monastery buildings were.ldquoIdeally there would be more permanent access to the drain at some point in the future and what wersquove uncovered here makes that much more feasible.Renfrewshire Council leader Iain Nicolson said: ldquoWe would be keen to explore any opportunities to build on that by opening up more permanent access to the Abbey Drain at some point in the future.\"The findings of the Big Dig mean we now know more than ever about this incredible feature beneath the town centre.ldquoThe Big Dig was a really great community project which has created a lot of interest in Paisley town centre and its history over the past couple of months.ldquoWe would like to thank our funders for helping make it happen, and all who have been

But we havenrsquot built a diesel campervan in two years.While an all-electric campervan would certainly tick a few ldquogreen boxes, issues such as finding a recharging spot in the middle of nowhere make their practicality tough for even the toughest of camper.Instead, Mr Hayes claims to have pioneered the next best thing ndash the worldrsquos first fully hybrid and ldquotribrid four-wheel-drive fully independent campervans, powered by low-emission petrol engines and a hybrid battery that also powers white appliances.The design removes the need for gas fuel and a V hook-up for power. The result, he says, is a ldquogame-changer. in the modern campervan market ndash and perhaps some peace of mind for the environmentally-conscious camper.ldquoElectric vehicle range isnrsquot there, he says. ldquoThe point with a campervan is you want to get to places where yoursquore quite far away from home. Yoursquore not going to park up and find somewhere to charge your vehicle.ldquoThe hybrid petrol and electric system is designed to use electric around town and, when yoursquore out on the road, you use petrol.ldquoItrsquos self-charging ndash so when yoursquore driving on the petrol engine, every time you slow down or brake, you recharge the battery.His design for an LPG -fuelled van is even greener, emitting fewer toxic gases than petrol or diesel ndash and itrsquos cheaper.Eco-Campers, which has received backing from Scottish Enterprise, has positioned itself as an innovator in hybrid technologies and has worked hand-in-hand with researchers at leading universities to develop new energy sources and improved hybrid batteries for its vans.Such is demand that the business anticipates seeing its turnover rise by % over the next five years, while there are plans to expand the technology to markets in Canada, Australia and America.However, a boost in green credentials is unlikely to be much comfort to islanders and rural communities struggling to cope with the influx of large vehicles on narrow roads.For Western Isles residents and businesses hoping to squeeze on to ferries, campervans and motorhomes have added to the pressure: while just  took the Ullapool-to-Stornaway ferry in -, an estimated , used it  years later.Over the same period, the figure for Uig to Tarbert in Harris jumped from  to ,, while Oban to Castlebrae rose from  to .The roll-out of the Road Equivalent Tarfin the Western Isles, which has reduced fares, is thought to have encouraged many on to roads.Meanwhile just getting anywhere with your campervan is becoming a challenge in itself: the pick of campsites on key routes regularly display lsquono vacanciesrsquo signs, while earlier this year campervan tickets for the th Tiree Music Festival sold out within  minutes of going on sale.ldquoIn terms of scenery, the Western Isles plays host to some of the most spectacular landscapes and habitats in the world, and it is not surprising that RET has led to a large increase in the number of campervans travelling to the islands to experience this, says Alasdair Allan, MSP.ldquoTourism has taken on an increasing importance to the economy of the islands in recent years, says MSP Alasdair Allan. ldquoFor it to be sustainable, it is vitally important we have the right infrastructure in place and that the effects of tourism are not felt to be in conflict with island communities.ldquoThat means making sure there are sufficient waste disposal units, enough parking berths and available advice for driving on island roads.ldquoIt also means finding ways to ensure islanders donrsquot suffer as a result of the large demand for deck spaces on ferries.ldquoTo this end, I very much welcome the recent moves by the Scottish Government in looking to pilot a scheme that would keep some car space held back for islanders who need to travel at short notice."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-vows-remain-loyal-successor-prime-minister","story":"The PM said she would do ldquoeverything I can to ensure there is a Conservative government, and confirmed that she had voted in the final round of the Tory leadership contest.Frontrunner Mr Johnson is widely predicted to beat Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt to be announced as the next party leader on Tuesday, and Mrs May will stand down the following day.Here is tomorrows @Daily_Express #frontpage:ndash British oil tankers seized by #Iran as tensions risendash EXCLUSIVE: @theresa_may gives her final Number  interview ndash says #Tories must unite to deliver #Brexit #TomorrowsPapersToday pic APKHjkRAmdash July , In an interview with the , Mrs May was asked whether she would remain loyal to her successor.She replied: ldquoAbsolutely.

progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\"

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmA community choir group of all abilities gathered, this morning, in front of St Magnus Cathedral to launch OIC#s new Learning Disabilities Strategy.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

Later, her crew will be presented with a specially commissioned plaque by Orkney Islands Council, marking the visit.Orkney Islands Council’s head of marine services, engineering and transport, and harbour master, Brian Archibald, said: “We’re proud to have been selected as the first alongside port of call on such a prestigious voyage. We hope it will be the first of many happy visits to Orkney for the ship and we look forward to giving her crew and passengers an outstanding Orkney welcome on Sunday.”• Keep an eye on The Orcadian Facebook page on Sunday for coverage, with a feature also due to be published in the Marine Scene section of the paper next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

NorthLink Ferries’ two freight vessels, Helliar and Hildasay, were instrumental in the product development and field testing.Ian Livingstone, managing director of Ankaa, said: “The maritime community has always been challenged with effectively managing, sharing and ensuring validity of seafarer’s data. This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations. Usually this is for the benefit of our customers.

Worn-out markings can make it dficult for road users to distinguish whether it is safe to overtake, parking is allowed or how wide a lane is.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ldquoRoad markings play a vital role in keeping everyone who is using the road safe, so making sure theyrsquore up to standard is imperative.RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ldquoThe use of AI is novel, but there is a danger that this activity will simply confirm what many drivers already know ndash that in many cases lane markings have worn away, causing confusion for all road users.ldquoMarkings are vital in helping everyone use roads safely and properly.

The first pot of investment ndash worth nearly pound million ndash will be available over the next two years for works such as strengthening bridges or repairing potholes.A further pound million will go towards council projects designed to tackle traffic pinch points.The DfT said the announcement follows pound. billion of investment in local road maintenance in the last five years.Martin Tett, the Local Government Associationrsquos transport spokesman, said: ldquoIt is good that the Department for Transport is to invest much-needed funding into improving local roads.ldquoHowever, only long-term investment in local road maintenance can allow councils to deliver the widespread and sustainable improvement of our roads that is needed, to the benefit of all road users up and down the country.ldquoIt is not right that the Government spends  times more per mile on maintaining our national roads ndash which make up just % of all roads ndash than on local roads, which are controlled by councils and make up % of Englandrsquos road network.copy -.

It’s a definite maybe from the First Minister!Notwithstanding his attempt to eat his words, he had been caught off guard, and had said what a growing number of people believe to be true: independence is a question of when, not .Since the European referendum in , people across Wales have seen the Westminster parties tie themselves in knots over what version of Brexit they want to push through.: Gordon Brown launches think tank with warning Boris Johnson could end Union: Benelux could be model for Scotland, Wales and England after independence, says Plaid Cymru leaderThis chaos has been a plague on the houses of both Labour and the Tories, and more and more people are looking on in horror, questioning whether this really is as good as it gets.But of course, the truth is this didn’t start in June . It started long before then, with a depressing democratic deficit which sees the interests of both Wales and Scotland side-lined.That the interests of the peoples of our two nations, and indeed the wills of our respective parliaments, can be ignored in favour of Westminster’s own interests is no new phenomenon.It is, sadly, a part of le in this United Kingdom.Indeed, it was the democratic deficit itself which drove Brexit itself. The result of the first European referendum was, in my view, the wrong answer to the right question. The question being: why are our voices not being heard by the powers that be What the past three years have shown is that the land of milk and honey promised by the leaders of the Leave campaign was never possible. Indeed, any version of Brexit would wreak unimaginable damage on Wales and Scotland, risking thousands of jobs and crucial investment in our communities.That risk increases exponentially when the next British Prime Minister takes office next week. If, as expected, Boris Johnson does indeed become Prime Minister, the occupant of  Downing Street will be a man who relishes the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.He is a man who has talked openly about cutting Scottish spending and seizing control of regional economic policy – rather than allowing spending decisions affecting Wales and Scotland to be made in our respective countries.Let us be in no doubt that these are very serious times which require all of us to think very seriously and soberly about the kind of future we want for our nations.The choice we face has rarely been starker. On the one hand, the insular, narrow nationalism of the British establishment and its obsession with delivering a nightmare Brexit come hell or high water. And on the other, a bright, prosperous future as independent nations at the heart of Europe.I know what I would prefer.More and more people are realising the sad truth that the current set up of the United Kingdom is incapable of serving either of our nations well.One such person is, of course, the de facto Deputy Prime Minister David Lidington, who penned a memo which said that Wales feels “failed” by Westminster. Indeed, he said that “we cannot be complacent about Wales’s attitude to the Union and independence”.His answer  To improve the “branding” on the few projects in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that are funded by the UK Government.He sees that Westminster has failed us. He sees the series of infrastructure projects cancelled. He sees the fiscal gap. And yet he fails to do anything to remedy the situation.His shallow response exposes the contempt in which the British establishment holds our two nations. ‘Slap a union flag on it,’ he might as well have said, ‘that’ll pacy them’.Post-independence, our closest friends and allies will always be the other nations of the former UK, but let us not be fooled into thinking that the UK as it stands is a partnership of equals. It isn’t.In a speech in Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago, I proposed that the independent nations of Wales, Scotland and England adopt a model of cooperation based on the Benelux countries.That would be a kind of post-independence union – a voluntary association of sovereign nations, sitting above each independent nation. It could include shared institutions such as a parliament, council of ministers, and court, all in addition to the respective national institutions.Such a model would foster a more equal and congenial partnership between our nations than could ever be possible within the United Kingdom.When Wales and Scotland do choose an independent future – and it is only a matter of when – I also happen to believe England would benefit from an equal partnership as much as our two countries.This ongoing Brexit psychodrama has put the UK on hold: standing still, rudderless, without effective government. It is fraying, not just at the edges, but right through its body politic. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is moving on.This won’t go on much longer. People can only take so much before they choose a dferent, better path. For both our countries, that path can only lead to one future: independence.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells.

Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The golf course is in wonderful condition thanks to Graeme Beatt and his staff and this tournament is going to do us all proud I think. Of course theres expectation and pressure but everyones here to wish me well. Its not like an intimidating atmosphere - people want me to perform and do my best - so Ill try and use that energy. Its a bit like the Ryder Cup in many ways, in that people are pulling for you. I got on that first tee on Tuesday and it felt like that there was , people there. I was nervous then so I can only imagine what itll be like on Thursday. And the -year-old hinted that he would like to see more traditional north coast weather to really test the worlds best golfers. We need a little something, he said. Four days of weather like weve had to date and this place will get torn apart like any links course would. Theyre built for the wind and the weather. The th at The Open championship is my favourite walk in the world - to do it at Portrush late on Sunday, thered be nothing like it. Ill have to play well and well see what happens.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime. There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts.

Derry is already not just a walled city but a world city.A Derry university freed from the shackles of UU would attract students and academic talent from around the world.Pleading for a medical school in terms which suggest that that’s all we want falls far short of what’s needed. We need transformation. That’s not going to happen without a stronger, bigger, more determined movement for change.UU shted , students from Jordanstown into overcrowded Belfast - without any consideration of transferring some of the departments concerned to Derry.In fact, Derry wasn’t even considered.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city. This has to happen.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"john dunne appreciation life one natures gentlemen","story":"When John Dunne passed away almost three months ago on May , with him went one of the last remaining links to the original staff of St Joseph’s Boys School in Creggan.In recent years John was an utterly familiar sight on the edge of the city’s Bogside as he made his way into town. But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances. It will be an emotional day for us all. It’s not just about me, there were many hundreds of families with stories to tell but maybe I told mine a bit more forcefully.”In the coming days a crane will lt the one-third scale replica of a Nissan hut into place which were originally constructed out of iron welded together and covered in corrugated tin sheets.In , over  residents from the camp marched on the city’s Guildhall to lodge their complaints about their living conditions with the leaders of the old Londonderry Corporation as part of a long running battle with the former local authority.Willie Deery continued: “There is a famous Derry Journal photograph from November  when women from the camp marched on the Guildhall in protest after a fire. The mother’s in that picture are all gone but we are going to recreate that photo with their daughter’s standing in the same formation as the original picture.”CAPTION: An artists impression of what the monument to Springtown camp will look like after its installed."},{"url":null,"title":"statistics reveal missed targets department concedes ambulance service currently resourced","story":"The department of health has conceded that the current level of demand on the ambulance service exceeds available resources.The ambulance service has been dealing with a surge in emergency calls over recent years.Newly published Department of Healthstatistics reveal that between   and  , the number of emergency calls received by the NIAS increased by , from , to ,.In   the Western Local Commissioning Groupalone, which takes in Derry, received , calls – almost  a day.Aside from the Belfast LCG, the ambulance service in the Western area received the highest number of calls in the past year based on per ,-population.Category A calls are immediately le threatening and receive the NIAS’s highest priority with a performance target of arriving at .% of these calls within  minutes.During the last five years in NI, the percentage of Category A calls responded to within  minutesdecreased from .% in   to .% in  In   all LCGs fell well below this target, with the Western Trust the second-best performer at just .%.From December  to March  the performance across Northern Ireland has deteriorated.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

And overseeing the whole operation is Royal Portrush member Richard Beggs.The -year-old, a PE teacher at Coleraine Grammar, says he was “volunteered for the role” as he has “a captive market” of young people..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button As the environmental convenor, Richard and his team are charged with keeping the course and walkways litter-free – something he says has been going well so far.“We knew the tsunami of people that was coming so we were pretty much prepared for it. But to be honest people have been remarkably responsible with their litter,” he said. “I think the RA’s initiative of having refillable cups and water points dotted around the course rather than plastic water bottles has made a big dference.”Richard, a member of Royal Portrush for  years, is delighted the biggest tournament in golf is back in his home town.“You just look around and you really have to pinch yourself. You walk around and see Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Jordan Speith, Tiger and guys you only ever see on TV who would normally never be here, it is just phenomenal. There is just a massive feeling of pride in what everybody’s done to bring it here,” he said.“This is massive for Portrush. You just have to look at the town and the money that has been spent sprucing it up, the new train station, even the pavements. The economic benefits are going to be huge. It is a real shot in the arm for the area and the whole of Northern Ireland.”First ever Legenderry Streetfood Festival set to openPet detective unit investigate missing Lavant cat Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingTributes paid to Northern Ireland road racer Darren Keys following fatal crash at WalderstownThe Twelfth  -

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
