Twenty-five years later, William Hazlitt, who was also in residence at the time, still remembered his first sight of the future poet laureate, a tall “Don Quixote-like” figure, quaintly dressed in a brown fustian jacket and striped pantaloons. There was, wrote Hazlitt, “a roll in his gait” and a “fire in his eye” when he began to talk, he heard in Wordsworth’s voice “a strong tincture of the northern burr, like the crust on wine”. The poet “instantly began to make havoc” of a Cheshire cheese that was on Coleridge’s table.The year 1798 was a miraculous one for Coleridge and Wordsworth, their glorious bromance as yet unpolluted by jealousy and opium (Coleridge), pomposity and indiscretion (Wordsworth). There, on the edge of the Quantocks – they were not yet the Lakeland Poets – Wordsworth wrote Tintern Abbey and Coleridge Kubla Khan and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Striding out in the countryside, accompanied by Wordsworth’s sister, Dorothy, they talked of Shakespeare and Spinoza, their brains, like their lungs, expanding with every stride. The atmosphere, all poetry and high-mindedness, was exciting, even febrile. But Britain was also at war with France, and young men of odd appearance and grand ideas were apt to attract attention. Word of their activities having reached the wrong ears, a government spy was dispatched to observe them. What this emissary made of Wordsworth’s striped pantaloons is, alas, not known.In his marvellous new biography of Wordsworth, it’s as if Jonathan Bate has inhaled the very air these two young men breathed there is a giddiness here – a passionate enthusiasm – that’s all too rare in books about poets, particularly those who, having failed to die young, grew stodgy in later life. In an exhilarating preface, Bate sets out his stall: his book will be shorter than most biographies of Wordsworth, and rather than aiming for comprehensiveness – not for him the dreary opening chapter in which the writer lingers in a graveyard, spouting ancestors – he will seek to explain “the distinctive qualities of the subject’s imaginative power”. What this means, in effect, is that once Wordsworth’s talent fizzles – a process for which the seeds were sown in 1806, when his relationship with Coleridge first ran into trouble, and continued until his death at the age of 80 in 1850 – he, too, will wind down only a quarter of Radical Wordsworth’s pages are devoted to Wordsworth’s last decades. But even with the early life, he’s wildly selective. This is a narrative that celebrates the fact that our lives are marked by turning points, not routine: the “spots of time” of which Wordsworth wrote in his masterpiece, The Prelude.There are a few inconsequential (if delightful) details among the pages of Radical Wordsworth: before his finals at Cambridge, for instance, the poet preferred to read Samuel Richardson’s salacious novel Clarissa than to swot. But in the main, Bate focuses on the major, not the minor. Wordsworth’s was a death-shadowed life – his parents were gone before he was 13 – and perhaps it was this, a heart cracked young, that enabled him to turn relatively easily away from Annette Vallon, the woman he fell in love with in revolutionary France in 1792, and with whom he had a daughter, Anne-Caroline (the war with France hardly explains it, particularly given that she was a royalist who would have been safer in England). Did he see friends guillotined in Paris? Bate speculates that he did – and perhaps this played a part in his later Conservatism (in 1818, John Keats was disappointed to find, on arriving at Rydal Mount, Wordsworth’s home near Ambleside, that his hero was out campaigning for the Tories). Fanaticism, like bereavement, freezes certain internal organs.Bate sees Coleridge’s friendship as crucial to the period of Wordsworth’s greatest creativity – this, and his celibacy between the age of 22 (post-Vallon) and 32 (when he married Mary Hutchinson). His reading of Wordsworth’s life is Freudian – the poet’s sexual frustration was surely sublimated into his verse – but he also notes that Wordsworth anticipated Freud by writing the first fully autobiographical poem in English, in the form of The Prelude: a work, published posthumously, that sighs and thrums with what Freud (after Romain Rolland, a professor of music at the Sorbonne) called “oceanic feeling” a powerful sense of the eternal. For Freud, such spirituality is the attempt of the unconscious to recover that time in our lives – our childhood – when there was no separation between the self and the world: a time when, as Wordsworth put it, all “seemed apparelled in celestial light”.This notion, for me, has to do with awe, and though the worst of Wordsworth’s poems make one’s jaw drop with scorn rather than wonderment (think of The Thorn, in which the poet helpfully offers, like some half-arsed estate agent, the precise measurements of “a little muddy pond”), this is what The Prelude stirs in the reader: first recognition, and then reverence, a racing sense that the numinous is all around. Wordsworth’s relationship with Dorothy was uncommonly intense, the result of their having been separated as children on the night before his marriage, she wore Mary’s wedding ring to bed. She was more than his great companion, housekeeper and amanuensis. Her ability so precisely to record the natural world was a gift she willingly gave to him he’d no need to appropriate.But to her exactitude her brother adds, at his finest, something that’s almost impossible to describe: a prayerfulness that stops the heart, whether you believe in God or not. In these days of seclusion, when we loiter indoors, grey-skinned and melancholy, The Prelude is just what some of us need – and it’s for this, above all, that I want to thank Bate now. After I finished his inspiriting, fleet-footed book, in which he embroiders together life, poetry and landscape with such dexterity, I pulled down my old university copy from the shelf. It might have been a bag of pasta, so greedily did I fall on it.• Radical Wordsworth: The Poet Who Changed the World by Jonathan Bate is published by William Collins (£25)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/956ea83ef33e13447701f12597a27dcccdb9fc67/124_0_2122_1274/master/2122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b34f57b67cc5c71fcef1aa67c44f6304","title":"how coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system","story":"The crisis has brought the economy to a near halt, and left millions of people out of work. But thanks to intervention on an unprecedented scale, a full-scale meltdown has been averted – for now. By  Adam ToozeIn the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world’s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations – known in the new slang of March 2020 as “Rona rigs” – screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been wiped off the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. It is not only Europe and the US that have been shut down, but once-booming emerging market economies in Asia. Commodity exporters from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa face collapsing markets.It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. From the street hawkers of Delhi to the personal trainers of LA, the service sector – by far the most important employer in the modern economy – has been poleaxed. Never before has the global economy suffered a shock of this scale all at once. In the US alone, at least 17 million people have lost their jobs in the last three weeks. A severe global recession is now inevitable.The crucial question is how much of the world economy will survive the lockdown, and this depends on the availability of credit. Business runs on credit. The bits of the economy that do continue to function – the warehouses, the mobile phone providers and internet firms – all need credit. Wage bills for those still working are financed through credit. Even greater is the need of those who are not working. If they can’t get loans, bills will go unpaid, which spreads the pain. To survive the lockdown, millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit, too. Across the world we are witnessing the largest surge in deficits and government debt since the second world war.But who do we borrow from? Banks, financial markets and money markets provide the financial fuel of the world economy. Normally, credit is sustained by the optimistic promise of growth. When that dissolves, you face a self-reinforcing cycle of collapsing confidence, contracting credit, unemployment and bankruptcy, which spreads a poison cloud of pessimism. Like an epidemic, if left uncontrolled, it will sweep all before it, destroying first the financially fragile and then much else besides. It is not for nothing that we speak of financial contagion.What began with the lockdown in Wuhan in January is more intense and more fast-moving than any recession we have seen before. In a matter of weeks we have been confronted with an economic outlook that is as grim as at any moment since the 1930s. But it could have been even worse. Imagine a situation in which, on top of the pain of the lockdown and the hellish scenes in hospital wards, we also face calls for austerity because the government cannot safely finance extra spending. Imagine that interest rates were surging, and the terms for credit cards, car loans and mortgages were suddenly getting stiffer. All of this may still happen. It is already happening to the weaker economies around the world. But for now at least, it has not happened in Europe and the US – even after the turbulence of March 2020, when the pandemic hit with full force.What Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. Without that, large parts of their economies would not be on life support – they would be stone dead. And our governments would be struggling with a financial crunch to boot. Maintaining the flow of credit has been the precondition for sustaining the lockdown. It is the precondition for a concerted public health response to the pandemic.During major crises, we are reminded of the fact that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. When financial markets are functioning normally, it remains in the background. But when they threaten to break down, it has the option of stepping forward to act as a lender of last resort. It can make loans, or it can buy assets from banks, funds or other businesses that are desperate for cash. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited. That means it can decide who sinks and who swims. We learned this in 2008. But 2020 has driven home the point as never before.The last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. The results have been momentous. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system. We may never know what went on behind the closed doors of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England during those critical moments in March. So far, only muffled sounds of argument have reached the outside. But as the virus struck, the men and women in those three central banks held the economic survival of hundreds of millions of people and the fate of nations in their hands. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.The financial markets scan the world for risk. Even the slightest disruption in the vast networks of finance, production and trade offers the opportunity for profit or the threat of loss. So the news on 23 January, that the outbreak of an unknown virus was serious enough for the Chinese authorities to impose a gigantic quarantine, hit the traders on their Bloomberg terminals hard. Bank economists struggled to get a grip on the dimensions of the problem. Would this be a minor disruption like Sars in 2003? Or were we facing the nightmare scenario of the Hollywood film Contagion?In late January, investors began to move more and more money out of things like commodities and shares in companies, and into the relative safety of government bonds. What comforted them was the idea that the virus was a problem contained in China. The day that illusion burst – the day that investors realised that Covid-19 was becoming a global pandemic – was Monday 24 February. Over the weekend the Italian government had announced that it was imposing a quarantine in parts of northern Italy. It was the first place in the west to do so.Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, Italy’s economy had been stagnating. Both its banks and its public finances were in a precarious state. Italy’s debt levels were high enough to cause bond markets to periodically panic. Now the country would become the frontline in the virus fight. The coronavirus would test the solidarity of the eurozone at its weakest link.By early March, whatever complacency had prevailed was long gone. The death toll in northern Italy was rising into the hundreds and it was only a matter of time before the government in Rome would be forced to declare a nationwide lockdown.Investors around the world started to panic. In times of uncertainty, they want safe-haven assets. What makes a government bond a safe investment is not only the financial standing of the borrower, but the depth of the market in which lenders can sell them if they want to get their money back sooner. There is no deeper market than that for US Treasuries, as US government bonds are known. The greater the demand for safety, the lower the interest rate the US government generally has to pay to borrow. In the first week of March, those rates were at record lows.For the rest of the world economy, this run to safety was an alarming signal. One sector that knew it was heading for trouble was oil. When the global economy slows, so does the demand for energy. The oil industry of the 21st century consists, on the one hand, of large, state-controlled producers – above all the Opec group dominated by Saudi Arabia and Russia – and, on the other hand, of the US’s upstart fracking industry. To match falling demand for oil, the Saudis wanted to cut overall production and thus prop up the price. For this they needed the agreement of the other big producers, but Russia refused to go along with them. As Moscow saw it, cutting production with a view to propping up prices was an invitation to American shale producers to fill the gap. If the politics of climate change meant that the future really would bring a transition away from fossil fuel, winning the end game involved seizing as much of the market as possible for as long as oil was being pumped. So Russia decided not to cut production, but to launch a price war. Not wanting to be outdone, over the weekend of 7-8 March, Saudi Arabia took up the challenge. It announced that it would be maximising production and discounting its prices.When trading opened on Wall Street that morning, the situation was so dire that the circuit-breakers – automatic stops to trading that are triggered when prices fall by a certain amount – were soon activated. This was supposed to slow a wild selloff. But it sent a message of panic. As soon as trading resumed, everything sold.A rout like the one that began on 9 March has a perverse logic. When fund managers face withdrawals from the people whose money they manage, they need cash and have to choose which assets to sell first. They might prefer to sell the riskiest investments, but those can be disposed of only for a large loss. So instead, they attempt to sell their most liquid and safe assets – government bonds. That means the prices of those bonds fall, dragging them into the maelstrom. This has the knock-on effect of unravelling a basic relationship on which many investors rely: typically, when shares go down, bonds go up, and vice versa. So to protect yourself against risk, you buy a portfolio made up of both. If everything works as it’s supposed to, the swings should balance each other out. But in the panic that began on 9 March, this was no longer happening: rather than balancing out, the price of shares and bonds were collapsing together. The only thing that anyone wanted to hold was cash, and what they wanted most of all were dollars. The surging US dollar in turn spread the pressure worldwide to everyone who owed money in that currency.The Fed had desperately tried to halt the run. To signal its willingness to support the economy and ease the pressure on the world economy from the strong dollar, it had brought forward an interest rate cut that had been expected for the middle of the month. But with the darkening horizon, lower interest rates did little to help. Who would borrow or invest under such circumstances? Confidence was broken. Just how badly would become clear over the following two weeks.It was a cruel twist of fate that Italy was the first European country struck by the virus. Italy has a sophisticated medical system Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, is among the richest places in the world. The weakness lies in the country’s public finances. To fight the crisis, Italy needed to be spending money on public health and to support the economy during the lockdown. But would the corset of the euro give it the leeway?To ensure that investors stay calm, it is the job of central banks to act as the buyer of last resort. But because Italy is a member of the eurozone, it no longer has an independent national central bank that can buy its debt. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is prohibited from directly buying a member country’s newly issued debt. That left the Italians exposed. As the coronavirus crisis intensified in late February and investors became concerned by the prospect of greater state spending, the spread to German interest rates increased. If they rose too far, Italy would face not only a public health disaster but a financial crisis, too. What could Europe do to help?Italy already had reason to feel abandoned by its European partners: they had done little to help it tackle its chronic unemployment problem, or to take in the refugees arriving from north Africa. The coronavirus was a new test. The signs were not good: other member states were grudging in their reaction to Italy’s appeals for help. But what really mattered, for the country’s financial survival, was the stance taken by the ECB.Under its former president, Mario Draghi, the ECB had emerged in the course of the last financial crisis as the pivot of the European economy. Draghi’s promise to do whatever it takes to hold the eurozone together, uttered at the height of the crisis in July 2012, has become a mantra of modern economic policy. Faced with a financial panic, restoring confidence is key – and because a central bank is in charge of issuing currency, it is the only crisis-fighter with truly unlimited firepower.Northern European fiscal and monetary conservatives had always been suspicious of Draghi’s interventions, which they saw as a way to transfer Italy’s liabilities on to Europe’s balance sheet. And his final round of bond-buying, in 2019, proved particularly controversial. By the time he ended his stint at the ECB that autumn, it was all Angela Merkel’s government in Berlin could do to ensure that there were no unseemly scenes at his retirement party.Christine Lagarde, the former finance minister of France and IMF boss, took over as head of the ECB in October 2019, and inherited Draghi’s extraordinarily difficult position. Now she would have to demonstrate that she could handle a major financial crisis. The ECB press conference on 12 March was the crucial test.The ECB had good news for Europe’s banks: they would receive a huge amount of low-cost funding. It was also going to buy an additional €120bn in assets – although if that was spread across the members of the Eurozone, as the rules demanded, it would hardly give Italy the support it needed. But the critical moment came when Lagarde was asked a question about the ECB’s attitude to sovereign debt. Her response was remarkable. “We are not here to close spreads,” she said. “This is not the function or the mission of the ECB. There are other tools for that, and there are other actors to actually deal with those issues.”“Spreads” meant Italy. And what Lagarde seemed to be saying was that it was somebody else’s problem. But if the ECB wasn’t going to help Italy, who would? Did it really expect the other member states of the eurozone to string together a fiscal safety net for Italy? Obviously, given the bad blood between Italy and the northern Europeans, Lagarde had to walk a fine line. But with hundreds of people dying every day, with global financial markets in a state of repressed panic, was the ECB seriously suggesting that it would wait for Berlin, Paris and Rome to settle their differences before putting out the fire? It was breathtaking.After five terrifying days of market turmoil, the weekend of 14-15 March was a moment for central banks around the world to coordinate their response. What everyone wanted was dollars, so it was above all the Federal Reserve that needed to take the lead. And as its chair, Powell did. He called an unscheduled press conference for the afternoon of 15 March. What he announced was remarkable.With immediate effect, the Fed was cutting interest rates to zero – something it had done just once before, at the height of the crisis in 2008. To stabilise the US Treasury bonds market, it would be buying $700bn in a new round of so-called quantitative easing. And it would start big, buying $80bn by 17 March. In the space of just 48 hours, it would spend more on treasuries than the Fed spent in most months in the aftermath of 2008.These were measures for the US economy. But the coronavirus was a global problem. The flight to safety and the ensuing rise in the dollar had put pressure on everyone who had borrowed in the US currency. So, to ensure that dollars could be piped to every financial institution in every major financial centre in the world, the Fed announced that it was improving the terms on the so-called liquidity swap lines – deals by which the major central banks agree to exchange dollars for sterling, euros, swiss francs and yen in unlimited amounts.The fear in the markets was now feeding on itself. If the Fed’s magic of 2008 no longer worked, then what would?The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded, is the biggest market in the world. And the place where the most transactions are booked is the City of London. On an average day, transactions back and forth total $6.6tn. But on Wednesday 18 March, there was only one trade: people wanted to sell everything. The only thing they wanted to buy were dollars. Every other currency was falling.The central banks’ failure to calm the markets had set the stage for the worst days of the panic. Coronavirus cases were piling up in Europe more rapidly than at the peak of the crisis in Wuhan. Hedge funds were placing multi-billion-dollar bets that the recession in Europe would be protracted. Blue chip companies like Apple were facing stiff premiums to borrow for as little as three months ahead. Even gold, a classic safe haven, was selling.In response, the Bank of England monetary policy committee met the next day in emergency session and announced that the Bank would be buying £200bn in gilts. Unlike in 2008, it would not be doing so on a prearranged schedule. As Bailey explained: “We will act in the markets promptly and rapidly as we see appropriate.” This was no time for timetables. The central bank was, by its own admission, flying by the seat of its pants.On an emergency conference call on the evening of 18 March, the ECB executive board decided that it, too, needed to act. Under a pandemic emergency purchase programme, it announced that it would begin by buying €750bn of government and corporate debt. But the ECB was willing to go even further than that. It said that, if necessary, it would revise some of its “self-imposed limits”.For an institution as hidebound as the ECB, this amounted to a revolution. Self-imposed limits – inflation targets, rules on which European government’s debt it could buy and in what quantities – are what the ECB lives by. It is clear that conservative members of the bank’s governing council continued to resist such a move. But in the end it was the turmoil in the markets that decided the issue. The ECB needed to send a signal of determination. If Lagarde had fluffed her “whatever it takes” moment, the ECB was now at least promising to do whatever was necessary.By the end of the third week of March, 39 central banks around the world, from Mongolia to Trinidad, had lowered interest rates, eased banking regulations and set up special lending facilities. To ease the pressure on emerging markets, the Fed widened the network of liquidity swap lines to cover 14 major economies including Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. This was a remarkable wave of activism. But the pandemic itself was only beginning to bite. Central banks could cushion the financial shock, but not address the actual economic implosion, let alone the health crisis.European governments had been quick to move. Germany had thrown aside its fiscal caution and was committed to a gigantic programme of government guarantees for business lending. But this made all the more glaring the gap to Italy and Spain, which were not only hardest hit by the virus, but also constrained by the financial legacy of the eurozone crisis. They did not want to risk sliding back into a debt crisis.In the US, the Fed had leaped into action. But where were the politicians? Congress was distracted by the upcoming presidential election. What was needed was an unprecedented rescue package for an economy in freefall. How were Republicans and Democrats to reconcile fundamental differences over health care and unemployment insurance, or the notorious cronyism of the president and his clan? Since the Democrats had won control of the House of Representatives in 2018, legislation had been largely paralysed. Now, in the face of a tsunami of job losses, the two parties had to come to an agreement.As trading began in Asia early on the morning of Monday 23 March, the news from Washington made it clear that there had been no deal on Capitol Hill. The futures markets plunged so violently that circuit breakers were activated again – by now this had happened an unprecedented five times in two weeks. If it wanted to avoid a meltdown when Wall Street opened, the Fed would have to make another move.Until this point, Jerome Powell had been moving in the shadow of his predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who had been Fed chair in 2008. But by 23 March, Powell had activated all the basic elements of the 2008 repertoire – slashing interest rates, using quantitative easing, supporting money markets. But it had not worked, partly because it could not reach the source of the crisis itself – that is, the virus and the lockdown – and also because it was not reaching the bit of the credit system that was most vulnerable in 2020: the borrowing by big corporations.The Fed has always steered clear of corporate debt, which it considered politically sensitive. If you bought debt from inidual firms, you were vulnerable to accusations of favouritism. If you bought a cross-section of debt you ended up holding many very poor-quality loans. But by the early hours of 23 March, it was clear that something had to be done to stabilise the corporate debt market. Since 2008, bonds issued by non-financial corporations have surged from $3.3tn to more than $6.5tn. If their value fell too far, US corporations would not only face shutdowns and a complete loss of revenue, but also a crippling credit squeeze.Ideally, the Fed would have made a grand announcement in conjunction with a Congressional stimulus package. But by the evening of 22 March, it was clear that the package being proposed by the Republicans was unacceptable to the Democrats. It might take days for them to square the difference. The financial markets would not wait.On 23 March, 90 minutes before markets opened, Powell made his move. He announced that the Fed was setting up legal entities – off the books of the Fed, but guaranteed by it – that would have the capacity to buy highly rated corporate debt, or at least any debt that the ratings agencies were still willing to declare investment-grade. In effect, the Fed was establishing itself as the backstop to the trillion-dollar corporate bond market. The Fed ramped up its asset-purchase programme, to an astonishing $375bn in Treasury securities and $250bn in mortgage securities in a single week.Two days later, on 25 March, backing arrived from Congress when the Senate passed its giant package of $2tn – more than twice the size of the stimulus bill passed in 2009. It provided funds to top up unemployment insurance, to support small businesses and the US’s privatised hospital system. Crucially, it also set aside $454bn to cover Fed losses. Since most loans would not be expected to go bad, this would enable the Fed to make more than $4tn in loans, if necessary.In the US, the public health campaign against the virus was still a shambles. But as far as economic policy was concerned, the full power of the American state was now being deployed behind the emergency programme. And the Fed was also acting as a provider of dollar liquidity to the world economy. In the UK, too, the Treasury and the Bank of England were working closely to link the huge increase in government spending to efforts to stabilise financial markets.But in the eurozone, that kind of coordination was lacking. The ECB had managed to stop the immediate panic. Yet there was still the question of whether the member states could come up with a financial plan to support their hardest-hit neighbours, Italy and Spain. The obvious solution was to issue debt jointly to fight the crisis together – an idea raised repeatedly during the eurozone crisis, when it had been bitterly resisted by a conservative northern European coalition led by Germany. This would ensure that Italy was not constrained by its pre-existing financial weakness.For a coalition of nine states led by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the case was obvious. On 25 March they called for a “common debt instrument” to fund a crisis response. The ECB threw itself energetically behind the proposal. But, once again, the Netherlands and Germany refused to budge. The issue was shoved off into the Eurogroup, a meeting of the eurozone’s finance ministers, where the outline of a deal did finally emerge two weeks later. By then the immediate panic had passed. As Lagarde and her central banking colleagues had feared from the outset, it was on their shoulders that the stability of the eurozone continued to rest.Why weren’t investors more terrified? Because the scale of Congressional stimulus made clear that, no matter how ided American politics were, that wouldn’t stand in the way of a huge surge of spending. And the Fed, for its part, would make sure that the huge flow of new debt was absorbed, if necessary on to its own accounts. The private credit system, the government budget and the balance sheet of the Fed were welded together in a closed loop.What the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB managed to do in March was prevent the damage caused by the shutdown being made even worse by an immediate collapse of corporate credit. At the same time, by stabilising sovereign debt markets, they have enabled a huge surge in public spending to fight the crisis and cushion its social and economic side effects. To do this they have both widened the safety net to parts of the financial system never before protected, and intervened on a scale far greater even than in 2008.In the final days of March, the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $83bn per day, or just shy of $1m per second. On 9 April, at the same moment as the latest horrifying unemployment numbers were released, it announced another $2.3tn in support targeted specifically at municipal debt and lower-grade corporate debt. That same day, the Bank of England adopted an even more radical approach. Rather than going through the process of having the Treasury issue debt that would then be bought by the central bank, it announced that it would be offering direct monetary finance to the government, to provide it with whatever funding it needed. This would be temporary, but it was still a radical move. The government’s current account at the Bank of England would be repurposed to allow, if necessary, tens of billions of pounds in coronavirus spending. The last time the British government resorted to this mechanism was at the height of the crisis in 2008.What we have seen in the financial system, over the past few weeks, is a victory of sorts – but it is a defensive one. Once again, we are propping up a fragile, profit-driven system to avoid something even worse. It is also a victory limited in scope.By flattening the curve of financial panic, the central banks of advanced economies have managed to ensure that life under the lockdown is not made even more unbearable by the shutting off of credit to business and households. They have also ensured that the public health response to Covid-19 can proceed at any scale that is required. Within Europe, there are questions about the differences between eurozone members: Germany has been able to deliver a conspicuously larger fiscal response to the crisis than have Italy or Spain. But those inequalities pale next to the problems facing much of the rest of the world. There the crucial supply of credit is being cut off even before coronavirus cases begin to mount, meaning, once again we have confirmed that the global financial system is hierarchical. At the apex stands the US Federal Reserve. The ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and their advanced-economy counterparts all enjoy the Fed’s direct support. Thanks in no small part to that support, the advanced-economy central banks enjoy great latitude in propping up their credit systems. They might face moderate movements in their currency’s exchange rate, but no devastating financial squeeze.That is what the emerging-market economies have been suffering since February. Covid-19 is hitting every part of the world economy. The World Bank is warning of a devastating setback to the economies of Nigeria, Angola and South Africa, along with the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Almost half the countries in the world – more than 90 so far – have been forced to apply to the IMF for financial assistance.If flattening the curve in Europe and the US was the battle of March, the next challenge is to reduce the shockwaves radiating out to the rest of the world. The last few weeks have seen a remarkable display of technocratic energy and imagination in western financial centres. That same level of commitment now needs to be brought to bear in supporting the rest of the world. We cannot control the epidemic or restore the world economy without it.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f88f110c847bf171af4f7a1a1f7405ce0ff43347/0_135_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=870220ad4175b29a063ed34153bc9321","title":"stock markets china trade global recession imf forecasts covid 19 business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsCalquence is a blood cancer treatment - it inhibits an enzyme called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) which helps some leukemic cells to survive and proliferate (details here).AZ is now testing whether Calquence could help treat the exaggerated immune response associated with COVID-19 infection in severely ill patients.

This is the fastest launch of any clinical trial in the history of AstraZeneca.” Asia-Pacific stock markets have hit a one-month high, helped by the better-than-expected trade data from China. Analysts said some of the tail risks that had threatened a much deeper and prolonged downturn were starting to dissipate thanks to a slowdown in new coronavirus cases in major economies and a raft of monetary and fiscal stimulus globally.“Looking ahead, production constraints should no longer be an issue as economic life in China returns,” Oxford Economics said in a note, but added that exports were expected to fall more substantially due to weak global demand.This is better than economists had expected.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank, writes:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.After a refreshing break for Easter, stock markets are resuming their recovery - despite plenty of evidence that the global economy is being dragged into a deep recession by Covid-19.And after its best week in more than a decade, Britain’s FTSE 100 is being called up another 90 points. That would lift the blue-chip index back over 5,900 points for the first time in a month (since the stomach-churning plunge of 12 March).The flood of stimulus packages and emergency liquidity moves from governments and central bankers are cheering investors -- despite a steadily rising death toll in the UK and US.As Kyle Rodda of IG puts it:For markets, it’s a matter of financial conditions over fundamentals at the moment. The Fed’s moves last week to open up its credit lines to a broader range of borrowers, and deepen the amount of credit it extends, has eased credit risk in the market. There’s also some relief that Opec finally agreed to cut production over the weekend - although the deal hasn’t lifted crude prices much.The markets will be reminded today that the world economy is in a terrible mess. The International Monetary Fund kicks off its Spring Meeting - virtually - with some dire new growth forecasts. It latest World Economic Outlook report is expected to show the global economy contracting sharply as lockdown measures hit activity.IMF Kristalina Georgieva set the scene last week, saying the world faces “a crisis like no other”.Morgan Stanley is also preparing for the long haul, predicting that the US economy won’t return to pre-Covid 19 levels until the last quarter of 2021.Recovering from this acute period in the outbreak is just the beginning and not the end. We believe the path to re-opening the economy is going to be long. It will require turning on and off various forms of social distancing and will only come to an end when vaccines are available, in the spring of 2021 at the earliest.The new earnings season kicks off today, with Wall Street banks JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo and consumer goods giant Johnson \u0026amp Johnson reporting results and giving forecasts.

Peace between rival camps is the new leader’s big challengeThe Labour party is in turmoil. It has just elected a new leader, Keir Starmer, who campaigned on the basis of party unity and ending factionalism. There was a sense from this result that members wanted a period of calm. But a deeply controversial internal report was leaked over the weekend to journalists and then distributed on social media. The effect has been to escalate factional warfare and intensify the toxic relationships between different groups within Labour.The report is the result of an internal investigation into the work of Labour’s governance and legal unit in relation to antisemitism. Created by party staff, it pulls together an estimated 10,000 emails, thousands of messages exchanged on work accounts, and the contents of two WhatsApp group chats apparently created by senior management in Labour headquarters. However, it will not be submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission that is currently investigating antisemitism within the party, as party lawyers have reportedly decided that it is not within the scope of the external probe.Some have assumed that the document, dated March 2020 and written by staff working in the era when Jeremy Corbyn was leader and his ally Jennie Formby the general secretary, provides evidence that Labour’s antisemitism problem is fictitious. That is not the conclusion of the report. Instead, its primary claim is that disciplinary cases were indeed poorly handled by the party that this was not a mishandling of antisemitism complaints in particular but of all complaints in general and that the situation has improved under Formby.The parts of the document that have gained most attention are those focused on the “hyper-factional” environment existing within party HQ between Corbyn’s election in 2015 and previous general secretary Iain McNicol’s departure in February 2018, according to the report. It paints a truly horrible picture of an atmosphere dominated by politically motivated cruelty. There will be party members who recognise the nastiness of comments from the heated debates in their own local parties. But the report is shocking because the messages are alleged to come from senior staffers. It says the comments made about colleagues include “total mentalist”, “bitch face cow” and “pube head”, while Diane Abbott is mocked for crying in a toilet. There is also evidence that purports to show a staffer hoping that a named young member with mental health issues “dies in a fire”.The other aspect to the factionalism described in the report, putting aside the vitriol, is the hope apparently expressed by anti-Corbyn staffers that Labour would not be electorally successful. The document contends that those in charge of party operations wanted the Liberal Democrats to win the 2017 Manchester Gorton byelection, created a “secret key seats team” to prioritise general election spending in seats held by MPs on the right of the party even when they were “safe”, and were disappointed when Corbyn’s Labour did better than expected in the 2017 general election. The messages in the report show discussion of a “Trot hunt” during the 2015 leadership election to prevent new party members voting for Corbyn.The rest of the report es into the failings of Labour’s disciplinary system, asserting that the unit “did not properly log complaints”, that there was no record of action being taken on serious cases, and that “well-evidenced” antisemitism complaints were dismissed as “spam”. It also sets out the details of particular cases – controversially so, due to the implications for data protection now that it has been leaked.If the Panorama documentary told one side of the Labour antisemitism story, as Corbynites say that it does, this internal report shows the other side. Its claims will undoubtedly also be questioned. An independent investigation into the contents and release of the report has already been announced by Starmer. What is undeniable is that complaints have been mishandled due to a toxic internal culture, and that this has caused deep hurt – to the Jewish community, and to party members who worked hard for the Labour party with little reward.Less than two weeks into his leadership, Keir Starmer has his work cut out. Difficult decisions that will have repercussions for Labour’s future – from procedural changes in HQ to trying to bring about a fundamental shift in party culture – lie ahead.• Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71163a21b32737e2c6151a31390bcb16ecce951a/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab4a5882cec60f04c62e2244d59755d","title":"people work lockdown herd immunity debate coronavirus","story":"So far we haven’t had the evidence to truly judge leaders and their coronavirus policies. With policies easing, we soon willThe trickle is starting. Spain, Austria, Italy, China, possibly Germany and the US will this week begin, however hesitantly, the great return to work. As others hold back and some may even toughen lockdowns, the result will be the most extraordinary mass experiment in history.The outcome should go some way to settle the central argument of coronavirus policy, of lockdown and suppression v mitigation and herd immunity. It will also condition a later political blame game, who was right and who was wrong.Statistics are in chaos. Death “rates” lag behind deaths. Deaths are confused with “hospital deaths”. Headlines highlight “most cases per nation” or “most deaths per nation”, not deaths per million. Yet we are at the mercy of these statistics. They are the raw material of the modellers, and their models are the sacred entrails into which policymakers peer each day, to see what level of lockdown to impose on their people.Not surprisingly, science is giving way to value judgments. Authoritarian regimes are erging from libertarian ones. Countries in total lockdown (Spain and France) are compared with countries practising social distancing (Sweden and Korea) and those such as Turkey and Brazil which do none of those things. As David McCoy said in the  last week, we simply don’t have models that balance “the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown”.I assume that hard evidence will now start to emerge. There will be a wide comparative spectrum, of outliers and controls. We should learn to what degree were face masks and two-metre separation efficacious, as against mass isolation and economic collapse. So far, such evidence is in desperately short supply. Soon it will be on the ground, in the world’s factories and on its pavements.Economics has taken a terrible battering this last month, because it is thought to put “money before lives”. But all options cost lives, which is why political judgment has moved to centre stage. Businesses are ruined, dreams shattered, people die. As in the conundrum of the swerving driver, do you avoid one death now, but is it at the cost of five down the road?The cliche is true. Only time will tell, but that time starts now. The task is to scrutinise the evidence and let it tell the truth, not just the truth we want it to tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d10265572bf129566bbe046348f730bff82ed504/0_173_4911_2946/master/4911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42fa8fc9625c61493b1c22f55e04859b","title":"the guardian view on poorer nations and covid 19 the g20 must act","story":"Debt relief and massive economic support are needed in Africa, as developing nations cope with health and economic emergencies As some of the world’s richest countries became centres of the coronavirus pandemic, politicians and populations temporarily glimpsed the abyss. By simultaneously attacking citizens’ health and threatening their incomes, the spread of the disease presented an unprecedented challenge to societies in which economic stability was taken for granted. Safety nets had to be reinvented overnight to protect iniduals and businesses during lockdown, while health service capacity was urgently ramped up. In London, Washington, Berlin and Paris, measures costing billions of pounds were rightly signed off by governments with scarcely a second thought.What the developed countries did for their own economies is now desperately required for the poorest nations of the world. As the virus spreads in sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and the Middle East, the same twin threats to life and livelihoods are now faced by heavily indebted states with under-resourced healthcare systems. But the kind of financial stimulus undertaken in the west is an impossibility. Without significant and immediate assistance from the global community, the consequences could be catastrophic.The World Health Organization has warned that Africa may soon face “a huge peak” in coronavirus infections. Yemen, where the health system has been broken by five years of war, announced its first case on Friday. In many of the countries now bracing for the worst, limited access to clean water and cramped communal living conditions will hamper the battle against the virus’s spread. There are acute shortages of testing equipment and ventilators. In locked-down rural economies, food supplies may be jeopardised.The global fall in commodity prices has already hit sub-Saharan Africa hard, slowing exports and depriving countries of vital hard currency. Capital flight to the dollar, as investors seek a safe haven during the crisis, has further exposed fragile economies. As the picture grows ever bleaker, the World Bank has predicted the region’s first recession for 25 years. A study for the UN has estimated that measures taken to combat the pandemic could nullify 30 years of progress in the fight against poverty.This week, G20 finance ministers, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can coordinate the action necessary when they meet for online spring conferences. More than 80 poor and middle-income countries have already written to the IMF seeking urgent financial help. So far, additional loans have been made available to governments desperately needing to boost healthcare capacity.Far more is needed. There must be a moratorium on debt repayments from poorer nations to lender countries, multilateral institutions and private creditors (around $44bn is due from Africa alone). This money must stay where it will be needed to provide income support and save lives. Even more importantly, the IMF should be given the funds to finance health spending and an economic stimulus on the vast scale that will be required. The IMF estimated last month that the financing needs of distressed emerging economies will be at least $2.5tn. Its member states should agree to allow the fund to make money available through additional special drawing rights, the mechanism devised after the 2008 crash to boost international liquidity.As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, there has thus far been a lamentable absence of global leadership. History will judge the more prosperous nations harshly if they fail to act decisively to help the world’s poor in this hour of need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45d5f7afbae490defc39ae3fd24c51f37ba57ef2/0_135_965_579/master/965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1a7d317c1ce5f4499287b77451339f","title":"the great british art quiz set by dulwich picture gallery london","story":"Museums and galleries across the UK are closed due to coronavirus – so explore their collections with a few tricky questions in this daily brain-teaserThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

Every corner of society is exposed each one of us battling our own problems. For headteachers in England, those problems are multiplied by the anxieties of the 8.7 million children for whom they are responsible.The past month has been brutal for school leaders, and we all need to act cautiously if we don’t want thousands of teachers to be yet another casualty of this virus.It took just nine minutes for the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to change everything. In less time than it takes to hard-boil an egg, Williamson last month told parliament that schools would “close until further notice”, that national exams were cancelled, that schools would continue caring for vulnerable children, and children of keyworkers – even during the Easter holidays – and that all pupils on free meals would continue to be fed.Headteachers went from running an ordinary school to organising a virtual school, a childcare centre and a food delivery service. They had two days to turn it around. Education was never the sole focus of schools, and it’s a shame it has taken a pandemic to prove it.Ten years ago, heads may have found it easier. Under Labour, education was managed by a large and well-funded Department for Children, Schools and Families – a title the Conservatives mocked for its length, and which some, such as the then education secretary, Michael Gove, disliked because it suggested schools should focus on child welfare. He wanted to get back to concentrating on discipline and academic rigour, the sort of words that get booming rounds of applause from rightwing audiences.Hence, Gove’s first act on becoming education secretary, was to change the name back to the Department for Education, and then to set fire to almost every initiative related to children’s wellbeing.For a decade, headteachers have felt every budget cut to children’s services, and endured every slice to the cash pot for psychologists, nurses, or a school police officer. They have felt every hour they have had to spend coordinating help for a child after Children’s Trusts were disbanded. “Don’t worry,” they were told, “it’s not your job.”Except, of course, it was. Cancel schools, and look: who is there for children with protection orders? Who is feeding the vulnerable? Who is writing mass bereavement policies to explain to year 4 why their teacher isn’t coming back? Who is (virtually) sitting with the sobbing kid whose GCSEs have been cancelled?Teachers. Gove may have taken the words “families” off the wall and decimated budgets, leaving little in the pot for welfare, but schools never gave up on helping. In families’ hour of most desperate need – when the government failed to quickly deliver its national food voucher scheme, when its promise of online resources was slow and limited – school leaders stepped in to make these things happen.Of course, heads are well-paid professionals with prized job security, and 12 million parents have now taken on the burden of home-schooling alongside trying to keep or find a job. Amid these difficulties, the wellbeing of school leaders is no one’s main concern. But survey data shows a third of heads are working longer hours than before (they already did 60-hour weeks), most are still regularly attending school, and alcohol use is creeping up as a coping mechanism. Let us also remember the average age of a headteacher is 50, meaning many are at higher risk if infected with Covid-19.Talking to school leaders, many are at the edge of their nerves. Some will leave, more will stay – and those who do will likely find a new zeal for fighting back.To get ahead, the government should make two moves. First, it must accept that schools cannot return to a situation where slashed budgets mean leaders scrimp on soap and mental health services are impenetrable. Austerity has had its day.Second, ministers must resist pressures to whimsically bounce schools back into service. Anyone who thinks proper social distancing can be done in a full (or even half full) school has either never met a child, or been in a school. A properly planned and clearly communicated return is the least everyone is owed.Finally, I would implore everyone, parents, governors, the entire public, to go easy on schools. They cannot be perfect at this time. Children will be upset about cancelled exams. Not every school can stay open for Easter. One may have sent home a whizzy digital learning package, another may have sent textbooks and a wish of good luck. When the world changes in nine minutes, it rarely changes equally. No one is having an easy pandemic. Let’s hope it is over soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be20f0fcb446d0d3eaafa6ab7f833f786adf565/0_202_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8236d82918d29ed6d735520706122d79","title":"the schools open during lockdown for some kids its the only safe place","story":"Alternative provision units are exempt from the UK’s Covid-19 closure - but teachers fear for vulnerable pupils as few come to classSeamus Oates was deciding whether to keep his schools for vulnerable and difficult children open during the coronavirus crisis when an email from a teaching assistant dropped into his inbox.“It was a devastating reminder that sometimes school is the only safe place some kids have, the only place they are safe from abuse, the only place they get proper meals. It also reminded me of the misery school holidays can bring. If possible, I hope and pray all the schools remain open.”The message stuck. “That letter influenced our thinking a lot when we were planning for this,” says Oates, chief executive of TBAP, a trust that runs 10 schools around England for children excluded, or in danger of being excluded, from other schools.“When this started, people were saying ‘we need to keep the kids at home’. But we really need to think about where some of these children are being kept. Some are going back to very disadvantaged backgrounds. We’ve stayed open. There will always be a safe space in the locality for these children.”His alternative provision (AP) schools are among 144 AP academies educating children who have been permanently excluded, or are at risk of exclusion, alongside 200 council-run pupil referral units (PRUs). The sector teaches the most vulnerable children, many with backgrounds of domestic violence, sexual abuse, neglect, gangs and county drug lines.But the difficult decisions around keeping schools open has split the sector, not least because of the risk to staff. Wasim Butt, principal of Beachcroft AP academy, in north London, describes how his teachers are putting their clothes in the washing machine as soon as they arrive home for fear of infecting their own children. “Staff are feeling really fragile,” he says.The next day the Department for Education (DfE) issued further guidance, saying schools should remain open to vulnerable children, including those “with safeguarding and welfare needs”, conceivably every child in alternative provision. By 22 March, updated guidance asked “local authorities and schools to maintain provision for children in alternative provision settings wherever possible”, with the “expectation that vulnerable children who have a social worker will attend school”.The erging approaches to school closures may stem from the considerable uncertainty around the extent to which children are playing a role in spreading Covid-19.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.So the schools are being asked to keep their doors open. But here’s the catch: they can’t compel pupils to attend. The result is that teachers are travelling to work, putting themselves at risk, only to find very few children turn up. At Olive AP academy, in Thurrock, Essex, the corridors are empty. The voice of the headteacher, Collette Hunnisett, echoes against walls lined with silent classrooms, where once there were 96 pupils. In one classroom a counsellor waits alone, patiently, surrounded by chairs.Just two pupils, dressed smartly in uniform, are busy in the art room. Michael, in year 9, is sawing wood and Samuel, in year 10, is drawing the Mona Lisa. Seven staff are nearby. “It’s good to have a nice environment where I can talk,” says Samuel. “But if it’s a long time away from my work, that would get worrying. I’m in year 10 and I need to do my GCSEs next year, so I can’t be playing all the time.”If Samuel and Michael’s peers are similarly worried, they haven’t acted on it. “For us it’s a bad thing they’re not here,” says Hunnisett. Quite a few of the children are at risk of being involved in drug-running through county lines, she says. “We have a really strong ethos around safeguarding, and for us not to be able to do that every day is the worst feeling in the world.”Astrid Schön, associate headteacher at London East alternative provision, says that telling AP pupils they are special cases compared with the rest of the country is not straightforward. “If I say to one of my boys in a gang, you should come in, you’re vulnerable and you’re meant to attend, he’s going to look at me like I’m out of my mind, because they don’t see themselves like that.”In Scotland, the children’s commissioner has already warned of low uptake of school places by vulnerable children, partly because of the stigma.Schön also thinks exams cancellation was poorly communicated. “Our kids at the best of times struggle to work and now no one, I can assure you, apart from some of my more diligent girls, is going to do any work.” She describes pupils with four siblings in one-bedroom flats at risk of domestic violence, and those involved with drug dealers, saying she fears a “mini-crimewave”. “We will only know the full impact of this when the figures for young people not in education, employment or training come out next year, ” she says.Butt says schools will have to negotiate “a minefield” when pupils return. “You can’t just pick up where you left off with these children,” he adds.One headteacher, who does not wish to be named, describes a “very anxious girl” who was “drip feeding” disclosures of sexual abuse to a staff member and is no longer at school. Another talks about a young man with “missing episodes”, who had just begun attending school regularly.All 11 AP settings the  spoke to are phoning families and providing learning packs, and the usual escalation routes to social services remain. The Wave multi-academy trust in Cornwall is even trying to provide dongles for pupils without an internet connection.Mark Jordan, chief executive of the Parallel Learning Trust, which has schools in London and Southend, has been inventive in trying to keep his pupils’ education going. “If parents say, ‘we’re self-isolating’, we will say ‘OK, but on day 15 we expect that child to turn up’.”His team is also encouraging pupils to deliver flyers offering to help the elderly. “Developing a sense of community is so important for these kids,” he says.But many AP leaders think public healthcare takes priority. The sector’s representative body, the National Association for PRUs and Alternative Provision (PRUsAP), blames the Department for Education.Its president, Sarah Dove, has sent an open letter to education ministers, accusing them of failing to consult with AP schools and, instead, “insisting on an approach which puts staff and children at risk”. The letter says “social workers are not making home visits and are working from home, whilst PRUs and AP are then expected to do this”.Nonetheless, Hunnisett wants to stay open. “The hard work my staff put in with these pupils can be undone so quickly. The only way I explain it is a huge sense of loss. All I want is for my young people to be here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d3caa1d13e61cd377487dd1c9d8ef14db0ec26/0_0_3024_4032/master/3024.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ccc38e3fb050af38e5bdaca4459a771d 1440w","title":"time running out footballers whose contracts expire on 30 june","story":"From Vertonghen to Cavani, there are a lot of players in Europe who do not know if they will finish the season with their clubsA Premier League best XI in this predicament come 1 July:Ben Foster. The 37-year-old is a consistent shot-stopper and has nine clean sheets from 29 games for Watford this season. Without a player of his calibre, Watford would not have climbed out of the relegation zone.Jan Vertonghen may have not had his best season with Tottenham but he has more than 300 Premier League appearances and a fresh start could inspire a return to his best. At the other end of the spectrum José Mourinho has in Japhet Tanganga another talented centre-back whose contract is due to end. The 21-year-old has been one of the few positives from a difficult period at the club. Tanganga withstood a baptism of fire on debut against Liverpool despite switching from right- to left-back in the second half.At right-back, Nathaniel Clyne has fallen so far down the pecking order at Liverpool, some people still think he is out on loan at Bournemouth, where he made 14 league appearances last season. The former Crystal Palace is still only 29 years old and has 14 England caps to his name, so is not a lost cause for any willing clubs. The cupboard looks a little bare at left-back but Christian Fuchs is a Premier League winner with Leicester. The little playing time the Austrian has had this season and last should mean he has plenty in the tank even at 33.Adam Lallana, Jeff Hendrick and John Lundstram. Lallana has featured only in patches for Liverpool but has shown he can drive his team forward. When called on late by Jürgen Klopp he delivered an equaliser against Manchester United to save the leaders’ unbeaten run in October.Burnley’s once-record signing Hendrick scored a game-saving goal of his own against Brighton and a winner against Everton. After a dip Sean Dyche’s team have impressed with Hendrick a key part of the industry that has led to a five-game unbeaten run, their best this season.Lundstram has shone in his first season in the Premier League with Sheffield United. He was the fall guy after Sander Berge signed for a record fee in January but a return to the starting lineup in United’s final game before the shutdown paid off for Chris Wilder. Lundstram’s delicious cross for Billy Sharp was the creative spark needed to beat Norwich.Ryan Fraser admitted in January he had not “played for the team” at Bournemouth in the first half of the season and the left winger’s form has suffered. With a change of scenery he could bounce back. Fraser managed seven goals and 14 assists last season and the lack of such a contribution has been missed by Eddie Howe.Chelsea’s Willian and Olivier Giroud complete a formidable front three. The Brazilian is one of Frank Lampard’s most consistent players, as is his touch, range of passing and delivery from free-kicks. A match-winning double at Tottenham in December showcased his devastating ability. Giroud has been frustrated by Lampard using him sparingly while Tammy Abraham was injured. Giroud finally got a start against Tottenham in February and link-up play was so good it resulted in a goal for himself in Chelsea’s win. Giroud’s header found Mason Mount, who squared to Ross Barkley and the latter’s shot rebounded for Giroud to lash past Hugo Lloris.Nice’s Walter Benítez is the best goalkeeper available, with Gianluigi Buffon on speed dial should he not sign a new deal with Juventus. The Argentinian kept the most clean sheets in Ligue 1 last season with 16. Benítez will need to be on his toes too as Paris Saint-Germain’s attack-minded trio Thomas Meunier, Tanguy Kouassi and Layvin Kurzawa slot into defence with their experienced teammate Thiago Silva. The 17-year-old Kouassi showed his eye for goal with a pair of headers that helped drag PSG to a 4-4 draw with Amiens in February.In midfield Milan’s Giacomo Bonaventura and Bayer Leverkusen’s Charles Aránguiz flank Borussia Dortmund’s Mario Götze. Götze has declined since he won the World Cup for Germany in 2014 but, if he can stay fit, he has a lot to offer at 27.The front three have an eye-watering 811 league goals between them: Napoli’s Dries Mertens, PSG’s Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are up for grabs, assuming the one-year option is not triggered at Milan on Ibrahimovic’s contract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f43f9b1812284f1026e72af7c43e9d380ee5f3/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=594c86a3b3e29b7b146bb82510bc25c3","title":"coronavirus have i already had covid 19","story":"Covid-19 symptoms, when they occur, vary widely and undertesting means many people have probably been unwittingly infectedCovid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis. Is it possible to find out, and how should you behave if you think you may have been infected? Dr William Hillmann: Antibody tests are being developed but are not in widespread clinical use yet. The antibody testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether somebody has had it. I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available.Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. Loss of smell and taste are also symptoms. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. It’s impossible right now to say what the true prevalence of the disease in the US is since we are still prioritizing testing for people who are sick or in the hospital or who are healthcare workers. We’re not doing widespread testing that South Korea and some European countries have done to get a sense of how many people are asymptomatic or have such minimal symptoms that they attribute it to allergies or something else.When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding.Dr David Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene. I think universal mask-wearing in public is a reasonable recommendation based on what we know about the wide spectrum of symptoms, and the fact that people can be asymptomatic and still be shedding the virus.Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every inidual about what they feel is right. That being said, with the surge in infections that we’re seeing in places like New York, if you were symptomatic at one point but were not tested, and you were in close contact with somebody, I think you should tell them.Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.There have been reports out of China suggesting people are testing positive for Covid-19 a second time. Most scientists think it is an issue around the inaccuracy of the testing and not that people are having two separate cases of the disease.Dr David Buchholz, senior founding medical director, primary care, assistant professor of pediatrics, Columbia University Irving medical centerDr William Hillmann, associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts general hospital"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca47872100e5f7da03447d1b1c6c03fc269e6af6/0_72_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e7ec15af7844e8aa8e31ee842c57e770","title":"were abandoned to our own luck coronavirus menaces brazils favelas","story":"Residents fearful how their families will cope as food runs out and Jair Bolsonaro undermines lockdown messageRenato Rosas knows what poverty feels like. The musician and biomedical salesman grew up in one of Brazil’s biggest favelas, in the Amazon city of Belém. Relatives still live in the wooden stilt houses that line the black, polluted rivers running into Guajará Bay.“It is the most extreme poverty,” he said of the Baixadas da Estrada Nova Jurunas neighbourhood where floods, deadly sucuri snakes lurking in floating rubbish and armed drug gangs are among the challenges.In March, as the coronavirus pandemic began to hit, Brazil’s state governors closed schools, businesses and shops, shutting off the income of favela residents and leaving them with dwindling supplies of food. More than half of Belém’s 1.5 million people live in favelas and children normally fed at school were at home going hungry. “People were in need,” Rosas, 38, said.He and colleagues from the music and education project Farofa Black started raising money for food parcels – known as cesta básica, the basic basket in Brazil – to deliver around the community.“When we stop at one of these places people come running. It is very fast, it all runs out very quickly,” he said.Scenes like these are being repeated across Brazil, where nearly 14 million people live in densely populated favelas in this deeply unequal country. As of Thursday, Brazil had 22,169 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 1,123 deaths, although underreporting means numbers are likely tp be much higher.Community leaders, activists and organisers of social projects in favelas in São Paulo, Belém, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Manaus, Belo Horizonte and São Luís have been delivering food and hygiene kits to desperate residents as hunger begins to bite.They worry that coronavirus could spread rapidly in the crowded houses and alleyways, where there is often no basic sanitation, health services can be precarious and diseases such as tuberculosis and Zika have thrived.The pandemic has exposed how little the Brazilian state knows about its poorest citizens, with the government grappling for weeks over an emergency monthly payment of $116 for three months to up to 25 million “informal” workers and the unemployed before launching an app last Tuesday. It also froze electricity bills for low-income Brazilians for three months.People unable to access the payment reportedly queued at tax offices and government banks in cities across Brazil. Some lacked the right social security numbers and as activists noted, not everybody has a mobile phone or credit for internet access.Favelas nationwide were already organising. Some activists, like Rosas in Belém, are part of the national G10 favela network, set up by Gilson Rodrigues, president of the residents association in São Paulo’s huge Paraisópolis favela. G10 held a summit there last November, which Rosas attended. Its organisational methods are being adopted across Brazil.As Rodrigues pointed out in a video widely shared on social media, the word favela has been conspicuously absent in government communication. “It’s like we’re not Brazilians and we don’t exist,” he told the .Paraisópolis has delivered 15,000 food parcels, set up a communal kitchen and launched a scheme for people to “adopt” maids laid off from jobs in the upscale neighbourhoods where coronavirus first emerged. “Street presidents” explain the importance of social distancing and hand hygiene, organise donations and organise the two doctors, three nurses and three ambulances the favela has hired. It is even building a field hospital.“We are mounting a war structure because we believe we are being abandoned to our own fate,” Rodrigues said. “We believe the cases are coming.”In Belo Horizonte’s Aglomerado da Serra favela, 45 volunteers distributed 3,500 food parcels, said Cristiane Pereira, president of its residents association. Its “village presidents’”were adapted from G10. “We learned the right way to mobilise the community,” Pereira said.In Rio de Janeiro, Raniele Batista, 38, had just received a food parcel in the sprawling Complexo do Alemão favela.“We have nine people at home, seven children, my husband was just laid off, the situation gets worse and worse,” she said. “Thank God I got a food parcel here but I don’t know about tomorrow.”Her donation came from Champion Embrace (Abraço Campeão), a martial arts project run by resident Alan Duarte, now delivering food parcels to 400 families. “We are very scared that coronavirus will hit favelas hard,” Duarte said. Deaths from coronavirus have already been reported in Rio’s Rocinha, Maré and Manguinhos favelas.“People are worried about how to survive,” said CUFA founder Celso Athayde. The network of more than 400 favelas has distributed thousands of tons of food as well as soap donated by the public and major companies, he said.“When you go to the gas station … it’s a favela resident who attends you,” Athayde said. “When you go to the supermarket, the cashier is a favela resident, the stockists, the cleaner, the security guard all live in favelas.”President Jair Bolsonaro has attacked social isolation, ordered Brazilians back to work and mixed with people in Brasília, contradicting his own health minister, Luiz Mandetta, Brazil’s state governments and the World Health Organization.“These conflicting messages send people back on to the street,” said Ricardo Fernandes, an actor from the Arteiros theatre group in Rio’s City of God (Cidade de Deus) favela. The group is part of the City of God Front (Frente CDD), which handed out 1,000 food parcels this week.The government’s lack of unity contrasts with the way different favela groups and organisations have come together. “People put aside any differences and rivalries,” Fernandes said.Increasingly, people across Brazil are following Bolsonaro’s instructions as lockdown disintegrates. His commands were reinforced by evangelical pastors in the Coroadinho favela in São Luís in the north-east state of Maranhão.Three residents were in home quarantine last week with suspected coronavirus, but people filled the streets and shops were open, said teacher Christiane Mendes. “Here we work the morning to eat in the afternoon. They can’t close,” she said of local stores.Mendes is part of an education association delivering food and hygiene products to poorer residents, some of whom live in houses of wood and earth bricks without running water. She has not been able to register on the government app for the emergency payment, nor has anyone in her family.“The crisis just threw light on what we already suffer, it intensified everything, the water, food problems, security,” she said. “It made the world really listen to the favela’s voice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f71d41678085def4b6d9f13fe6cfb3f7525fd5/109_207_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b01a4f71b8c16a880e8db01d647ea0ca","title":"how we met within hours i knew i would marry her","story":"Santiago and Gisela Klein, 55 and 48, met on a beach in Uruguay in 1994. Originally from Argentina, they now live in HertfordshireIn January 1994, Santiago Klein was taking a break from city life with a beach holiday in Uruguay. “It was a popular place for people living in Argentina to visit. I started talking to Gisela’s sister because she knows my sister,” he recalls. It wasn’t long before the pair were introduced, and he asked if she wanted to go on a date later that day. “I noticed her eyes at first, and I really liked her.” They arranged to go out at midnight. “In Latin America, we go out late and stay out until 5am,” says Santiago. “I went out for dinner with my family first and they asked about my date but I couldn’t remember her name. I just knew there was something about her I really liked.”Keen to impress his date, he admits he was showing off at the start. “At first, I thought he was a bit full of himself, but I soon realised he was really down to earth and lovely,” says Gisela. “I went home and told my mum and auntie that I’d found the man I was going to marry.”Santiago felt the same way. “We had lots in common and wanted the same things in life. In the space of a couple of hours I knew I would marry her.” Though they were both coming out of long-term relationships, something felt right between them. “I had never thought about marriage before and suddenly I just knew,” says Santiago.A few days later, he returned to Buenos Aires for work, while Gisela continued her holiday. “He came back to Uruguay a week later and he proposed,” she says. “We went to a market seller there and he bought the rings.”Gisela was also living in Buenos Aires at the time, and the pair returned to the city together after their travels were over. “I joke that she comes from the posh bit of the city, like Chelsea in London,” says Santiago. “And I am from the equivalent of Hendon.” The couple arranged their wedding for 6 November 1994, exactly 10 months after they met. “We wanted it to be the same day of the month,” he says.Before the wedding, the couple had to tell their parents about their plans. “We went for dinner with my family and we just kept on ordering more food,” says Gisella. “He was so nervous about telling them.” Eventually Santiago plucked up courage. “My father-in-law looked at me, finished drinking his coffee and then said: ‘I knew you would marry her I just thought you’d wait a bit longer.’ They’d only known me for about 15 minutes.”Since they married, the couple have had three children, Freddie, Maggie and Max. They have lived in both the UK and the US, moving around for Santiago’s work in property development while Gisela cared for the children. The first move came in 2001, during a period of riots and instability in Argentina. “Things weren’t good at home, so when Santiago suggested the move I thought ‘Why not?’,” says Gisela. She admits life in the UK was hard at first as she spoke no English and had young children. “Over 10 years, I learned to really love it.”In 2010, the family moved to Florida. “We knew it wasn’t going to be for us long-term,” Santiago says. “We said we needed to move back home but neither of us knew whether that meant Argentina or the UK.”They moved to England again in 2016. As well as having plenty of friends in the UK, Gisela says they love the “fairness” of British society. “It feels like a caring place to live.” But they visit their family in Argentina as often as they can – and at Christmas and New Year they return to the beach in Uruguay where they met.Santiago says their marriage has always felt right. “She complements me so well. And I have always loved the way she smiles with her eyes and not just her mouth.” Gisela has always known that she and her husband were meant to be. “He has lots of regrets in life, but he always says he has never regretted marrying me, not once.”• Want to share your story?

Some people thought I was singing, “On the dole, all day”’Before Harry’s Game aired over three nights, we went to a private press showing in London to around 100 people. At the end of the first hour-long episode, the house lights came up, the song played and nobody reacted. I thought, “That’s that.” After the second hour, there were less people talking over the music. The third episode was devastating. Both main characters died. Then the music came on. Not one person stood up, and the music just played out. That’s when we knew the song had touched a nerve.I didn’t think I had much of a voice. I would have loved to have been a rock’n’roller, but gradually I realised that I had a different timbre and an ethereal feel, which is very much part of the Clannad sound. Whenever people ask where that sound comes from I say, “Go to Donegal. You’ll feel the earthiness and the atmosphere.”The Irish Gaelic lyrics for Theme from Harry’s Game derived from a saying in a book of old Irish proverbs that our grandfather had given Ciarán: “Everything that is and will be, will cease to be. The moon and the stars, youth and beauty.” There’s no solution to war, just people killing each other. We were never a political band, but the sentiment that all things must pass inspired the lyrics.The chorus, “Fol lol the doh, fol the day, fol the doh fol the day,” comes from ancient Irish “mouth-music”. It was common in the reels and jigs world, but Ciarán thought it would be good to slow it down. Some people thought I was singing, “On the dole, all day.” Yorkshire TV sent over an engineer, Richard Dodd, who’d worked on 10cc’s I’m Not in Love and introduced us to the idea of layering the vocals. Ciarán and I sang looking right at each other. We could feel the emotion of the song. I think we used the second take, and layered it on top of that.There were only three TV channels back then, so we knew people would watch Harry’s Game. Noel Edmonds played the song on Radio 1 for the first time and then after the next song he said: “We’ve been inundated with people asking, ‘What was that?’” So he played it again. Bono said that when he first heard it in a car, he had to pull over. Then because of the Troubles it was taken off the radio for a day in case it was offensive, so we sent them the translation and they played it again.One day, we were in a Transit van in Germany the next we were being picked up in a limo to do Top of the Pops and taking pictures of ourselves jumping in and out. It was unreal for a small Irish folk band from Donegal. I was the first female Irish folk singer to break abroad. People started calling me the First Lady of Celtic Music, a title I’m really proud of."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88df48f4e521e3efff65a498a2721be006d8621/0_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53e92ede46d79d513c870e8fef4371f7","title":"coronavirus looking for good news run for heroes and an opera singing doctor","story":"Running fundraiser for NHS and frontline workers raises over £1m and the BBC announces a star-studded Big Night In The lockdown may be stretching the country’s patience to the limit, but it hasn’t deterred fundraisers trying to support the NHS and the workers on the frontline of the crisis.One running challenge has gone viral and has already raised £1m a BBC Big Night In will likely raise much more. A 5km running challenge has raised over £1m for NHS staff in just over two weeks after going viral on social media.The Run for Heroes campaign challenges people to use their permitted daily exercise to run 5km, donate £5 to help frontline NHS workers, and then tag five others to do the same.It has quickly spread on social media, with more than 200,000 runners taking part across 10 different countries.“Your love and support has raised money to go towards wellbeing packs, accommodation and travel for NHS workers and volunteers, provide longer-term mental health support for staff and families effected, and help patients leave hospital quickly and safely,” Run for Heroes said in a post announcing the £1m total.A number of high-profile celebrities have taken up the challenge, including singer Ellie Goulding, Olympic medal winner Mo Farah, footballer John Terry and DJ Chris Moyles.The campaign was launched by London-based documentary producer Olivia Strong, 27, on 28 March with the run.for.heroes Instagram page. She originally aimed to raise £5,000, but after reaching her target in just four days, she decided to extend the challenge.Matt Baker, Zoe Ball, Lenny Henry, Davina McCall and Paddy McGuinness have been confirmed as hosts of the BBC’s Big Night In, airing next week.The programme, a first-time collaboration between BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief, will celebrate the acts of kindness and the spirit of hope that have sustained the nation during the Covid-19 pandemic.Peter Kay, Catherine Tate and Gary Barlow will also be taking part from home, with further stars to be announced.Ball said: “We are always so blown away by folks’ generosity each year supporting Comic Relief and Children in Need and now, during these extraordinary times, more than ever people in our communities are in need of our love and support.”The show will air live on Thursday 23 April from 7pm, with music, comedy sketches and competitions, and any money raised will be matched pound for pound by the Treasury, as announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week.The money will be split equally between BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief to provide essential support to local charities, projects and programmes across the UK, to help people most in need of all ages and backgrounds.A doctor who has returned to the NHS to help treat Covid-19 patients has been entertaining his colleagues with his opera singing.Tenor Alex Aldren, or “Dr Opera”, has been serenading fellow medics by singing on the wards in his scrubs, even while wearing a face mask.A\u0026ampE nurse Mikaela posted a video of Aldren singing at Newham hospital in London, saying, “Music can heal the wounds which medicine cannot touch”, and adding that he was “an amazing opera singer”.Aldren trained in medicine but left the profession to become a tenor, and has recently returned to his old job, along with hundreds of others who recently left the NHS, to offer his skills in the fight against the pandemic.In another video posted on Twitter, emergency doctor Russell said, “He’s treating the team to some shows during quieter periods!

The House of Commons commission, the cross-party body in charge of Commons administration, is due to meet on Thursday to consider options, and it is expected that MPs will be asked to vote in favour of the new procedures when they return to Westminster next Tuesday.According to one MP familiar with the commission’s discussions, what is being proposed will amount to a hybrid parliament. He explained: “There will be some members in the chamber, and there will be some members who will be contributing digitally.”Throughout the recess, parliament’s digital services team has been putting in place technology that would allow this to work and now insiders are confident that question sessions in the Commons, such as PMQs, could involve many MPs participating by submitting questions electronically, using video conferencing technology.“We will have very, very slimmed-down proceedings – with just a skeleton group of ministers and MPs in the house,” said another commission source.Opposition parties are comfortable with these plans, although there is far less agreement about how the Commons can continue to debate and vote on legislation in an era of physical distancing. Commons debates normally involve speakers taking spontaneous interventions from MPs, which would be hard to facilitate via video conferencing, and MPs have always resisted attempts to get them to vote electronicall instead of in person in the ision lobbies.Before the Easter recess the parties agreed to limit the number of isions they called on legislation and Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, proposed getting MPs to vote in smaller groups, which would have meant a ision taking up to 40 minutes, not 15 minutes as now.But these are not seen as long-term solutions to the problems created by coronavirus. In a letter to the Speaker sent last week, Karen Bradley, the chair of the Commons procedure committee, said her committee did not view these plans to limit the number of isions as sustainable.She said: “Every colleague is entitled to express an opinion … in debate and in the lobbies. Members of the committee have expressed concerns that the time taken in isions under the social distancing procedures which you have announced will inhibit colleagues from testing the will of the house as they are entitled to do.”Bradley also said in her letter to Hoyle that, although some MPs agreed that they should be staying away from parliament to set an example, others thought that much of what happened in the chamber “cannot be replicated by virtual means” and that it was necessary for MPs to continue to visit their workplace “in the same way as other key workers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671abac647e875cf4c66f5d2dd91d77bdad442b7/381_86_2741_1645/master/2741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e455234be7cb86001a526d7454e4fcf","title":"raab sticks to the old non je ne regrette rien","story":"Though he couldn’t clear up confusion on the UK’s death figures, the foreign secretary is now almost managing a swaggerIt’s come to something when Dominic Raab is quite clearly the best person available for the job. With Boris Johnson likely to be out of action at Chequers for the coming weeks, Robert Jenrick getting stuck in transit between any of his three houses, Michael Gove being unable to explain why his daughter is a higher priority for a coronavirus test than a frontline NHS worker – has any situation ever been improved by Mikey not staying at home? – and Priti Patel being Priti Patel, there are few obvious alternatives to Raab to front up the daily Downing Street press conference.Which isn’t to say that Dom is by any means an ideal choice. Practice hasn’t made perfect, but it has made him a bit less rubbish. He’ll never be totally relaxed – his missing-person habit is hard to break – but he is a lot less sweaty and nervy than he was last week when he was visibly struggling. There’s almost a swagger. Albeit one that barely disguises his low threshold for boredom. Because Dom is not dim – well, not compared with many of his colleagues – and the tedium of having nothing new to say has already got to him. He can’t even bring himself to go through the charade of appearing interested. The briefing is just a half-hour ordeal to be endured.Stifling a yawn, the foreign secretary began by thanking NHS staff. Not just for saving Boris, but for all their efforts elsewhere. My guess is that most NHS workers were either too busy or too knackered to have paid much attention. If the government is sincere in its newfound gratitude for a health service that it has been happy to underfund and understaff for the past 10 years, it is going to have to be prepared to alienate its traditional low-tax Tory voters. Not to mention the Brexiters who want many of the immigrants who work in the NHS to sod off.Raab then moved on the daily figures. The death rate was down a bit, but then it always is at weekends, as for some reason the person whose job it is to do the counting doesn’t work on Sundays. He was more indirectly straightforward – Dom can’t do anything without having first out-thought himself – on why deaths in care homes weren’t being included in the daily stats. Because if they were, then everyone would see that many more people were dying than he was prepared to admit.Visibly losing the will to live, Dom also failed to adequately explain why, halfway into the government’s target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, we were still only managing about 18,000. It was like this: the coronavirus was a tricky bugger that spread exponentially. So the only way to combat it was to be even more cunning. Start by doing almost no tests and then take it by surprise by testing exponentially. The reason we were apparently so far behind was to lull the coronavirus into a false sense of security.“This is a national test,” Raab concluded. Really? The whole thing is just an Ant Middleton SAS: Who Dares Wins TV show, where the first country to break the lockdown gets thrown off the course. Silly, silly me. There was I imagining that what we were really dealing with was a global pandemic that required proper scientific evidence, when reality it was a psycho standoff between us and the virus to see who gives way first.Nor did the questions from the media produce much in the way of straight answers. The government doesn’t yet seem to have even reached a point where there is a plan of what criteria might need to be met to end the lockdown or which groups might be allowed out first. Presumably Raab is still banking on using his black-belt martial arts skills to defeat the coronavirus with a straight ippon. “I’m sorry, I can’t really hear you,” was as far as he got in offering an apology for Priti Patel’s suggestion that most NHS staff were wasting PPE protection at fancy dress parties. So no. He wasn’t sorry at all. Besides, no one was going to be seeing Patel again in the foreseeable futureInevitably – because these briefings always do – the questions turned to why, even without the care home and death-in-the-community figures, the UK was heading for the worst mortality rate in Europe. Was this part of the plan? Raab’s face momentarily turned to panic. No one had ever called what the government had done up till now a plan. More like a “take it a day at a time and hope something turns up” approach.Did the government regret not acting a bit quicker? A month ago, it was advising 250,000 people to get stuck in together at the Cheltenham festival when other countries were in lockdown. Dom was firmly of the “Je ne regrette rien” école. Never explain, never apologise. So what if the death toll was now over 11,000 and rising by hundreds per day?We shouldn’t read anything into South Korea’s low mortality rates, he said, because they weren’t comparing like with like. We were excluding many more Covid-19 deaths than them. We were just doing them a favour to make them look good. But you could be damned sure if it was the UK that was at the bottom of the death charts, the government would be shouting about it from the rooftops. And I, for one one, would be applauding them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2b3a4c25ba5cef36fe8661c8545d895cdb30f3/0_74_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8f019e394568c9f5320e1b450ee6f5bb","title":"covid 19 how vulnerable are people with asthma","story":"Nicola Davis speaks to Dr Andy Whittamore about the effects of Covid-19 on people with asthma and what they can do to protect themselves"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d35dd6aced5bb8c6854f563c192322dd9195b89f/0_297_6267_3760/master/6267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b0839655cc56b6cfba8434f516aa23d","title":"my working week mother arrives refuge covid 19 symptoms","story":"We are getting full very quickly but it’s important that women who have survived domestic abuse know we can support themMy first task is to review staffing levels and check in with everyone across the different refuges. Some staff are now working remotely or self-isolating but so far, so good. Those of us travelling into the offices are worried. No one wants to take this virus home to families, and whatever precautions we put in place there is still that thought in the back of our minds.I check the post and see something that looks like a National Insurance number for a resident. She has been waiting several weeks and without it her first benefit payment won’t be released. I let the woman know – she is relieved.I sign a food bank voucher for a family who arrived a week ago (thankfully they are still operating). Then we have our daily virtual check-in as a team. We talk about how difficult everyone is finding social distancing, especially with the toddlers who just want to run up and hug you.It’s exhausting work at the best of times, but now even more so for those people who are physically in the refuge. Those off site feel guilty about not being there they see how hard it is and really want to help, but their health has to come first. We talk through these feelings at our virtual staff meetings.A colleague from a nearby refuge belonging to the charity I work for tells me a family has arrived with symptoms of coronavirus. The mother didn’t know if they would be accepted, but she was so pleased to be offered a self-contained unit for herself and her children to recover in away from other families. A resident’s mental health has declined significantly since the lockdown. Without college, volunteering and face-to-face counselling, she is struggling. We are concerned she is getting caught up in the past and the emotions that go with the abuse she survived. I get in touch with our local housing team to find out what their plans are. They confirm they are operating remotely using telephone interviews, and that viewings and temporary accommodation allocations will go ahead with appropriate precautions. I dial into a meeting hosted by the local authority. Everyone is relieved to hear that refuges are still running, taking referrals and bringing in families in need.A resident asks about an email she has received from her solicitor she has been granted her leave to remain, but she can’t pick up her new biometric card until the solicitor’s office is open again.A five-year-old comes into the office to make a call to a staff member who is shielding. I hear him say “I miss you so much, have you gone forever?”. We get a big delivery of craft resources to share between all the families in the service. The children and family worker was going to come in to sort them out but she has developed a cough so needs to self-isolate. The children are getting increasingly restless so I start iding out resources into bags while taking other calls.In the staff catch-up we talk about referrals and how many more women we are seeing. We all think this will increase in the weeks to come. As not all move-on options are available for women, we are getting full quickly.I install a wifi booster. The teenager downstairs is very relieved she has been struggling to upload her homework and as she is self-isolating she can’t use the desk in the main lounge anymore. I talk one mum through how to use the food voucher she has just received as part of the free school meals. English is not her first language and I have to stay a safe distance but we get there in the end.My colleague tells me the family with coronavirus are starting to recover. It’s heartening to hear how all of the other women came together to make the family meals and left them at their door. The department for work and pensions calls to update me on how they are changing their processes to deal with the 1m extra claims, and what the escalation process will be for agencies working with vulnerable people, including domestic violence survivors, to ensure they can access their benefits.I’m emotionally drained but feel really proud of my staff and the residents. My final job before I head home is to check all the families have enough cleaning supplies for the weekend.The author of this piece is a domestic abuse service manager for Hestia, a charity supporting adults and children in crisis.

Not being able to compare prices of food in different shops, for example, is making budgeting harder than ever. “I used to go to two or three shops several times a week to seek out the best prices, making sure I got the most out of my money,” says the former teacher, who is bringing up two young children alone.On top of that, the children being at home means extra expenses. “I need more food, more gas and electric, with them being in and at home 247, and I want to get them little things to keep them entertained. But I just don’t have the money for it,” she explains. “The food banks that I used to rely on are now reserved for the most vulnerable.”McCausland, who has been on the benefit since 2018, is far from alone in having to rely on universal credit. Extraordinarily high numbers of people in desperate need of a financial safety net have applied since the pandemic began. In the fortnight to 30 March alone, almost a million new claims were made for the benefit. In Northern Ireland, where McCausland lives, the number is 33,000 – a tenfold rise in the normal rate of claims.With the fast-rising number of claimants as a result of the pandemic, forthcoming research I undertook with a colleague on the implementation of universal credit in Northern Ireland, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, could provide valuable lessons for the rest of the UK.While the people we spoke to, like McCausland, had mainly negative things to say about universal credit, they experienced the benefit differently because of being resident in Northern Ireland. This distinctive landscape, largely a legacy of recent conflict, includes higher levels of economic inactivity than the rest of the UK (but lower rates of unemployment) and higher levels of disability. While social security policy in Northern Ireland has traditionally mirrored that in England and Wales (what is known as the principle of parity), political opposition to the coalition government’s 2010-15 welfare reforms contributed first to the collapse of the Northern Ireland assembly and then to a range of measures designed to shield citizens from the worst effects of the benefit changes.In England and Wales, universal credit is paid monthly, with the housing element going directly to the tenant. By contrast, in Northern Ireland, people are paid fortnightly and the housing payment is made directly to the landlord. This means that recipients have shorter periods to wait between payments. While there have been teething problems, if implemented effectively it should mean that claimants do not have to worry about paying rent to their landlords, making arrears less likely.Maria Thompson, a single parent in her 30s from Belfast, says her family would really struggle if faced with monthly payments: “There is no way I could manage. A month is just far too long to make such a small amount of money last. As it is, I run out of money every week and have to borrow from family until my next payment comes.”In Northern Ireland, recipients also benefit from a package of “welfare mitigations” introduced under the 2015 Fresh Start agreement, which includes supplementary payments to benefit claimants to offset both the bedroom tax – which reduces the amount of universal credit received if claimants have spare rooms – and the benefits cap, which limits the amount a household with no one in paid work can receive in benefits. The bedroom tax supplementary payment is especially important because of the high level of under-occupancy in Northern Ireland, and the difficulty for many in moving because of the enduring segregation of the housing stock along religious lines. Alan Harris, who is in his 50s and has longstanding health conditions, receives a supplementary payment of £55 a month to mitigate the bedroom tax, as he lives alone in a three-bedroom property. Harris, who moved to universal credit after the death of his mother, for whom he had been caring, has lived in the same house since it was built more than 30 years ago. He cannot imagine moving, but nor can he afford the £73 to meet the rent shortfall. “If I had to pay that extra, I just couldn’t do it,” he says. “I would have to get a wee one-bed flat, but one-bed flats are like gold dust around here.”In Northern Ireland, there is also a contingency fund, which provides discretionary non-repayable financial support to help with the transition on to universal credit. Although many people have found it difficult to access, and information about it hard to find, recent changes mean this should improve in the future.Of course, universal credit in Northern Ireland, as elsewhere in the UK, still drives debt, creates and exacerbates mental health problems, and affects whole families in profoundly negative ways. As McCausland puts it, the benefit is “financially crippling and emotionally bruising people”.The coronavirus pandemic is exposing the significant shortcomings with our social security system. While the chancellor has increased the standard allowance for universal credit by £20 a week over the next 12 months, and suspended sanctions, these changes could be only temporary measures. The five-week wait for the benefit continues, and the government is still collecting advance payments that claimants have to pay back, even during this crisis.Back in Belfast, McCausland hopes that the growing number of people on universal credit will lead to long-term changes to benefits and action on child poverty.“The government has finally realised people just can’t live on the amounts they get on universal credit,” says McCausland. “But this isn’t news to people like us, who’ve been on it for months and years. What we need now is for politicians to get rid of advance payments, provide better advice and information to new claimants, and stop the benefit triggering debt. Most of all, start really listening to those of us on the benefit, who know exactly what needs to change and why.”Some names have been changed.• Additional reporting by Mark Simpson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59db9902bb3b0d9f73efb62a2835bc97328ef0e6/4_164_3588_2153/master/3588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=886ec8ca6594720cd55679fdf22ae331","title":"bradley wiggins mark cavendish british cycling tokyo olympics","story":"Sir Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish have aimed stinging criticism at British Cycling, the sport’s national governing body, in a Q\u0026ampA session on Instagram.In Sunday’s broadcast, the now-retired 2012 Tour de France champion Wiggins and Cavendish, who has won 30 stages at the Tour and rides for Bahrain–McLaren, discussed the latter’s non-selection for the postponed Tokyo Olympics. Cavendish hoped to compete in the Madison in Japan and win the Olympic gold medal that has eluded him but he was not selected by British Cycling.In a report by cyclingnews, Cavendish was quoted as saying: “It’s hard for me to go. British Cycling have been … they realised now they don’t want to be in the position where they have to not take me. They said to me: ‘You haven’t done any World Cups.’ When have I had to do World Cups?”Wiggins replied: “That’s the thing that’s lacking now in British Cycling: someone who actually knows what they’re talking about. It’s all about box-ticking. With you it was just a case of opening a few doors so you could get qualified, knowing you would deliver on the day, which you do and always did – three world titles, Olympic medal and all that.“That’s sort of been taken away now. They’d rather someone qualified for all the World Cups, then finished 10th in the Olympics. I think it’s shit, to be honest, but hey, cycling has changed so much.” The pair went on to discuss how British Cycling had asked for the return of equipment – bikes and skinsuits – with which they competed at previous Olympics. Wiggins said of his bike from the 2012 time trial: “They didn’t have a choice with me. I’m fucking taking it, it’s mine, I fucking did it, I’m having it.”Cavendish said: “I’ve still got a skinsuit but they took the skinsuits back. What are we going to do? Show it off to people and say ‘copy this’?”Wiggins added: “I’ve still got my skinsuit as well. They’re not having it. Fuck off. Try and get it from me. They try and take it back and it’s like, well, we did it, we grafted … These are my memories.”The pair have broadcast regular informal chats on Instagram in recent months, discussing their careers, the wider sport and taking questions from fans and fellow cyclists.Wiggins and Team Sky (now Team Ineos) have been embroiled in controversy since the Fancy Bears leaks in 2016 relating to therapeutic use exemptions during his career.

It’s a haunting sound and it’s almost as if you’re in a war,” Ian McKinley says as he begins to explain the impact of the lockdown in Italy which began on 9 March and will now continue for at least another three weeks. McKinley, the Irish rugby player who lost the sight in his left eye when he was raked at the bottom of a ruck in Dublin in 2010, understands adversity.The 30-year-old also understands better than most how you come back from uncertain times. Having been forced into retirement he took a chance in 2012 and accepted an offer to do some informal coaching in a small Italian city, Udine, near the Slovenian border. Neither he nor his girlfriend, Cordelia, who is now his wife, could speak any Italian but they adapted. Then, with the help of his brother, McKinley decided to try to play rugby again while wearing specially designed goggles which could protect his eyes. Slowly, but with inspirational determination, McKinley came back to professional rugby – with such impact that he has played nine Tests for Italy at fly-half.McKinley and his wife now live in Treviso, in northern Italy, close to the area that has been hit so severely by Covid-19. He is engaging and intelligent – and also a compelling witness to the Italian lockdown. Britain and Ireland are weeks behind Italy, both in terms of facing the worst of the pandemic, and also in coping with such stringent self‑isolation. Hearing his calm voice from Treviso, and seeing his wry and wistful expressions on my laptop screen, McKinley is like a guide from the future. Amid the ghostly life he has lived the past six weeks, and the continuing worry, he has found hope and light.“We’ve been in a lockdown for over a month now and thankfully the silence and the sirens have subsided somewhat. It’s become a bit better the past few days. The numbers are going down a little. But it still feels very surreal to have gone from living your life to the fullest, being involved with lots of things, to basically zero. You can only walk around if you have a pet to exercise and so we’re lucky we have a little dog. We’re allowed out once a day to walk the dog and there’s no one around. This little city I live in is not like Dublin or London – but 70,000 people still live here. And it’s completely dead.The curbing of freedom is working, slowly, even if the death rate is still distressing. “It’s well over 19,000 now,” McKinley says, “but the rate of deaths per day is going down. The rate of infection is going down. That’s all you can do – try and find something positive in this mad pandemic. Time will tell which measures have been most effective. It seems as if the UK started out doing things differently and now the lockdown is maybe not being followed as closely as in Italy.”Britain has now passed the highest daily death rate suffered in both Italy and Spain. “The measures that have been taken by the Italian government have been heavily criticised by a lot of people,” McKinley says, “but they’ve worked pretty well. I think they’ve acted in the best way they could have.”It’s also helped that, from the outset, virtually all Italians have adhered to the rigorous lockdown while avoiding the kind of panic buying that accompanied the UK’s initial response. “A huge amount of credit has to go to the Italian people because there’s been no panic buying. We’ve not had any toilet paper wars here. Certain things like flour and eggs are a bit lower than normal. But it’s never got to a stage where people are fighting over things. When people are backed into a corner, and there’s a lot of adversity, you definitely get a sense of community spirit in Italy, of making sure that each person is OK. People are pulling together and wanting to keep each other strong to try and get through this.”His own situation feels more precarious because, as McKinley admits, “I haven’t played many games this year. The difference with Italian clubs in relation to British and Irish rugby is that there are no second teams. We’re a squad of 52 and only 23 people go out on to a rugby field to play. It’s been a bit up and down for me this year.“So, yeah, this virus has thrown a ner in the works. I have a contract this year with Benetton – but we can’t say what will happen next season because people can’t commit to anything. When you’re cooped up in a house for months you can definitely think of the worst-case scenario. Or you can look at it as a good break for your body and time to reflect on what’s really important. In terms of pay cuts I’m sure players will not begrudge that because this is just such a huge issue.”McKinley has obviously come through testing times before. “My life was turned upside down in 2010 with the eye injury. And then, ultimately, when I made the decision in 2011 to retire. I moved to Udine when I was 22 and not knowing the language is tricky. You certainly learn a lot about yourself. You basically sink or swim in those situations. I adapted so I’m forever grateful I made the decision to come over. I’ve made friends for life. Thankfully from the work side of things it’s worked out really well. I’m also very fortunate to have two homes because my family are back in Ireland. But my wife and I have created a home in Italy.”He laughs when saying that he often dreams in Italian now. But McKinley pauses when I ask if Italy has changed him as a person. “That’s a very good question. I think it has. Absolutely. People have said to me: ‘You were on course for this great career in Ireland,’ and I was dealt that hand. Other people are dealt their hand and they have to get through whatever problems they’ve faced. For me, it’s opened up the world. So for example, working with the Laureus organisation in so many different areas of Italy has made me see how they use sport against violence, discrimination and disadvantage around the world. Now we’re at a standstill Laureus is working closely with 200 sports and their development programmes globally to ensure they get support during the pandemic.“So, going back to your question about change through adversity, I would not be speaking Italian if I was still living in Ireland. I would not have been exposed to everything that has been so positive for me in Italy. I certainly appreciate things a lot more. I want to win rugby games and trophies, of course, but when you step back and think about what’s important in life, you get a real perspective. I still want to perform at the highest level but so much else matters more.”Thousands of young rugby players around the world wear the goggles that McKinley helped pioneer – and he is contacted regularly by partially sighted people who still want to succeed in sport. “I get messages weekly from people who have had similar injuries or problems to mine. That’s incredible. And knowing that 2,000 people around the world are using rugby goggles is wonderful. The idea of the goggles were in the pipeline but my brother Phillip put me in touch with Johnny Merrigan, an Irish design student, who is a very important part of this story. Myself, Phillip and Johnny got together and basically pushed the product over the line. The manufacturing company obviously take the plaudits because they’ve produced the goggles.”McKinley would like to move into coaching once his playing career ends. “Even when I stopped playing the first time I wanted to become a coach. I still have that passion. I really enjoy seeing players grow and develop because rugby is a wonderful sport for inclusion. I’ve had two years of coaching experience, from when I first came to Italy, and I loved it.”In the meantime, like the rest of us, McKinley has to wait and hope that he and his family and all those he cares about survive the coronavirus crisis. “It’s difficult,” he agrees. “You go through good days and bad days. For us, it’s a very small sacrifice to sit in our nice apartments, with modern technology, and wait it out. There are people out there on the front line, fighting it every day. So we just need to stay home and follow the guidelines.”When I suggest that even the first time he gets tackled hard on the training field will feel good, McKinley grins. “Depends who it’s from. But the little things in life that you take for granted are going to seem sweet. To walk down to a coffee shop, and just talk to the people you know, your friends and rugby mates, will feel very special. But everybody is in the same boat. It helps to know that the vast majority of the human population is in this together.”Ian McKinley and Laureus encourage everyone to stay home, stay safe and stay healthy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e57e17a4bf87bd35f97ac1da7010793438f083/0_270_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=189de1733f927fae81544c1c01fb1f7b","title":"unease resounds across cricket without the comforting hum of county game","story":"County cricket’s defiantly low-key nature has brought joy to millions but may not save it in a looming era of belt-tighteningThe ice cream stand at Worcester. The grass bank at Canterbury. The tree-lined riverside approach to Sophia Gardens in Cardiff, one of those grounds that always seems to be wet, even when it’s dry. The way the sunlight dapples off the new pavilion at Headingley as Steve Patterson lopes in for his eighth over. The second-hand bookshop at Derby where you could spend an entire afternoon browsing the modest selection of tea-stained hardbacks with alluring titles such as An Illustrated History of Ilkeston CC 1910-1985 and Keeper’s End! Horace Baggs: A Life In Cricket.It’s funny what you miss when you’re indoors. Of all the privations we are enduring as a people, the loss of county cricket should probably sit some way down the list. But there were times during the listless, gloriously sunny weekend when it was perhaps only natural to wonder, idly and hypothetically, how the opening day of the 2020 County Championship season was going.Sunday it was, or at least should have been. Sibley v Philander at Taunton. Pujara v Maharaj at Headingley. Some 20-year-old seamer you’d never heard of taking six for spit. England’s top-order batting candidates falling over each other in a deluge of single-figure scores. Bumper bank holiday crowds. But perhaps what we missed above all was the promise and the hope, the sense of renewal and rebirth, the first chilly pint of the summer, the conviction that finally, this would be the year you made it to Wantage Road.Instead: nothing. A whispering void. The first seven rounds of the championship have already been called off. It’s probably safe to say they won’t be rescheduled. The talk is that with the shutdown poised to endure well into the summer, this year’s competition will be scrapped entirely in order to ensure the “most financially important forms of the game” – essentially, England and the Twenty20 Blast – can be prioritised.At which point: what? The simplest answer is that, like most of the other events that have fallen to Covid‑19, you simply skip a year and start afresh in 2021. But this would be to overlook the many aspects in which the championship is not like other events.In a way, it’s unique. It’s a competition that does not generate significant revenue, indeed it haemorrhages it in vast sums to the point where there are a number of counties who are quietly relieved not to be playing it. Unless you’re watching extremely closely, it creates neither buzz nor water-cooler moments. It does not fill acres of broadcasting time. Sky are not banging down the doors of the ECB demanding it be played at all costs. It is not part of the national conversation and will not be part of our collective healing process.The entire point of the County Championship, insofar as there is one, is to exist. It provides an ambient background hum to a busy season, quietly develops the next generation of international players, offers immeasurable comfort to the millions who will never set foot inside a ground and the thousands who do. In other words, it serves no wider purpose than simply to happen. And so when it doesn’t happen, the effect is more seismic and disturbing than simply scratching off one Boat Race, one Wimbledon, one Tour de France. The temptation, rather, is to wonder whether it will ever recover.This is after all a competition that has been tinkered to death – formats adulterated, schedules scrambled, rules tweaked, teams assembled and dissolved mid-season, whether through international availability or white‑ball blocks – only for that death to never materialise. This has generated an impression of timelessness and permanence, of an institution that can withstand pretty much anything you throw at it.But pandemic and penury have served up a starker, harsher reality. The talk coming from Lord’s now is of “keeping the lights on”, of redoubled priorities and focusing on what really matters. Where does a competition that stretches from April to September, takes up 14 weeks in the calendar, attracts tiny crowds and no broadcast income, fit into this new landscape? For decades the sport’s administrators have treated four-day cricket like the unloved jar of piccalilli in the back of the fridge: ignored, untended, shoved to the forgotten peripheries. Now catastrophe may just embolden them to finish what they started.And really, this is about far more than one competition, one format, even one sport. It’s about what happens when the doors are finally flung open and society clanks back into gear. What we choose to value. What it feels acceptable to fight for. Is it possible to aspire to more than simply keeping the lights on? Is it horrendously privileged to lionise the 18-county system and a proper first-class competition and sunny afternoons at Bristol and Hove when an entire sport is in crisis? Or are we doomed to a grim fight for survival, public bodies desperately trying to claw back lost income in increasingly undignified ways?“We must face the fact,” said the secretary of Warwickshire at their annual end-of-season dinner, “that we are providing a spectacle the public does not want.” That was in 1967. Then as now the championship offered the best, richest, most varied domestic red-ball cricket available anywhere on Earth. And yet decline – or at least the sensation of it – had long since taken root. Perhaps, in hindsight, the reckoning was coming all along. Perhaps one man’s moment of chaos is another man’s moment of clarity. Perhaps I should really have got to Wantage Road while I still had the chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf30cdbfdf0a7ef2e6c911b62dbe8012e405dca9/0_1307_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188bd6811f03cbd05cd7d4909559a119","title":"sir stirling moss motor racing legends life in pictures","story":"Stirling Moss, arguably the greatest driver never to have won the F1 drivers’ championship, has died.

Masterminded by New Movement Collective, a group of superlative contemporary dancers who come together to make ambitious happenings, we’ll have to bookmark that one for the future. But in the meantime, the company has made full-length films of its previous works available for free online.It’s an interesting proposition since the majority of NMC’s work is immersive performance, the very opposite of watching a static screen. Even in well-shot pieces such as these, there’s a question about whether the film stands alone as a piece of art, or merely a record of what took place. The live-ness of the experience is flattened, and rather than experiencing the serendipities of an improvised journey, the camera decides your view.Yet, as anyone who’s wandered confused around an immersive show will know, enforced focus can be a good thing. In Collapse (2016), one of the simplest scenes is made the strongest by the camera’s framing. Four dancers run on the spot, side by side, with detached determination, variously overtaking and dropping back in an interminable race with each other that has no destination. A perfect physical metaphor for modern life.One signature of the company is closely handled duets, often stripped of traditional gender roles. Another is their appetite for collaboration with technology, design and architecture. Casting Traces (2012) involved navigating a paper maze designed by architect Elin Eyborg. Inspired by Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy, it’s a piece full of mysterious strangers and doppelgangers, silhouettes and clever shadow play, and also a sense of cautious weariness that permeates a lot of NMC’s work.Nest (2013), took over the former Welsh Chapel (and ex-Limelight nightclub) in the West End of London to create a journey based loosely on Homer’s Odyssey. Architects Studio Weave designed huge, grid-like steel frames for the dancers to move in and around (at one point a boat cleverly appears inside them), and stunning lighting projections from Marshmallow Laser Feast make it look as if the floor is buckling in waves under the dancers’ feet. The flashing lights in the darkness, the clubby music mixed with Monteverdi – it was all pulse-raising when seen live and it’s still impressive on screen.But NMC’s architectural attention to space loses potency when you’re not experiencing it in three dimensions. And the things that make for curious surprise when you’re exploring an atmospheric building – discovering someone wedged up into the ceiling or two dancers wearing pig masks – just feel random on film. Yet there are also small moments, easily missed, that shine through, such as a snippet of a duet from Jonathan Goddard and Gemma Nixon, two dancers with rare affinity, moving with absolute seamlessness (the bit where Goddard rubs his temple along Nixon’s calf I rewound to savour again).On film, there’s no doubt that narrative is an easier sell than thematic or abstract dance, which demands a commitment from the viewer that we’re not in the habit of giving to the small screen. Without the excitement of being at a live event, weaknesses of choreography or concept are more exposed – you can sometimes feel the lack of a single, driving vision in the collective nature of NMC’s work. But whether it’s a document or a standalone work (jury’s out), there are still rewards to be found by delving into the archive. At least until the chance to be choreographed by robots comes around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c69d3e3258d8560ebc368ccdc8841853646260/2726_352_2359_1416/master/2359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a013cc3d94248e6a915f063e72fd89e2","title":"eamonn holmes says 5g coronavirus claims may not be false","story":"ITV host said ‘it’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative’The This Morning co-host Eamonn Holmes has suggested that it may “suit the state narrative” to dismiss false claims linking 5G technology and coronavirus.He spoke out on the ITV show after the presenter Alice Beer described the conspiracy theories as “ridiculous” and “incredibly stupid”.Holmes, who was co-presenting with his wife, Ruth Langsford, responded that “it’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative”.He told Beer: “I totally agree with everything you are saying but what I don’t accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don’t know it’s not true. No one should attack or damage or do anything like that but it’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative.”He added: “That’s all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind.”Holmes made the remarks after scientists dismissed any link between 5G and coronavirus, with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, previously calling a conspiracy theory, spread via YouTube, that linked the two “dangerous nonsense”.Viewers criticised the presenter’s comments on social media and accused him of legitimising baseless theories. One, vickster51, wrote: “So I’ve just heard This Morning presenter Eamonn Holmes legitimise the stories linking the coronavirus lockdown to 5G. On national television. Wow. How irresponsible can you get. Switching off. Hope Holly and Phil are back soon.”Andy Green said: “Well done Eamonn. You just added more fuel to this 5G conspiracy theory by legitimising what is utter nonsense. You need to research properly before pronouncing.”MPs have called for social media companies to be held to account following reports of phone masts being attacked after the claim spread online.At least 20 phone masts across the UK are believed to have been set alight or vandalised since the start of the pandemic in connection to false 5G claims, according to government and industry sources, who said this month they were increasingly concerned about the impact of the baseless theories.Facebook has since stepped up efforts to stop far-right groups from promoting conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to 5G.Ofcom is assessing comments made by the conspiracist David Icke during an interview broadcast by the local television station London Live, in which he suggested that the coronavirus pandemic was part of a plot by governments to destroy the economy and conduct mass surveillance.The media watchdog previously ruled that a local radio station had breached its rules after one of its guests suggested the Covid-19 outbreak was caused by the rollout of 5G mobile technology.A government spokesman said: “We are aware of a number of attacks on phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. Those responsible for these criminal acts will face the full force of the law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de23c9d8151bd8d9c5493d9d92d5cc7f1ccefcc7/0_8_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5fb0187ebb1880a9d6989a8d14f229a","title":"the early days of home computing in pictures","story":"“There were no design conventions for the earliest home computers, no rules for how they’d look,” says Alex Wiltshire, author of Home Computers, a new book that explores the rapidly changing face of the household machine between its birth in the 1970s and the 1990s.

Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Nick Offerman from Parks and Recreation, the satirical US series about an Indiana town’s parks department in which he played Ron Swanson, the libertarian, anti-government boss striving to make his department as ineffective as possible.Speaking from his home in LA, where he’s under lockdown, Offerman seems as surprised about this career turn as anyone. “Any farm boy like myself, that packed up and went off to theatre school, is chasing the dream of working with a person like Alex,” he says. “I was working at my woodwork shop when I got the call that he wanted to meet with me, and I teared up a little bit. In my world, it was not expected that someone like Alex would turn his gaze in my direction.”Nevertheless, it’s perfect casting. Offerman plays Forest, a conspiratorial tech CEO so ravaged with grief for his dead daughter that he’s built a giant statue of her on the grounds of his campus. Amaya, his quantum computing company, is being investigated by engineer Lily Chan, who believes it is responsible for the disappearance of her boyfriend. Although Forest starts the series as an out-and-out villain (and it’s great to see Offerman use his physical heft for something other than excessive meat consumption), we gradually see a more humane side as we understand the rationale for his time-bending invention.How does he feel about the central theme, the question of whether we live in a deterministic universe? “I love ruminating about the big existential questions,” he says. “But I was brought up in a family of salt-of-the-earth public servants, in the middle of Illinois, in the middle of America. I can wrap my head around the science of determinism, but in my everyday life, it’s the last thing I can think about because I’m usually in the middle of choosing the sandwich I’ll be having for lunch – and then the slightly larger, warmer sandwich I’ll be having for dinner.”It’s a very Offerman answer, rooted in both good-hearted Americana and food. Time and time again during our interview, he’ll return to these twin wells, bringing up the morals that were instilled in him by his family and comparing TV reviews to various types of fast food (“Who put gruyere in this cheeseburger? Are you insane? One star!”).Offerman, 49, was born in the tiny village of Minooka to a mother who was a nurse and a father who taught social studies at high school. He’s one of four children and much of his growing up was done on a soybean farm, which is just the sort of quirky background detail that could belong to his most famous character. In fact, if you close your eyes, you feel like you could be talking to Ron Swanson. And this might be becoming a problem.Although Parks and Recreation finished half a decade ago, people still have a tendency to see Offerman through the lens of Swanson. It’s understandable – the character incorporated many of Offerman’s traits: his flair for woodwork, his talent with a saxophone and his outward projection of gruff manliness. It’s a comparison that Offerman has played up, with books like Paddle Your Own Canoe and a standup tour called American Ham. But enough is enough. On his most recent comedy tour, Offerman took to singing a song entitled I’m Not Ron Swanson, which contained the lines: “He can eat a big-ass steak for every single meal  ’Cause his colon is fictitious, while mine is all too real.”Was the song born of frustration? “It’s a little complicated,” he says, “because people want to conflate me with Ron Swanson’s politics. He’s a staunch libertarian, and I’m interested in everybody having healthcare or being paid a living wage. When I used to look at social media more closely, there would be angry fans saying, ‘I brought my shotgun to your comedy show and it turns out you’re a total snowflake.’”In truth, the two are poles apart. Offerman took two semesters of ballet. He toured Japan doing kabuki theatre. He repeatedly refers to himself as the black sheep of the family, who cries easily and believes Yoko Ono is a misunderstood genius. He’s thoughtful and articulate on gender and race, and very concerned with the issue of sustainable food.There were other downsides to playing Swanson, too. “I couldn’t go to a restaurant. No matter what I ordered, they would put an inch-thick layer of bacon on my plate. I’d order a cheeseburger and they’d make me a one-pound cheeseburger. And I would give them a thumbs-up and hear my cardiologist screaming in my head.”Yet there have always been many sides to Offerman. As well as the tours, the books (four in seven years), his parallel career running a woodshop in LA, and the intimate podcast he and his wife Megan Mullally host from their bed, Offerman has amassed a wildly varied filmography. There has been voice work in Ice Age and Lego movies, prestigious Oscar bait in the form of The Founder, and such heartfelt little indie films as 2018’s Hearts Beat Loud. Then there are TV appearances in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Will \u0026amp Grace and Fargo.“I come from theatre,” he says, referring to Defiant Theater, the experimental Chicago company he co-founded in the early 1990s, winning rave reviews for productions that included everything from Shakespeare to Stephen King. “When you’re a street theatre actor, that means you try to perform in a myriad of genres. Whatever’s on that season. So you might do a Sam Shepard play, then maybe a musical. I have a lot of experience on stage of making people laugh certainly – but also making people cringe, vomit and sob.”Yet Devs feels like his greatest leap so far. It’s a tremendous performance that sees Offerman shuttling between menace, vulnerability, goofiness and outright terror. Perhaps most impressive is the way that, as of a character who can see the future and therefore can never be surprised, he’s able to give such a relatable human performance. Given its themes, the show is bound to alienate as many people as it beguiles – something Offerman seems fully aware of.This does not seem like a particularly optimal time to be promoting a TV series, with the world gripped by coronavirus. Does it feel strange? “Well, it does,” he says. “I mean, everything is kind of strange. For those of us whose work involves outputting any sort of content to an audience, everything has to be couched with sensitivity to the tragedy unfolding all around us.“Fortunately, the greater percentage of us will get through this. A lot of people are suffering and perishing at the hands of the deadly virus. But there are exponentially more people suffering and dying because of the incredible bed-shitting that our administration has performed. The failure – the face-plant of our government in the face of this pandemic – has been unbelievably embarrassing and shameful. And continues to be so. I mean, that sad clown just continues to dance and bleat as though the stock market will somehow save him from the incredibly gory butcher’s bill he is being presented with.”He takes a breath. “But to answer your question, I’m glad – because I think our show is just magnificent.”Offerman is a reassuring man to talk to in a crisis. There’s a lot of solace to be had in his mixture of political fury and good-natured idealism. “As an eternal optimist,” he says, “my hope is that something might come out of this time of reflection, where we’re all being made to hold still for a while. Perhaps when it’s over, we will walk outside and look at a tree, or reacquaint ourselves with squirrels and birds in our neighbourhood, and say, ‘Oh, there is beauty, there is worth, there is incredible value to the world and to life. And it doesn’t come through my phone, it doesn’t come through consumerism, it doesn’t come from capitalism.’”Another deep breath. “I had the good fortune of growing up in a frugal and loving family, so I understood that we can have a beautiful and rewarding life without having three Porsches in the garage. Having three Porsches is not actually that great, because you have to pay to maintain three Porsches. But if you instead get together with your family and build a canoe or a rowboat, you only need one of those. And you can have fun all year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc8555a0cce7175507dfa26392c868e4a0a73ef/0_175_5300_3182/master/5300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee79b4c58776346351989d192ec9bb6c","title":"bernie sanders endorses joe biden for president","story":"Bernie Sanders endorsed his former rival Joe Biden for president on Monday, during a surprise appearance on a live stream related to the US response to the coronavirus pandemic.Sanders’ support of the former vice-president comes at a critical moment in the 2020 campaign, as Biden attempts to unify the party after a fiercely contested primary. By throwing his weight behind Biden, Sanders, is sending a clear signal to his legions of loyal followers that they should align behind the party’s nominee to defeat Donald Trump.“Today, I am asking all Americans, I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,” the senator from Vermont said, appearing via live stream on a split screen next to Biden, who was hosting the broadcast.“We need you in the White House,” Sanders said. “We’ve got to make Trump a one-term president. I will do all that I can to make that happen.”Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary race last week after falling far behind Biden in the delegate count. In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, he will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates.Biden, a former Delaware senator and vice-president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, thanked Sanders for his support.“You’ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America,” Biden told Sanders. “You don’t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.”“If I am the nominee – which it looks like now you just made me – I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern,” Biden told Sanders.Biden still faces deep skepticism from young progressive voters, many of whom supported Sanders by lopsided margins. On Monday, Biden and Sanders announced that their staff had set up six taskforces to help find common ground on policy differences. Those groups will cover the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration, climate change and healthcare.“It’s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences. And we’re not going to paper them over, that’s real,” Sanders said. But he expressed an optimism that the working groups would be able to forge policy agreements and concessions.Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify, Biden has already started to ramp up his outreach to the party’s left. In recent weeks, he has engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice.He has also made overt gestures, adopting a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system, embracing elements of Sanders’ tuition-free college proposal and unveiling a plan to lower the age of eligibility for the Medicare government health insurance program for seniors from 65 to 60.Though there are indications Biden will continue to move left on issues like climate change, he is unlikely to adopt Medicare for All, Sanders’ signature policy. Asked recently if the coronavirus outbreak changed his position on universal healthcare, Biden said it hadn’t and argued expanding the Affordable Care Act was still the most effective and efficient way to insure more Americans.In a sign of the work that lies ahead, the progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Sanders’ most high-profile surrogates, called Biden’s Medicare proposal “almost insulting” and said he would have to go much further if he expects a full-throated endorsement.“The whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved – that’s how you know it’s working,” she said in an interview with the New York Times. “And if Biden is only doing things he’s comfortable with, then it’s not enough.”There are also limits to Sanders’ ability to deliver the support of his devoted followers, particularly those attracted to his outsider status as an independent railing against the political establishment. Though Sanders has been careful not to attack Biden in personal terms, some of his most visible backers continue to assail the former vice-president, raising questions about his mental acuity and overall fitness – a line of attack that Trump has also used against his likely opponent.Despite a hard-fought primary, the former competitors and one-time Senate colleagues displayed sincere affection for one another – a warm relationship Sanders never shared with his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.“I appreciate your friendship, and I promise you I will not let you down,” Biden told Sanders.In reply, Sanders said: “I know you are the kind of guy who is going to be inclusive. You want to bring people in – even people who disagree with you.”After exchanging questions on raising the minimum wage, and the US economy, they joked that they should end the live-cast by playing a game of chess.“We’ll bore everybody for a few hours,” Sanders said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f51afe3fc58ff6fb161ad60419b16845457030/0_290_6095_3656/master/6095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9f74c49ffe033221811530d470cb39","title":"a chance to do something meaningful the refugee chefs feeding health workers","story":"Despite facing personal hardship, a team of refugees has been delivering food to hospital staff in Malaysia’s capital during the coronavirus outbreakIn a small shop-turned-kitchen on the ground floor of a block of flats in Kuala Lumpur, Mohammad Jaber, 60, is preparing a feast: 20 portions of bechamel macaroni with minced chicken and lentil soup, accompanied by basbousa, a traditional semolina sweet cake he and his family often ate back in Syria before they fled to Malaysia in 2012.“We have so many desserts in Syria, but Malaysians seem to like basbousa the most,” his 21-year-old son, Tarek Jaber, says.Cooking is what Mohammad Jaber does. For almost 30 years before war broke out in Syria, he ran a restaurant in Damascus. Since 2013, he has been catering for restaurants and private events out of this small kitchen in Kuala Lumpur’s Taman Melati neighbourhood.Now though, Mohammad and his assistant Mahmoud Mohammed Salad, a 22-year-old Somalian, are feeding a different community: frontline health workers at the Ampang hospital, a public healthcare facility in the Malaysian capital. They are part of a group of 15 refugees from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan who have joined forces to feed those on the frontline of the Covid-19 crisis. Here, cases have risen above 4,000, and 70 deaths have been recorded.Three weeks ago when the Malaysian government imposed a movement control order prohibiting the operation of all but essential services, two advocacy groups, the Syrian Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and Malaysian Beyond Borders Malaysia, put a call out to members of their community to form a refugee kitchen.The response was immediate and overwhelming. “Just on the same day, 10 chefs came forward. We said we had nothing to pay them, but they said they wanted to help,” says Hasan Al-Akraa who founded the Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and launched the refugee kitchen with Malaysian film-maker Mahi Ramakrishnan.“In the end, Mahi and I raised some funds and gave each of them enough for two days of groceries. They have responsibilities and children to feed.” They have now cooked more than 400 meals for nurses and doctors and other frontline staff since they opened their kitchen on 23 March.The first time he took part, Jaber – who now cooks wearing gloves and a protective face mask – made mandi chicken with rice, a popular Arabic staple.“My father feels it is his duty to provide services for the people of Malaysia who have been affected by this difficult situation,” Tarek says as his father stirs saucepans in the kitchen.The refugee chefs – 12 women and three men – start cooking in the morning and have the food ready by 11am. A volunteer or hired driver picks it up and takes it to the health workers at the hospital. Al-Akraa helps to coordinate all this from his room at Nottingham University’s Malaysia campus, or even while out running errands.Like Mohammad, Al-Akraa arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Syria in 2012, with his parents and four siblings. When he was 14, while trying to help his family, he was arrested by the Malaysian authorities for working at a restaurant without a permit. Although the Malaysian government works with NGOs to provide some assistance for refugees, it does not recognise them legally, meaning they have limited opportunities to study and work.In detention for nine days, Al-Akraa met three Rohingya refugees who inspired him to start helping others when he was free. “I told myself I shouldn’t be complaining. At least I have a UNHCR refugee card, so I would be released, but they came by boat and didn’t have any documentation.”At the refugee kitchen, the chefs rotate every day, and next on the rota is 43-year-old Elham Jaber Jasim Musawi. She prepares chicken macaroni – which she often cooks for her kids – with the help of her husband, Hussam Kadhim Younes Al Mohammedawi. Her 14-year-old son, Danial Husam Kadhim, had helped her with the shopping the day before.Musawi left Baghdad with her husband and children in 2014 when Islamic State escalated its attacks in her country. Now they live in a three-bedroom flat in Kuala Lumpur’s Ampang neighbourhood. Lockdown has been hard for the family. The children watch TV and play football indoors to pass the time and Musawi is worried that the family won’t be able to pay their rent. Both her job at a local school and that of her husband have been affected by the restrictions on movement.Still, she is happy to help. “This is an opportunity I wouldn’t have passed up for anything. It’s not always that we get a chance to do something meaningful. We are all thankful to the doctors and all other medical workers who sacrifice their lives to keep us safe,” she says.The food is gratefully received by the nurses and doctors.“Even though they’re not from our country, they want to help us while we carry out our work,” says Shuhaida Shuib, 42, a nurse at Ampang hospital. “I think that’s very compassionate and it means a lot in these difficult times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb04114fe4a9443e2a7f3abc4fa79bfc039eb29/95_377_2968_1781/master/2968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9890b138be3dc436c6fc783f834b57ca","title":"britain on target for 100000 coronavirus tests a day says no 10","story":"Figures show less than a fifth of target figure for coronavirus tests are being carried outDowning Street has insisted it remains on target to ensure 100,000 tests a day for coronavirus by the end of the month – despite the latest figures showing only a fifth of this number are being carried out.At the daily briefing for lobby journalists, the prime minister’s spokesman disclosed the statistics while defending the decision to allow Michael Gove’s daughter to be tested for the illness – at a time when some NHS and care home staff are still waiting to be tested themselves.The test came back negative, meaning that Gove was no longer obliged to self-isolate at home with the rest of his family. The fact that Gove was no longer self-isolating emerged when he was seen jogging in a park near his London home.On 25 March, at the last prime minister’s questions before the Easter recess , Boris Johnson told MPs that the government was “massively increasing” testing up to 25,000 per day. Later that day he told a press conference that “hopefully very soon” he wanted to reach a target of 250,000 tests a day, although when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, set a formal target to be achieved by the end of April, he settled on 100,000 tests a day.At the Monday briefing, the PM’s spokesman said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 18,000 tests were carried out in Great Britain.He said that 2,630 of those tests involved NHS staff being tested at drive-through sites, and that a total of 42,812 NHS staff and their family members had now been tested.That marked “significant progress on where we were a little over a week ago”, the spokesman claimed.When it was put to him that the government was still a long way off the 100,000-a-day target set by Hancock, the spokesman said he did not accept that. “New capacity is coming on stream all the time,” he said, stressing that there were now 23 drive-through centres open where NHS staff could get tested.It also emerged that Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, had arranged for his daughter to be tested after she developed coronavirus symptoms. The test came back negative, meaning that Gove was no longer obliged to self-isolate at home with the rest of his family.The spokesman said this had been done on the advice of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and was justified on the grounds that Gove was one of the figures leading the government’s response to coronavirus.Asked why Gove could not work from home, the spokesman said Gove chaired one of the key ministerial groups dealing with coronavirus (one covering the public sector) and it was “beneficial” for him to be able to go into the office.At the briefing it also emerged that the cabinet as a whole may not be involved in the decision, due to be formally taken this week, to extend the lockdown announced by Johnson exactly three weeks ago.Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for this week. With Johnson recovering at Chequers after his spell in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is deputising in his absence. The spokesman said the main work coordinating the government’s response to coronavirus was being done by the morning No 10 meeting, chaired by Raab, and by the four coronavirus ministerial groups.It is seen as inevitable that the lockdown will be extended, and No 10 said the reasoning would be formally explained when the decision is formally announced, which has to be by Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fad2437d63d944763052e7a23768b15434defb/494_325_4956_2974/master/4956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5b3e526fc5c2f9f171ede726f142c0","title":"raab suggests uk lockdown could last at least another month","story":"PM’s deputy backs chief scientific adviser, saying public must stay in until peak has passedPeople in Britain have been warned that there is “a long way to go” before lockdown measures to curb the spread of coronavirus are likely to be relaxed, with the UK’s chief scientific adviser suggesting they could last another month.As the country entered its fourth week of rules compelling the public to stay at home except for essential work, shopping or exercise, Sir Patrick Vallance said he expected the number of deaths from coronavirus to continue rising this week before hitting a plateau that could last up to three weeks.Only when the UK was “firmly on the other side” would it be safe to relax some of the restrictions, Vallance told the the daily Downing Street press briefing, implying that the lockdown measures in place could easily last another month.His comments, coming three weeks after Boris Johnson announced a lockdown, were backed by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who said it was “absolutely crucially important” not to let up at this point.Raab, who is deputising for the prime minister while he recovers at Chequers from the Covid-19 infection that led to him spending a week in hospital, said he spoke to Johnson on Saturday.When the prime minister announced the lockdown on 23 March, he said it would be reviewed after three weeks. However, ministers are now looking at proposals that would involve the restrictions being removed gradually, with some of the physical distancing measures possibly being maintained for many months.The World Health Organization said on Monday that restrictions should be lifted slowly and not “all at once” to avoid a resurgence of the virus, and only if appropriate measures are in place, including “significant” capacity for contact tracing.The government must decide by Thursday this week whether to renew the three-week lockdown period. Raab said a formal decision on how to ease the lockdown would be taken after ministers had received evidence from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage).He said: “We don’t expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won’t until we’re confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made.”The final decision would be signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting attended by the heads of the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who are expected to back the approach adopted by Westminster.On Monday the Department of Health and Social Care said 11,329 hospital patients in the UK had now died from coronavirus, up 717 from the previous day’s total. The total number of coronavirus deaths is higher because the daily figure does not include deaths in care homes or private homes the Office for National Statistics will release non-hospital deaths on Tuesday.Vallance said there would be a further increase in the death rate. He went on: “Thereafter we should see a plateau as the effects of social distancing come through. That plateau may last for some time and begin to decrease.” Asked what he meant by “some time”, he said the plateau could last for “two or three weeks”.He said if the lockdown measures were relaxed too early there was a danger that the infection rate could shoot back up. “We’ll look and see where the peak is and when we are firmly the other side of it in terms of numbers coming down,” Vallance said.“Only at that stage do you start looking at what measures might be released and how they might be released. It would be a complete waste of everything that everyone has had to do until now … if we were to rapidly reverse that and lead to a re-emergence of this.”Making the same point, Raab said: “We’ve still got a long way to go … We’ve still not passed the peak of this virus.”The foreign secretary added: “It’s absolutely crucially important that we do not take our eye off the ball or the public’s focus on the thing that has been a success so far in relative terms – which is our ability through widespread support for our social distancing measures to deprive this virus of the means to spread.”Earlier it emerged that the cabinet as a whole may not be involved in the formal decision to extend the lockdown, and for how long.Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for this week, the prime minister’s spokesman told the daily lobby briefing. He said the main work coordinating the government’s response to coronavirus was being done at the regular morning No 10 meeting, which is attended by a small number of senior ministers and is referred to as the “war cabinet’” by officials.Raab is chairing it in the prime minister’s absence. Other key decisions are being taken by the four coronavirus ministerial groups, the spokesman said.Johnson left St Thomas’ hospital in London on Sunday after a week as an inpatient including three nights in intensive care. There was a 48-hour period when things “could have gone either way”, he said of his treatment.He is recuperating at Chequers in Buckinghamshire – the official retreat for serving prime ministers – where he has been reunited with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds.

The EU is separately establishing stockpiles within member states, with the first being set up in Romania.The development comes as anger grows over PPE shortages in Britain, with particular concerns at the weekend over stocks of full-sleeve gowns running out. The gowns are designed to resist droplets which can spread coronavirus and were shown to be highly effective at protecting medics in Italy.On Monday Dominic Raab, acknowledged PPE shortages – rather than distribution issues only – for the first time.The foreign secretary, who is deputising for the prime minister as Boris Johnson recovers from Covid-19, told the daily Downing Street briefing that cost was not an issue but admitted to problems with PPE supply due to “a competitive market out there”.He declined to apologise, saying only that 16m items of equipment were delivered over the bank holiday weekend. “We are straining every sinew to roll them out even further and even faster,” he said.The UK government has previously said it was unable to join the EU’s procurement schemes as it had not received an email of invitation.As a result, the government missed out on mass procurement of medical ventilators, and has called on UK manufacturers to build tens of thousands more. But it has also not been involved in two rounds of bulk purchasing of PPE, which were launched by the EU on 28 February and 17 March.The EU’s procurement of 28 February initially failed due to a lack of interest from suppliers but was relaunched on 15 March, providing additional time for the UK to get involved if it had chosen to do so.It is understood that officials in Whitehall only realised after those three rounds had been put out to tender that they had not received invitations to join the Joint Procurement Agreement steering committee where the orders are organised.The UK only took part in its first meeting on joint procurement on 19 March after informing the commission that emails of invitation were being sent to an outdated address, the  has learned.Despite that belated show of interest, British officials did not attend a separate meeting of health officials on 25 March where participants were invited to spell out their requirements for future purchases to the commission by the next day.The UK is also not involved in joint procurement of laboratory equipment. The EU is also planning joint procurement of therapies for coronavirus, but the UK is yet to state its position on its involvement.Shortages of protective equipment have triggered anxiety, alarm and fear among NHS medics and care home staff. The death toll among doctors and nurses continues to rise, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, saying on Saturday that 19 NHS workers had died. He said it was “impossible” to say when hospitals would have all they needed but added: “We aren’t aware of any links from shortages of PPE to any of these deaths.”New examples of the shortage of equipment seen by the  include a district nurse in London being issued with just three disposable masks for a week and a care home nurse in Devon claiming her employer was limiting drinks to every four hours to avoid multiple changes of masks and gloves.The Royal College of Nursing has added to the pressure by advising nurses they should refuse to treat patients with Covid-19 “as a last resort” if they could not access the full PPE they needed.The EU procurement scheme has not been entirely successful, however. While deliveries of masks, gowns and gloves will be made in tranches over the next two to 18 weeks, the procurement of ventilators will be slow, according to a leaked EU document.“Companies indicated long delivery times, from 10 to 52 weeks,” the commission warned member states of the £690m purchase.A spokesman for the commission said: “Some of the equipment, depending on the specifications of the contracts, could be available within a few weeks after member states place orders with the industry. However, taking into account the difficult situation of the market some products require more time to be produced and delivered.“Overall, for the joint procurements launched for personal protective equipment, the commission has received offers for all categories of equipment requested, some even exceeding the amounts requested.

Too many are phoning me to say things they needed were missing or in short supply. Nursing staff are dying from this virus and too many risks are still being run.”The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are working round the clock with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the army to ensure the supply of PPE over the coming weeks and months and will give our NHS and the social care sector everything they need to tackle this pandemic – including working with countries around the globe.“We are also working with a number of firms to scale up production of existing UK ventilator manufacturers, as well as designing and manufacturing new products from scratch, and procuring thousands more machines from overseas.“We will continue to work with European countries and others in order to make sure that we can increase the capacity within the NHS, and we will consider participating in future EU joint procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcb50f96f9cb1688a0e5bde03e055ad01a39f7f/0_335_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98204d01be3322f41330eb8edb21a6fa","title":"uk scraps plans to buy thousands of bluesky ventilators coronavirus","story":"Model by Renault and Red Bull F1 teams found unsuitable for complex treatment of coronavirusA plan to buy thousands of medical ventilators from a group including the Renault and Red Bull Formula One teams has been cancelled amid signs that symptoms specific to Covid-19 could make building new devices more difficult than hoped.The NHS needs to increase its stock of ventilators from 10,000 to at least 18,000 and the government has been scrambling to procure enough in time for a peak of cases expected by the end of the month.Efforts to source more have involved enlisting UK manufacturers, importing devices from overseas and even borrowing them from the set of the BBC medical drama Holby City.The Cabinet Office confirmed that a provisional request for thousands of one model, called BlueSky, would not go ahead because clinicians feared the device was not sufficiently complex to be suitable for treating Covid-19. understands that this ventilator, formerly known as Remora, involved a collaboration between the Renault and Red Bull Formula One teams. They were working with a small Essex-based specialist, Lifeline Technologies, whose founder, Dr Alastair Darwood, designs medical devices.The devices had not been formally ordered or paid for because they were yet to receive regulatory approval.While the BlueSky machine was capable of ventilating patients, clinicians on the government’s technical design authority and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found it was not suited for treating Covid-19.This is because fluid builds up in the lungs of coronavirus patients faster than in people suffering from other ailments. The devices must be switched to a different setting while the patient’s lungs are being cleared and the BlueSky machine did not lend itself to frequent changes.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the decision had been taken “following a reassessment of the product’s viability in light of the ever-developing picture around what is needed to most effectively treat Covid-19”.Formula One teams are assisting with several ventilator projects under the umbrella title Project Pitlane. A spokesperson for Formula One said: “The F1 team project leads for BlueSky – Aston Martin Red Bull Racing and Renault DP World F1 Team – have shown brilliant dedication and skill throughout the project and should feel proud of the work they have undertaken to develop a new device with an NHS entrepreneur and will continue to provide vital contributions to Project Pitlane.”One source familiar with multiple ventilator projects said the issues that affected BlueSky showed why regulators could not rush through new devices.“People are still testing these things in clinical trials and our understanding is evolving every day, so that might be part of why it’s taking a bit longer,” they said.The MHRA approval process can take years but officials are working round the clock to move faster.One device, made by Oxfordshire-based Penlon with backing from manufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce, is expected to win approval soon because it varies only slightly from proven machines.The Ventilator Challenge UK consortium has offered to build 5,000 of these and some have already been delivered to hospitals where doctors are performing clinical trials.The same consortium has also delivered the first of up to 10,000 ParaPAC ventilators made by Luton-based Smiths Medical, which are already approved for use.But tens of thousands of the machines that have won provisional orders from the government are yet to be rubber-stamped.They include 10,000 of the Zephyr Plus model made by the defence firm Babcock and German medical device specialist Drägerwerk. The Zephyr Plus has the advantage of being based on existing designs.Dyson’s brand new CoVent prototype is not thought to have undergone rigorous testing yet, while another device made by a Cambridge-based company called Science Group is also untried."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88169721eb1371193f177d17f59447f97d5015a2/0_173_5199_3119/master/5199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=756ac21cfcd62f236a4d6c9058264840","title":"animal crossing game removed from sale in china over hong kong democracy messages","story":"Some players have used the game to create politically sensitive images and slogans which they share on social mediaThe Nintendo Switch game, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, has been removed from sale on websites in China, after it was used by Hong Kong activists to spread pro-democracy messages.The popular island-life simulation game disappeared from China’s eBay-equivalent, Taobao, last week.The game allows users to decorate their game environment with a pattern creation tool, which some players have used to create politically sensitive images and slogans which they screenshot and share on social media. Some posts related to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and attacked chief executive Carrie Lam, and Chinese president Xi Jinping.High profile activists, Joshua Wong, last week shared a screenshot on Twitter of his own in-game island with a banner reading “Free Hong Kong, revolution now”.“For lots of people around the world who play this game, they have to put their ideal life into the game,” said Wong.“And for Hong Kongers, we have to put our protest movement and our protest sites inside the game.”It’s unclear whether sales were removed under specific direction from the Chinese government, and there has been no official announcement from authorities. Tech news site, Ping West, said a message was sent to sellers on the Alibaba-owned Taobao late on Thursday, ordering a ban on sales of all Animal Crossing products.While the game was not officially available in China, many people bought parallel imported consoles from grey market commerce sites like Taobao.After the game disappeared from Chinese sellers, Wong said users began blaming him.Daniel Ahmad, a gaming analyst and writer, said the removal of Animal Crossing from sales sites was “complicated”, but was essentially the enforcement of a 2017 policy.“Taobao ‘banned’ the sale of imported video game discs and cartridges back in 2017, but this is something that hasn’t really been enforced all that much, only on select games,” he said on Twitter.“The games where this policy has been enforced in the past usually fall under two criteria. One: The game has content or user generated content that is deemed to be too offensive or violent etc. Two: The game has become very popular and caught the attention of regulators.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c289b5915476567fe00fb9fcff95cc57818457a2/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29cc3f296112f0e4d384b5a01c9a3cea","title":"coronavirus latest 14 april at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to Johns Hopkins University figures, 1,920,985 people worldwide are known to have been infected with coronavirus, though the total number of infections is likely higher. So far, 119,687 people have died in the pandemic.In a televised address, the French president said France would start returning to normal life on 11 May, if citizens were “civic, responsible and respected the rules” – and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop. He said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won.As Moscow tightened its lockdown measures, Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet. Russia reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, bringing the overall nationwide tally to 18,328. Eighteen people diagnosed with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 148. In a video conference with officials on Monday, Putin said the next weeks would be “decisive” for Russia’s fight against the virus as the situation “is changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.”China reported 89 new coronavirus cases on 13 April, down from 108 the previous day. China’s state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day’s imported cases were in the northeast province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported 0 new deaths and cases.In a bizarre and antagonistic press briefing that included the airing of a campaign-style video attacking the press and Trump announcing his authority over lockdown rules is “total”, the US president said he will also decide this week whether he plans to reopen the US by 1 May. Payments to iniduals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.A glimmer of hope. Deaths and hospitalisations are falling in New York. “Yes, I think you can say the worst is over,” governor Andrew Cuomo said, announcing an alliance with six other governors in the region to explore how to lift restrictions. “If you do it wrong, it can backfire, and we’ve seen that with other places in the globe,” Cuomo said.Monday’s new cases were lower than the 530 new cases reported by the health ministry on Sunday. The country’s total is 7,645. Japan was put under a state of emergency last week, but many people were still seen queuing up at grocery stores and crowding shopping arcades in parts of downtown Tokyo.The debt relief will be made available under the IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT). About $215 million of the total will be used for grants to the first 25 countries over the next six months, with extensions possible up to two years.

If we put off confronting these problems until the next elections in four years’ time, it will be too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e0c3dbb38ed5e5881742deb1b7bb0f356f66fb/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1269ae259d73140d9e493bcab584f332","title":"south korea votes in first national election of coronavirus era","story":"Widespread approval of President Moon Jae-in’s handling of crisis could boost his party’s chancesRunning for high office in the midst of a pandemic has forced candidates in South Korea to abandon tried and tested campaigning methods, as the country prepares to become the first to hold a national election since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.With a few exceptions, they have swapped handshakes for elbow bumps and delivered speeches from behind masks to small groups rather than hold mass rallies. Kissing babies is out of the question.In less tumultuous times, the 15 April elections would have been dominated by job creation, wages and North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. But they have been overshadowed by president Moon Jae-in’s response to the pandemic.Early indications are that the virus has failed to deter voters, with predictions of a record turnout by the time all the votes for the 300-seat national assembly have been cast on Wednesday evening. On Friday, more than 5 million people cast their ballots early – a record high since advance voting was introduced seven years ago.Like millions of his compatriots, Moon arrived at a polling station wearing a mask, and was not allowed to vote until he had passed a temperature test, washed his hands and put on plastic gloves.“In times of a national disaster or crisis, the ruling camp would usually be on the defensive. But the recent slowing of the outbreak appears to have turned the tide in their favour,” said Yang Seung-ham, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul.South Korea has brought daily known infections to about 50 or below, down from the late February peak of more than 900, through a combination of aggressive testing, monitoring, social distancing and strict quarantine for overseas arrivals. It has had a total of 10,537 cases, with 217 deaths, as of the afternoon of Monday 13 April, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Well over 7,000 infected people have recovered from the illness.“We were terrified several weeks ago, but thanks to the government’s handling of the coronavirus, we think we will do much better than we had previously thought,” a senior ruling party official said.The virus has transformed the mechanics of voting for millions of South Koreans amid concern that polling stations could trigger a second wave of infections, just as the country appears to be bringing the outbreak under control.More than 3,500 polling stations have been disinfected and all voters are required to use hand sanitiser and wear a mask and gloves. Those who fail a temperature check are directed to special booths, while separate polling stations have been set up for more than 3,000 Covid-19 patients and 900 medical workers in Seoul and the city of Daegu, until recently the centre of South Korea’s infections. People in quarantine will be allowed to vote by mail from home.Many voters agreed that the elections should go ahead, even if it meant longer waits outside polling stations.“As long as people take all the necessary precautions, the elections should go ahead,” said Jeon Young-gyun, a 55-year-old resident of Suwon in Gyeonggi province. “Voting is the best way to protect democracy … it’s our right as citizens.”But Lee Yong-joo, a 79-year-old voter from Seoul, was having second thoughts. “I have voted all my life so I hope to do the same this week, but I’m afraid about going out these days,” she said. “The number of infections is falling, but the mortality rate among older people is still worrying so I’m not sure if I should risk it.”Some were critical of parties for turning the campaign into a bidding war, with rival offers of cash payouts for voters whose livelihoods have been ruined by the outbreak.“The candidates should stop exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to win votes,” said Park Seon-min, a young voter in the capital who was appalled to see some candidates hugging voters and shouting political slogans despite not wearing a mask.“The parties are offering different compensation packages, and it’s not good to see. I’ve lost my teaching job because of the outbreak, but the politicians are going to be fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4675573b1b2dc2cf14cc98b17aefc9ebd0259f81/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49a0195212b231e2ab6bf98135c72157","title":"tuesday briefing a long way to go in lockdown","story":"‘Crucially important’ to keep up measures says Raab … Sanders endorses Biden as Democratic candidate … man accidentally ejects from fighter jetHello, Warren Murray here, pleased to be delivering the Briefing once again after our Easter hiatus.People in Britain have been warned that there is “a long way to go” before lockdown measures are likely to be relaxed, with the government and its chief scientific adviser suggesting they could last another month.

The president delivered a bizarre performance in which he played a campaign video produced by White House staff – in a possible violation of election laws – that consisted of Fox News clips praising his response. Trump’s assertion of sweeping powers over the states has been rejected by legal analysts as a gross misreading of the US constitution, which assures the states of autonomy.

The conclusions clash with complaints of ex-Labour whistleblowers who said there was political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn. Plans to submit the report to an Equalities and Human Rights Commission inquiry have been scrapped. The previous Labour leadership’s handling of antisemitism allegations overshadowed parts of the 2019 election campaign.Sienna Rodgers, editor of LabourList, writes that the leak inflames factional warfare just as Starmer seeks to unite the party.Fires nearing Chernobyl – Wildfires in Ukraine have spread to just over a mile from the Chernobyl power plant, according to activists. Ukraine’s emergency services agency said 310 firefighters and dozens of fire trucks, as well as three aircraft and three helicopters, had been sent in. A Chernobyl tour operator, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, wrote that the fire had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat: “The situation is critical. The zone is burning.” Ukraine’s emergency services said the fire was “difficult” but called for calm and urged people not to listen to “apocalyptic messages … The main thing we can say is that there is no threat to the nuclear power station, the spent fuel storage, and to other critical sites in the exclusion zone.” Chernobyl is the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history.‘Need you in the White House’ – Bernie Sanders has endorsed his former rival Joe Biden for president.

But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. The bits of the economy that do continue to function rely on credit to pay costs and wages. Meanwhile millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit too.What Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. During major crises, we are reminded that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited – and the last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system by the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish have aimed stinging criticism at British Cycling, the sport’s national governing body, in a Q\u0026ampA session on Instagram.

The 12 men were arrested, but were released without charge.Emily remains adamant she told the truthand tells ITV news anchor Julie Etchingham that local police forced her to retract her rape claim.She said: “There was no other way out of that police station other than sign that retraction statement.“I thought as soon as I am outside that volatile environment I can sort this out. When you’re in that situation the only sensible thing to do is to conform.”She was immediately charged with “public mischief” by the police for allegedly giving a false statement and spent about a month in prison before being granted bail in August.On 7 January, she was handed a four-month jail term, suspended for three years, before returning to the UK that week.She has since lodged an appeal against her public mischief conviction to Cyprus’s supreme court. The 12 men were released without charge.The documentary will be a chance for Emily’s friends, who found her shortly after the alleged rape, to tell their stories for the first time.The programme will explore “inconsistencies in the suspects’ account” of that night, with a former Home Office adviser re-examining the evidence.Former DCI David Gee told the programme that if the alleged events had occurred in the UK, there appeared to be enough evidence to charge at least one man with rape.Believe Me – the Cyprus Rape Case airs on ITV on Tuesday at 10.45pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

It was then that she had an idea about organising a community clap for NHS workers after seeing something similar in her home country of the Netherlands. Now, every Thursday at 8pm, millions of people head out into the streets to clap and cheer for the people risking their lives on the frontline. She tells Anushka Asthana how one idea became a national outpouring.  The crisis is bringing people together in other ways too. Naveed Khan is using a customised vehicle to deliver food and supplies to vulnerable people across his home city of Bradford. Lucy Welling, an NHS nurse, had her bike stolen as Britain went into lockdown. But followers on social media rallied round and helped find the bike amid several offers of a new one. The episode inspired a new movement, #TourDeThanks, to offer up bikes to key workers. In Nunhead, south London, Claire Sheppard set up Nunhead Knocks to help out those living in isolation. In Sheffield, 23-year-old Sarah-Jane Clark is one of a number of colleagues who moved in to a care home to look after residents safely.

Photograph: iStockWith schools and colleges shut, teachers and students are exploring an array of digital platforms to engage with learning. And many are finding that podcasts are ideal for students to access support to material taught in school and for teachers to access continuous professional development (CPD).Professionals from all areas of education have made or contributed to podcasts that cover any number of subject areas and teaching strategies: familiarity, it seems, has bred content. We’ve scoured the internet for the most interesting and engaging of the lot: here’s our guide to some of the best:Inside EducationPresented by primary teacher Seán Delaney, a new episode is published weekly giving an Irish perspective on education. It covers a comprehensive list of topics and is the crème de la casts when it comes to education.Listeners can choose from almost 400 episodes on topics that range from leadership in education, literacy, to European education and psychology.Other episodes dole out practical advice on school tour preparation, the dreaded inspector and debates the merits-or lack of- of homework. The episodes vary in length with some breaking the hour mark, but most are at the aurally appealing length of 30 minutes or under.The Learning Scientists PodcastThis US podcast is aimed at teachers and students throughout all areas of education. It discusses evidence- based practice and learning, by examining cognitive psychology and its application in education.Each episode deals with one strategy that might be helpful to students, including retrieval practice, dual-coding, spaced practice and concrete examples.The episode on retrieval practice might be of interest to students looking to fine tune their study habits as they prepare for exam season.Another episode on literacy and making mistakes, identifies the positive role mistakes play in a students’ learning along with some of the mistakes teachers can make when teaching literacy.The episodes vary in length from 10-30 minutes long. There is an accompanying website where listeners can also download a poster related to the strategy discussed along with other support materials.The Hamlet PodcastIt will come as no surprise that there are a multitude of podcasts available on all things Shakespeare, but The Hamlet Podcast, created by theatre and opera director Conor Hanratty, stands out for several reasons.Hanratty has mastered the magic of three: content, analysis and brevity. The 10-minute episodes are long enough to give you an understanding and short enough to keep you engaged and coming back. There is also a distinct lack of gimmick as he lets Shakespeare’s language do the talking.Hanratty was inspired by Frank Delaney’s podcast on Ulysses. “It’s called “Re:Joyce” and it attempted to unpack and unlock the novel in about seven years’ worth of five-minute episodes. Sadly, Frank died before it was completed - a real tragedy,” says Hanratty.In his podcast, Hanratty ides Hamlet into segments of about 20 lines for what he expects to be about 200 episodes and it is listened to by teachers and students alike.The Knowledge ProjectThis podcast offers a veritable buffet of food for educational thought. Each episode discusses theories and interventions that may challenge, support or change educational practices.The discussion-based format explores topics such as memorisation, neuroscience, and empathic approaches to discipline.Trialled and Tested: evidence-based educationTrialled and Tested is a UK based podcast with evidence-based education as its focus. One recent episode examines the impact social and emotional learning in primary school can have on a student’s academic performance as well as the positive impact it has on mental health and wellbeing.Tes - the education podcastStaying with the UK, the Tes podcast has over 400 episodes for teachers from all areas of education. While some of the episodes are aimed specifically towards those teaching in the UK, most episodes have a broad appeal.There are also some useful episodes for newly qualified teachers on the highs and lows of your first year of teaching or advice on how to update your CV.Playing with Research in Health and Physical EducationThis American podcast is aimed at teachers interested in health and physical education.It discusses research on topics such as physical literacy, game sense and use of technology in PE. The show also looks at the PE curriculums from a variety of countries, including Norway, Canada and Australia.One of the more recent episodes discussed the Irish Primary PE curriculum and may be of interest to teachers wishing to learn more about the proposals in the new primary curriculum framework.The Critter ShedThe nature-based podcast describes itself as a ‘podcast with legs’ and while its content’s appeal is not limited to those working in a classroom, it will be of interest to teachers with an interest in bioersity and wishing to upskill themselves on all things creepy crawlie.The episodes are presented by Collie Ennis, a science research associate with Trinity College Dublin and Colette Kinsella.Pol-Soc PodcastJerome Devitt, teacher of Politics and Society, has created a podcast that includes the student voice. Each episode deals with topics from Brexit to the Council of Europe. Devitt started the podcast as a resource for teachers and students starting out with the new subject.“It was a brand-new subject and there were very few resources for teachers and students themselves to use, so part of it was to create a community if knowledge that we would all share,” says Devitt. Student voice and gender balance are observed in each episode.“I wanted to have gender balance because we teach patriarchy and gender equality as part of the course,” says Devitt. The podcast can also be used by students who considering taking the subject.“If students are unsure about a new subject and they listen in to a podcast it maybe helps them make an informed decision about whether they want to do it or not,” says Devitt, “ It gives them a little snippet of it ideas it will deal with.”PIY-Podcast it YourselfElaine Smith, freelance broadcast journalist, teaches a course on podcasting for teachers and has some advice for those interested in making their own podcast to help fellow teachers or students access content without adding to screen time during the remote learning experience.“Podcasts can be introduced to the classroom in a number of ways,” says Smith. Teachers who have already completed a course can publish their own podcast. “Teachers could create episodes with content on the crucial parts of exams or even provide a podcast with key notes on particular modules,” says Smith.She says that podcasts can be the change that gives the students the break. “It’s a quick an easy way for kids to access educational content and is a break from the books. Maybe a popular podcaster has a guest or has an episode which relates to a topic in class, this may encourage pupils to learn from a different source,” says Smith.Teachers who are familiar with skills involved in creating and publishing podcasts can teach the techniques to their students. “As a result, they are learning how to create content based on their classwork,” says Smith."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Concerns about the health impact of 5G have dogged its rollout from the start. Photograph: Justin SetterfieldGettyThe Communications Regulator has urged people to ignore misinformation linking coronavirus to 5G mobile networks following a large increase in the spread of the conspiracy theory in Ireland.Two mobile phone masts were set on fire in Letterkenny, Co Donegal, on Sunday night. Gardaí suspect the fires were set deliberately by arsonists who believe the technology is linked to the virus.Theories falsely claiming coronavirus is caused or spread by the ultrafast wireless technology, or that the Government has imposed the current lockdown to allow for the mass installation of 5G infrastructure, have been widely circulating on Irish social media and through WhatsApp messages in recent weeks.The Donegal masts were actually 4G infrastructure which were being upgraded to provide extra coverage to Letterkenny General Hospital the surrounding areas.HarassmentIn the UK, authorities have reported 30 incidents of arson or vandalism of mobile technology and 80 incidents of harassment of mobile telecoms workers since the conspiracy theory began to gain traction.Researchers in DCU have noticed a massive increase in the conspiracy theory and its variations being spread on Irish social networks.Rollout of 5G technology by Eir and Vodafone began last year in Ireland. It allows for much faster and more reliable internet speeds than the current 4G technology.Concerns about the health impact of 5G have plagued its rollout from the start despite assurances from the expert bodies such as the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection that the radiation it emits falls well below the amount which could pose a health risk.The Communications Regulator (ComReg), which oversees internet and mobile infrastructure in Ireland, regularly receives queries from the public about the safety of 5G.In recent weeks, some of these queries have alleged a link between 5G and coronavirus and Covid-19, its public affairs manager Tom Butler said.The European Commission and the World Health Organisation have said there is “absolutely no truth of a link between Covid-19 and 5G. The Department of Health has advised that coronavirus is spread in sneeze or cough droplets and that there is no evidence of a link to 5G”, Mr Butler said.“In fact, as the World Health Organisation and others have said, there are no anticipated consequences for public health from 5G as long as exposure levels remain within international guidelines.“Compliance with these guidelines is a legal requirement in Ireland and exposure levels are monitored by ComReg,” he said.InfrastructureMr Butler said ComReg is “urging everyone to ignore misinformation circulating on social media and to rely on reputable sources of information about 5G.”He also condemned the incident in Donegal.“Continuity of telecommunications networks services – fixed and mobile – are vital to society, especially at a time when we are advised to stay at home due to Covid-19.“Vandalising mobile phone mast infrastructure will stop masts from carrying mobile call and data services at a time when people are relying on these critical services.“Some people will be unable to contact emergency services and the gardaí. It will also make it harder for people to make contact with their families, friends and work colleagues.”Vodafone Ireland said it has not increased its installation of 5G since the lockdown. Eir declined to comment.ComReg said instead of installing new infrastructure, providers are mainly focusing on maintaining existing networks which are under unprecedented strain due the number of people working from home.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026euro1.5 million suspected to have been laundered into Irish bank accountTest results backlog reduced from about 35,000 people to some 11,000, says HSESome restrictions may be eased on May 5th but social distancing to remain until vaccine found, says MinisterConsultants\u0026rsquo body and Government yet to agree on terms for work in the public systemSinn F\u0026eacutein TD Dessie Ellis notes marked increase in dealing in Finglas and Ballymun\u0026lsquoNow when I need some help I don\u0026rsquot get it because of my age,\u0026rsquo says laid-off hotel worker (68)Borrowers will not be charged interest for the period of the breakTownmore construction says Government must not halt essential infrastructure projectsPeople urged to ignore misinformation linking coronavirus to 5G technologyCouncil properties awaiting refurbishment used to house families in needDocument said to be light on specific policies and is \u0026lsquodesigned to be inviting\u0026rsquo for other partiesOfficials record 527 new confirmed cases while HSE insists testing backlog will be clearedFigures released each day do not include deaths that occur outside of hospitalsFiona Whelan (35) died following accident outside her house on Saturday afternoonIHCA says updated contract does not include agreed provisions for continuity of careUnion issues \u0026lsquoclarification\u0026rsquo saying teachers cannot be forced to work on July exams planGas cylinder, broken lawnmower, wood and furniture were among the latest findsWHO says \u0026lsquoecological research\u0026rsquo on BCG and coronavirus \u0026lsquoprone to significant bias\u0026rsquoMinister says social distancing will be in force until vaccine available but restrictions may be \u0026lsquotweaked\u0026rsquo after May 5thHPSC says clusters of cases detected in 140 nursing homes and 58 hospitals as of April 10thStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228029.1586801849!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why do people spread the 5g conspiracy theory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGarda forensics officer at the scene of the fire at a telecommunications  mast near Letterkenny hospital. Photograph: North West NewspixWhat do problem gamblers and conspiracy theorists have in common? Both groups believe they can spot patterns in the chaos.For gamblers that can mean believing that because the roulette wheel landed on an even number the last three times, it is sure to do so this time. For those who subscribe to conspiracy theories, it’s believing that autism diagnoses started to increase roughly around the time the MMR vaccine was introduced and therefore one must cause the other.There is even a word for it, apophenia defined as the tendency to perceive connections between unrelated things.The conspiracy theory currently in circulation that the coronavirus is caused or spread by 5G technology is a classic example. The basic theory goes that because telecom companies began installing 5G technology last year and because that is when coronavirus first appeared in China, 5G causes coronavirus. A variation states Government is over-hyping coronavirus so they can keep everyone inside while 5G masts are installed.The theories do not stand up to even the slightest scrutiny and have been refuted by many international bodies including the World Health Organisation (WHO). The fact that many countries without 5G technology have been deeply affected by coronavirus is usually ignored by proponents of the theory.This hasn’t stopped the conspiracy theory spreading like wildfire on social media in the UK and now in Ireland.Now it is starting to have real world consequences. Two mobile phone masts were set on fire, apparently deliberately, in Donegal on Sunday night. The masts were actually 4G infrastructure which were being upgraded to provide extra coverage to Letterkenny General Hospital and the surrounding areas.The arsonists were seemingly following in the footsteps of their co-conspiracy theorists in the UK where there have been dozens of incidents of vandalism, arson and harassment of telecoms workers. Incidents have been reported in the Netherlands and elsewhere.‘Corona charade’Mentions of a link between coronavirus and 5G have increased dramatically on Irish social media in recent weeks, according to Dr Eileen Culloty of Dublin City University(DCU).Dr Culloty, who studies disinformation with a team at the DCU Future of Journalism Institute, said there were very few mentions of the conspiracy theory online before mid-March. This changed when a prominent Irish far-right conspiracy theorist started posting videos on what they called the “Corona charade” or the “scamdemic”. In one video they stated ventilators should not be used for Covid-19 patients “because it’s probably wi-fi poisoning”.The Communications Regulator says it has started receiving queries about the supposed link between 5G and the virus and has urged people to only rely on information about 5G from reputable sources.Some of versions of the theory are so bizarre it is hard to tell if they are jokes. For example, one message spreading around WhatsApp states the public applause for healthcare workers was scheduled to drown out the buzz of 5G networks being tested.“Some people are making fun of the conspiracy theories,” says Dr Culloty. “It’s hard to tell who genuinely believes it and who is just sharing it because they think it’s hilarious.”Public traumasIn many ways, the spread of misinformation around coronavirus should not come as a surprise. From the JFK assassination and 911, major public traumas and conspiracy theories have always gone hand in hand.“Whenever there is a huge event people people want a big dramatic explanation for it. It’s not enough that Princess Diana died in a car accident. There has to be some explanation that matches the upheaval or trauma that people feel,” says Culloty.In both the UK and Ireland celebrities play major a role in spreading misinformation. Musician Jim Corr regularly posts bizarre theories about coronavirus and 5G while singer Damian Dempsey said last month the technology will “fry our brains” and “make us like zombies”.In the UK, television star Amanda Holden received criticism for tweeting a link to a petition linking 5G and coronavirus (she later said it was an accident). The co-host of ITV’s This Morning programme Eamonn Holmes has suggested that it may “suit the state narrative” to dismiss false claims linking 5G telecoms and coronavirus.“The 5G conspiracy has been around for years, mostly within conspiracy networks. But now it’s just hitting mainstream,” says Culloty.In Ireland many of the conspiracy theories are promulgated by the far-right but Dr Culloty says this is not universal. People susceptible to believing in these theories come from all sides of the political spectrum and all sectors of society, including intelligent or highly educated people.While some people spread conspiracy theories to become famous or make money, others earnestly believe they are performing a public service by claiming vaccines cause autism or 5G causes coronavirus, says Culloty.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228073.1586815981!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and martin expected to sign off on framework document for coalition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil and Fine Gael have 72 Dáil seats, eight short of a majority Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin are expected to sign off on a framework document on Tuesday on how a coalition government between their two parties would work.The document is expected to include commitments that there will be no increases in income tax over the lifetime of the next government, speeding up the implementation of the Sláintecare plan, trialling a State childcare scheme and ramping up the delivery of social and affordable housing, among other issues. It is understood that both Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar will discuss on Tuesday how to approach other parties and groups with the document. Between them the two parties have 72 Dáil seats, eight short of a majority, and both have said they want a third, smaller party and some Independents in a coalition government. The framework document is said to be light on specific policy measures but it is rather intended to be “designed to be inviting” for other parties such as the Social Democrats, the Greens and Labour. Thus far the Social Democrats have said their policies would be incompatible with a Fine Gael-Flanna Fáil government. Labour has said it wants to go into opposition, and the Greens are calling for a national unity government. Social contractThe framework document is built around a number of “missions”, and seeks to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, rebuild the economy in its wake and tackle issues that featured in the general election such as health and housing. It will also seek to build a new “social contract”.Other measures included in the document to appeal to those parties include the prospect of a national living wage, although an exact level is not defined. It also mentions reducing the State’s carbon emissions, but a precise target is not mentioned. Other measures in the document are said to include a commitment to build upon the extra resources allocated to the health sector during the Covid-19 crisis. Well-placed sources said the document envisages using economic growth to tackle a deficit caused by extra spending to deal with Covid-19 rather than austerity measures seen during the financial crash. Continuing support of the European Central Bank was cited by sources in helping Ireland through the post-crisis period, although it is not clear if this is included in the documentAmong the proposals said to be included are grants for businesses hit by the pandemic. Housing policy is understood to have seen a significant change in emphasis, compared to the previous Fine GaelIndependent minority government approach.Affordable housingThe Land Development Agency will be give a greater role to deliver social and affordable housing, as well as affordable rental houses. The pledge not to increase income taxes was said to be key for Fine Gael, but does not rule out other tax changes, such as the removal of some tax incentives.Minister for Health Simon Harris on Monday said a majority government was needed to deal with the “massive challenges” ahead. “We need other political parties to join us.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228064.1586810885!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emmanuel macron extends france s lockdown until may 11th","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron addresses the nation about coronavirus on Monday night.  Photograph: Charles PlatiauReutersFrance will not begin to lift its lockdown against the Covid-19 pandemic until May 11th, President Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday night.“The epidemic is not yet under control,” Mr Macron said. “We will have to live with the virus for several more months.”France has reported 132,591 cases of Covid-19. About 14,400 French people have died from the disease.Crèches, primary and secondary schools will begin reopening on May 11th, Mr Macron said. University courses will not resume before summer. No summer festivals may be held before mid-July, at the earliest. All places of public gathering will remain closed until further notice.French borders will remain closed for the indefinite future.The French president said that from May 11th, all people who show symptoms of Covid-19 will be tested. The announcement fell short of a general testing programme which some experts say is necessary to identify carriers of the virus who show no symptoms.From May 11th, members of the public should be able to obtain surgical masks, which may become mandatory is some places, such as public transport.Mr Macron continued to compare the epidemic to a war, as he has in earlier speeches. He again thanked medical personnel “in the front line”. The beginning of his speech was postponed for several minutes while French people applauded healthcare workers from their windows, as they do every evening.Mr Macron praised the people who are enabling France to live under lockdown, including farmers, lorry drivers, deliverymen, cashiers and rubbish collectors. “Our country is holding together thanks to men and women who receive too little pay or recognition,” he said.CriticismMr Macron addressed the severe criticism that has been levelled at his administration. “Were we prepared enough for this crisis?” he asked. “Obviously not. But we faced up to it. In France, as everywhere else, we had to act urgently, take difficult decisions based on incomplete and often changing information, adapt constantly. This virus was unknown and still today holds many mysteries.”Like other countries, Mr Macron continued, France lacked surgical smocks, latex gloves and disinfectant gel. “We were not able to distribute as many masks as we wanted to healthcare workers,” he admitted. “I fully understand that when you’re on the frontline it is hard to understand that a worldwide shortage is preventing deliveries.”Within three weeks, France will quintuple its production of surgical masks, and manufacture 10,000 ventilators, Mr Macron promised. Failings will be addressed “in due course”, he added.The French president also wanted successes to be recognised, including doubling the number of beds in intensive care units, “unprecedented co-operation” between public and private hospitals and the transfer of patients to less affected regions and neighbouring countries.“But nothing is definitively won,” Mr Macron admitted. In eastern France and the Paris region, “hospital services are saturated. The epidemic is not under control. We must continue our efforts and apply the rules. The more they are respected, the more lives we will save.”Prolonging the lockdown until May 11th was “essential to slow the propagation of the virus even more, to have enough ICU beds and to enable healthcare workers to regain their strength”.Even then, Mr Macron warned “May 11th will only be possible if we continue to show civic sense and responsibility”.Mr Macron said he would ask hospitals and nursing homes to make it possible for those who are dying to see loved ones a last time.Government fundsMore than eight million French workers are receiving government funds under measures put in place to ease effects of the epidemic. Mr Macron said he will ask this week’s cabinet meeting to increase assistance further.Some Asian countries lifted lockdowns to find that “the virus which they thought they had conquered returned, and they had to shut down their economies again”, Mr Macron said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228041.1586811333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bernie sanders endorses joe biden s presidential campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden with his former  competitor Bernie Sanders before the start of a debate in Washington, DC. Photograph: Mandel NganAFP via Getty ImagesBernie Sanders has endorsed Joe Biden’s bid for the US presidency, giving the presumptive Democratic nominee an enthusiastic backing that could help unite the party after a isive primary season.Mr Sanders (78), the senator from Vermont, announced his endorsement on Monday in a live streamed statement with Mr Biden (77), who is now the Democratic party’s presumptive presidential nominee to take on Donald Trump in November. “Today I am asking all Americans, I am asking every Democrat, I am asking every independent, I am asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse, to make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe . . . is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country,” Mr Sanders told Mr Biden. “We have got to make Trump a one-term president and we need you in the White House,” the senator added. “I will do all I can to see that that happens.”Mr Sanders, an independent and self-described Democratic socialist, ended his own presidential campaign last week, saying he had no “feasible path” to the Democratic nomination. He initially stopped short of endorsing Mr Biden, saying he would stay on the ballot in remaining primary states to amass “as many delegates as possible at the Democratic convention” to “exert significant influence over the party platform”.Medicare for AllMr Sanders ran a progressive primary campaign centred on “Medicare for All”, which would have effectively eliminated private health insurance in the US. His loyal base of supporters, many of whom are younger, spent much of the primary season at odds with more centrist Democratic candidates, including Mr Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.In 2016, Mr Sanders waited until July, just before the Democratic National Convention, to formally endorse Hillary Clinton for the presidency, a move that many Clinton backers said hurt the former secretary of state in her campaign against Mr Trump.Around a quarter of Mr Sanders’s 2016 primary supporters did not vote for Mrs Clinton in the general election – instead either voting for Mr Trump or a third-party candidate, or not voting at all, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a YouGov survey of 50,000 US voters.More recent polling from Morning Consult suggested at least four in five of Mr Sanders’s 2020 primary supporters would back Mr Biden in November. The Morning Consult poll, conducted after Mr Sanders suspended his campaign last week, found 80 per cent of the Vermont senator’s supporters would vote for the former vice-president in a head-to-head match up against Mr Trump, compared to 7 per cent who said they would back the incumbent.Brad Parscale, campaign manager for Mr Trump’s re-election bid, on Monday dismissed Mr Sanders’s endorsement.“Almost no one is excited about a Biden candidacy. And while Biden is the Democrat establishment’s candidate, President Trump remains the disrupter candidate who has brought change to Washington,” Mr Parscale said. “President Trump’s supporters will run through a brick wall to vote for him. Nobody is running through a brick wall for Joe Biden. ”Mr Biden has received endorsements from most Democrats on Capitol Hill, as well as hundreds of Democratic state and local officials. High-profile endorsements from former Democratic presidential candidates including Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, Mr Buttigieg and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke helped propel the former vice-president to sweeping victories on Super Tuesday last month, after a nearly 40-point victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178How many coronavirus cases are in your area?

Knowing my own hyper-social tendencies when the weather becomes clement and the fact that my book Welcome To The Woke Trials should be completed by autumn, I should have seen incarceration as a scary blessing which would guarantee delivery. But I actually wondered for a couple of weeks whether I should write it at all – #allinthistogether and all that jazz.Luckily, the copious whining and ill-will from Wokers at a time when the Conservative government is acting like Robin Hood has given me renewed purpose.When most people are in denial, they’re in denial about Bad Things – as a coping mechanism – but the Woke are the only group who are permanently in denial about Good Things, such as the generosity of the government, for kicks. It must drive them nuts that we’re finally moving towards a sort of socialism – not a performative brag – in which ordinary people become everyday heroes. The Woke in this crisis remind me of those dogs you see in pubs sometimes, who aren’t really angry, but utter one bark every ten minutes just to keep their equipment running.The preferred leisure activity of the Woke is, of course, virtue-signalling – and don’t they have a brand new box of toys to chuck out of their prams now! Putting on a mask and gloves just to go out for a pint of almond milk they get to feel like bold frontline fighters, looking askance at those of us with the temerity to expose our noses and knuckles.Hearing of hoi polloi relaxing in public spaces they can tut smugly as they tend their herb gardens. On social media they can advocate for avocados as a sure way to wellness with the implication that if one is sensible enough to eat clean nothing so common as the coronavirus would dare invade one’s immaculate innards.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedThe plague has highlighted the gap between many groups – those who do useful work are more likely to get it than the useless, ethnic minorities are more likely than white people, men than women, smokers than non-smokers. But I’d imagine that it will be spread equally between Modernists (my tribe) and Nostalgics – Hopers vs Mopers, as I think of them. We Hopers can’t wait to rush out and thrown our arms around our one and only world in all its corrupt glory once more the Mopers having got what they wanted – no cheap foreign travel, Mother Nature silencing the city – and are keen to stress that when we get out the other side we must not re-prioritise frivolous things over the simple life.That’s what they say, of course – what they do is entirely different. I wouldn’t despise virtue-signalling so much if it was just a prelude to actual virtue, but I’ve come to believe from extended observation that many practitioners simply use it as a smokescreen that enables them to be even more selfish than the rest of us. The “Woke Cloak” as it’s been called, which led to the amusing spectacle last year of the Extinction Rebellion spokesman who flounced out of an interview after it was pointed out to him that the many skiing trips he had posted on social media were hardly the “emergencies” that he wanted flying to be confined to.So in this time of contemplation, I’d like to speak up for foreign travel, incessant socialising and crazed pleasure-seeking. But for all you Nostalgics who’ve suddenly had the revelation that you wanted to live like an Amish all along, please do stick to your plan of staycations and home-cooking because, to be honest, you don’t bring a great deal in the way of wit and wisdom to the table and I think we’ll just about struggle along without you.And everyone who’s ever spoken or typed the words Big Pharma will hopefully go to the back of the queue when a vaccine is discovered (probably by the Israelis – none for you, boycotters!), stick to their crystals and leave the nasty newfangled vaccines to we shameless embracers of the modern world. And please, have the sensitivity to understand that for the millions of your fellow citizens whose lives were pretty damn simple already – eat, work, sleep, worry about money, repeat – what lies ahead is not a pastoral Walden Pond dream, but a living nightmare.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Mr Macron said the tense situation in hospitals in Paris and eastern France meant there could be no let-up in the country.Since March 17, France\u0027s 67 million people have been ordered to stay at home except to buy food, go to work, seek medical care or exercise on their own. The lockdown was originally scheduled to end on Tuesday.I fully understand the effort I\u0027m asking from you, Mr Macron told the nation in a televised address at the end of the lockdown\u0027s fourth week, adding that the current rules were working.When will we be able to return to a normal life? I would love to be able to answer you. But to be frank, I have to humbly tell you we don\u0027t have definitive answers, he said.Schools and shops would progressively reopen on May 11, Mr Macron said. But restaurants, hotels, cafes and cinemas would have to remain shut longer, he added. International arrivals from non-European countries will remain prohibited until further notice.Mr Macron, whose government has faced criticism over a shortage of face masks and testing kits, said that by May 11, France would be able to test anyone presenting Covid-19 symptoms and give non-professional face masks to the public.Mr Macron also said he had asked his government to present this week new financial aid for families and students in need.Acknowledging his country had not been sufficiently prepared early on to face the challenges posed by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Mr Macron appeared to seek a humble tone in contrast to the war-like rhetoric of his previous speeches.Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped, he said. This moment, let\u0027s be honest, has revealed cracks, shortages. Like every country in the world, we have lacked gloves, hand gel, we haven\u0027t been able to give out as many masks as we wanted to our health professionals.The French, long accustomed to being told their high taxes paid for the best healthcare in the world, have been dismayed by the rationing of critical drugs, face masks and equipment and have watched with envy the situation in neighbouring Germany.Mr Macron\u0027s acknowledgment of the shortcomings was broadly well-received.It\u0027s not every day you hear a president offer a mea culpa and dare to say \u0027we have no definitive answers\u0027. Reassuring and necessary sincerity, analyst Maxime Sbaihi of the think tank GenerationLibre said.After a relentless increase until the first week of April, the number of patients in French hospitals\u0027 intensive care units has started to decline, prompting health authorities to call a plateau in the epidemic.But if French hospitals are just about coping, helped by a massive effort to transfer patients by plane, helicopter or even high-speed train from hospitals in the east and Paris to the west, nursing homes have been overwhelmed.By Monday, the coronavirus had claimed 14,967 lives in France, the fourth-highest death toll in the world, with more than 98,076 confirmed cases, according to official figures.We\u0027ll have better days, and we\u0027ll return to happy days, Mr Macron said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government thought imposing lockdown would difficult convincing","story":"Having found the right message to convince the public of the need to stay indoors, the Government is now in danger of becoming a victim of its own success, in public information terms at least. The coronavirus lockdown will, one day, come to an end, but on the current evidence, persuading people that it is safe to go back to their normal lives will be a challenge.A YouGov poll published on Monday showed huge support for the stringent social distancing measures imposed by Boris Johnson, with little appetite for an immediate lifting of curbs that had seemed inconceivable only a few weeks ago.Ministers have been taken aback by just how obedient the public has been. Businesses that could have remained open throughout the crisis - like Greggs and McDonald\u0027s - were forced to shut down under pressure from customers, and estimates of 20 per cent of children attending school proved to be way out. The actual figure has been below two per cent.The knock-on effect of all this has been devastating for the economy, with Government loans and bailouts costing billions more each week than predicted. Unemployment has soared.With deaths falling for a third day in a row on Monday - albeit over a bank holiday weekend which could have affected reporting - thoughts in Whitehall are now turning to how and when to get the country moving again.Whether we are a week, a month, or even further away from that moment, there will come a point when Britain will be told to start going back to work, school, and even the pub.The problem for the Government is that simply telling the public what they should do will not be enough. They must first be convinced that what they are being told is the right thing to do, and that the Government is not simply putting the economy before saving lives.Ministers have been asked to come up with evidence to show how many lives could ultimately be lost, rather than saved, by the lockdown, through missed cancer diagnoses, long-term poverty and an underfunded NHS.“There’s no point announcing something before the public is ready for it,” one minister said on Monday. “If you look at what happened when we went into lockdown, we took the public with us because they realised the time had come when it needed to be done. If we had done it a week earlier people would have ignored it and a week later people would have said we reacted too late. It has to be the same when we come out of this.”Hence a lot of thought is now going into just how the lifting of the lockdown is eventually presented.Talk of an “exit strategy” has been dropped, because the word “exit” implies an abrupt end to the lockdown which the public finds worrying. Instead we can expect to hear more and more talk of “emerging” from the lockdown and “unwinding” the measures as part of a more gradual process.As long as the NHS retains the capacity to deal with all coronavirus patients, as it has done so far (in contrast to Italy, where hospitals were overrun), and as long as deaths continue to fall, ministers will be able to make the argument for a return to work.As one Government source put it, “only then will we know how many people have been social distancing because they have been told to, and how many are doing it because they are scared”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"half people unable work home coronavirus lockdown figures suggest","story":"Up to half of people are unable to work from home during coronavirus lockdown, figures suggest amid fears for the economic impact of social distancing measures.Those in high income jobs and living in London and the south east are most likely to have been able to adapt, analysis shows as the number of businesses needing Government support to pay staff is much higher than expected.Many parents working from home are now also struggling to juggle childcare with researchers warning that the “economic harms of school closures are high”.It comes amid a Cabinet split on the lockdown, with 10 members reportedly urging conditions to be eased because of concerns about the impact on the economy.Rates of compliance with social distancing measures have been higher than the scientific modelling predicted.The Government says that people should continue to go to work only where they cannot work from home, but there have been some reports of employers asking staff to continue attending the office.Data from the British Chambers of Commerce’s (BCC) weekly tracker poll, seen by the , shows that “54 percent of businesses are using remote working to maintain business continuity”.At the same time an increasing number of companies are opting to furlough their employees, with 37 percent telling the BCC they plan to furlough between 75 to 100 percent of their workforce over the coming week.The Treasury originally suggested that only 10 percent of employers would take up the coronavirus job retention scheme at a cost of around £10 billion.Dr Adam Marshall, BCC Director General, said: “We’ve seen a big jump in the number of firms furloughing staff, and many are now starting to apply for access to government loan and grant schemes to keep themselves afloat. Our research suggests that support is only starting to reach firms on the ground.”Business groups including the CBI are said to have written to the Treasury this weekend asking them to extend the scheme past three months to prevent firms having to lay off staff.It comes as companies struggle to adapt to new ways of working, with a number of smaller firms warning that they do not have the technical capabilities to allow their entire workforce to log in remotely.Figures released by the Office for National Statistics after the lockdown was announced showed that before the pandemic struck there were 32.6million in employment and around 1.7million of those regularly worked from home.Less than 30 percent of the workforce had ever worked from home, according to the annual population survey, with those in higher paid jobs living in London and the south east most able to avoid the office.A survey by YouGov found that 52 percent of people across the UK do not usually work from home and this has not changed despite lockdown measures instructing them to do so. This was lower in the capital, at 37 percent, and highest in Scotland at 59 percent followed by the Midlands and Wales at 56 percent.A daily tracker launched by the polling company, which is providing data to the Government’s scientific team, shows that around 40 percent of people have never worked from home and this has not changed during lockdown.Around a quarter of respondents said that they had changed their workplace and were now working solely from home.The findings have been echoed in a study by the Resolution Foundation, which found that the lowest paid jobs in sectors such as health, retail and tourism – which account for 42 per cent of the workforce -  were “extremely unlikely to be able to work from home”.The authors said: “Less than one-in-ten of those in the bottom half of earners say they can work from home, making it much harder for them to protect their incomes in the face of social distancing measures.”A UCL study, published in the Lancet, has also warned that school closures cause “economic harms to working parents, health-care workers, and other key workers being forced from work to childcare, and to society due to loss of parental productivity”.Research has found that around 16 percent of the workforce are the primary caregivers, rising to 30 percent in health and social care sectors.A three month school closure could wipe up to 1 percent of the UK’s national gross domestic product (GDP) per year, mainly through absenteeism of parents, the authors warned.A growing number of bosses are now concerned about their workers juggling home working and childcare, according to a survey of HR professionals.According to research by People Management magazine and The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 65 percent of employers were worried about their staff’s ability to juggle the two commitments.Just over half said that they were encouraging parents to make up their hours at different times to normal in order to be able to cope.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain planned pandemic didnt address chronically low ppe stocks","story":"In hospitals across the country, doctors and nurses are facing an agonising dilemma. Do they continue to treat coronavirus patients without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), risking their own lives and potentially spreading the virus further, or do they refuse?In some hospitals, doctors are reporting that up to 50 per cent of consultants and nurses have tested positive for coronavirus, with some staff threatening to resign if they continue to be placed in danger.The chief executive of NHS Providers, which distributes equipment, has warned that some trusts are facing critically low levels of gowns and voiced concerns that PPE may run out entirely at some point. At least 19 NHS staff have caught coronavirus and died since the outbreak began, and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has even advised members that they can refuse to treat patients if they are not given the correct equipment. But how did it come to this? Why have doctors and nurses been left on the battlefield without armour?The answer lies in how the Government planned for the pandemic. After the Civil Contingencies Act was passed in 2004, the first UK influenza pandemic contingency plan was published in October 2005, setting out how Britain would handle a mass infection event. Although it suggested stockpiling antivirals, it made no mention of PPE. The follow up-document, a national framework for responding to an influenza pandemic, was published in 2007 and, for the first time, included guidance that PPE should be provided for health workers. But, crucially, it set out that emergency stockpiles would only be triggered in the event of the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring a pandemic, and that rule has remained in place ever since. The Government keeps mass stocks of PPE at depots around the country, but Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, did not declare a pandemic until March 11, meaning hospitals could not touch the supplies until then.Government reports also warned that it would take seven to 10 days for the UK-wide distribution of centrally held stocks and said organisations should prepare to rely initially on local supplies.When the coronavirus epidemic began, some hospitals had virtually no PPE supplies – so by the time the first emergency stockpiled equipment began arriving, many had run out entirely at exactly the time case numbers were soaring.Yet there was little excuse for being so ill-prepared. In 2009, the Government was given a chance to test its pandemic strategy with the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu. The crisis turned out to be relatively mild in Britain, killing 457 people over an eight-month period and leaving health experts believing that they could handle a pandemic with their existing strategy. However, in a review of the response, Dame Deirdre Hind, the chair of the Commission for Health Improvement and former Chief Medical Officer for Wales, warned that the UK could one day face a far more severe outbreak.The danger of another, more severe, pandemic has not gone away,” she concluded. The governments of the UK must avoid complacency and use this opportunity to learn lessons and make improvements for a future in which resources will be tight.By the time the UK influenza pandemic preparedness strategy was published in 2011, the Government had stockpiles of face masks and respirators for health and social care workers in place. However, at this point it was agreed that there would be no stockpiling of PPE outside the NHS – a situation that has remained until today and is now causing major problems.The pandemic stockpile was only designed to supply 226 NHS trusts, not the 58,000 other health and social care providers that desperately need equipment in order to keep people safe. To make matters worse, Public Health England (PHE) has since confirmed that gowns were never included in the national pandemic stockpile of PPE equipment, but said they would be in future. The potentially catastrophic under-preparedness was also laid bare in a three-day dry run for a pandemic, carried out in October 2016 and codenamed Exercise Cygnus, to test how NHS hospitals would cope. It showed that the health service would be quickly overwhelmed by a severe outbreak amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and PPE.Insiders have told The  that although projected shortages of PPE were known, they were not addressed with bulk purchase because of cash constraints and worries that equipment would become outdated or obsolete if left in storage. Instead, work was done on securing reliable supply chains. Yet those supply chains are now breaking down because of the global nature of the pandemic, something that should arguably have been anticipated. In recent years, most respiratory viral epidemics, such as Mers and Sars, have begun in East Asia, yet the Government has continued to rely on China for its equipment. In the updated 2017 NHS England pandemic preparedness report, a number of stockpiles were established and are held in locations across the country for deployment when needed. Yet while many of the stockpiled items were kept in warehouses – described as the just in case supply – others were held on just in time contracts, meaning they would be ordered when needed. It appears nobody foresaw the problem of such an approach during a global pandemic, when the world would be competing for the same supplies. Companies producing PPE have seen orders swell 5,000-fold, which has not only caused supply problems but also safety issues, with gowns and masks failing tests because they are being rushed out at such speed. In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, many countries have also started restricting exports to keep vital supplies at home, while some manufacturers are hiking prices up to unjustifiable levels.The NHS says only China can provide the high volume of fluid-repellent gowns required and is sending a plane a day to pick up stocks. But it is finding that boxes are being pulled from aircraft at the last minute or have been mislabelled and are found to contain the wrong equipment.  Stocks ordered weeks ago have still not arrived and Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said supplies of gowns were running critically low at some trusts. The delay in the WHO declaring a pandemic also prevented the UK from ordering new supplies of PPE to replace its dwindling stocks. Supply problems mean insiders now fear the pandemic reserve stock will run out entirely before new supplies arrive. The supply problem is so grave that PHE has been forced to approve the use of coveralls in place of gowns and extend expiry dates on equipment.Last Friday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, launched a new plan to tackle the dangerously low supplies of PPE, with private companies asked to sign up help out.Current NHS stocks are propped up by donations of 1.2 million goggles, visors and masks from firms such as B\u0026ampQ. Frontline staff have been asked to reuse visors, and the NHS has turned to 3D printing companies to boost supplies, while a 24-hour hotline has been set up for trusts to order PPE whenever they need it. A lack of delivery staff amid the pandemic is also causing hold-ups, even when supplies are available. The Unite union says stockpile warehouses run by Unipart – which is contracted on behalf of NHS supply company Supply Chain Coordination Limited (SCCL) to provide general health service equipment – are struggling to keep up with demand and staff are exhausted.The Army has since been brought in to help move supplies around the country, and earlier this month the Government ordered an urgent national audit of PPE, body bags, swabs and infection control products.NHS England\u0027s chief operating officer, Amanda Pritchard, has admitted there have been some local distribution problems and NHS Providers has also accepted it needs to establish a more sustainable supply chain and says trusts are operating in a hand to mouth situation. The Government is even considering using drones to deliver equipment, test kits and ventilator parts. Mr Hopson has said it would be vital to learn lessons from the PPE crisis, but said it was important to focus on today\u0027s reality.Tragically, for too many NHS staff that reality is a daily dice with death. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/13/12/bocelli.jpg","title":"andrea bocelli easter coronavirus milan concert duomo cathedral kim kardashian","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Kim Kardashian, Hugh Jackman and Kaley Cuoco are among the stars who have praised opera singer Andrea Bocelli’s moving Easter Sunday concert.The Italian tenor performed a show at\u0026nbspthe deserted Duomo cathedral in Milan on Sunday night (12 April).

There’s a formidable amount of black stuff in storage in ships and containers around the planet to get through.And then there’s the demand element of the equation to consider.The unprecedented lockdowns ordered by governments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has seen global demand for energy plummet by around 30 per cent.Opec itself expected global oil demand to fall by 20 million barrels a day in April.That puts the 10 million barrels a day production cuts in the right context.As Bjornar Tonhaugen of Rystad\u0026nbspEnergy\u0026nbspputs it,\u0026nbspOpec has “only come up with half of the ransom money”.You can’t buck the market, as someone once said.Energy analysts are also doubtful about whether the production cuts will actually be delivered.Opec is not the cohesive force that it once was. The cartel has suffered from indiscipline internally. Can countries such as Iraq and Nigeria be relied on not to break ranks as their exchequers come under massive pressure in the coming months? And Opec allies are not necessarily reliable either, as the fiasco with Russia clearly demonstrates.“Trust, but verify” was the cautious view of the US towards Soviet nuclear disarmament pledges during the Cold War. Markets seem to be taking a similar attitude to production cuts now.And yet it’s possible to see something new emerging from the chaos of this price war, in particular the pressure successfully applied by Donald Trump to his Saudi allies and also Vladimir Putin’s Russia.The endorsement of the planned Opec cuts by G20 energy ministers last week and also the International Energy Agency, which was founded by industrialised countries in the 1970s to protect their fuel supplies, could also be significant.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe word is that large oil consumer nations including the US, India, China and Japan are preparing to boost their oil reserves in order to help support the global oil price – and non-Opec western states Norway and Canada have signalled a willingness to cut their own oil production volumes.Economists had expected the collapse in oil prices to exert deflationary pressure on the world economy. A deal to curb supply reduces some of that danger.These are early days, of course. But international coordination on oil production could be a significant legacy of this crisis. It’s far too early to talk about global recovery when we are still on the terrifying downward slope, but more a more stable energy market could help underpin it when it eventually arrives.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This staggering number does not include the number of infants that may not be vaccinated because of the effect of Covid-19 on routine immunisation services.\u0026nbspChildren younger than 12 months of age are more likely to die from measles complications, and if the circulation of measles virus is not stopped, their risk of exposure to measles will increase daily.”The 24 countries that have postponed measles vaccination campaigns are: Bangladesh, Brazil, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, DRC, Ethiopia, Honduras, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Males, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Paraguay, Somalia, South Sudan , Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.Some countries like Brazil, Bangladesh, DRC, South Sudan, Nigeria, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are fighting large measles outbreaks. For example, in DRC the virus has killed more than 6,000 people.The WHO has published new advice for countries to help try and sustain vaccination schemes during the coronavirus pandemic, suggesting that\u0026nbspcountries with no active outbreaks should temporarily pause preventative vaccination schemes.Where schemes are paused, at-risk unvaccinated children should be tracked to make sure they an be protected against measles as soon as possible.It added: “Urgent efforts must be taken now at local, national, regional and global levels to prepare to close the immunity gaps that the measles virus will exploit, by ensuing that vaccines are available, and that they reach children and vulnerable populations, as quickly as possible, to keep them safe.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s all I would say, as someone with an enquiring mind.”Versions of the 5G conspiracy theory have been spreading online for years, with some proponents claiming the coronavirus outbreak is just the latest in a string of pandemics induced by\u0026nbspelectromagnetic waves.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)The theory has been disproved countless times by scientists, with one microbiology professor recently describing it as\u0026nbsp”both a physical and biological impossibility”.That has not stopped the baseless claims being shared by high-profile figures such as actor Woody Harrelson and TV presenter Amanda Holden.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we’re doing everything we can to get that increased volume out where it’s needed.”The meal-kit company HelloFresh provides a regular supply of its surplus fruit and vegetables to the charity – and donated £25,000 to help the charity scale up its operations.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pandemic has hit at cruel time for businesses who rely on themFor the first time in 800 years, the cathedral in Britain’s tiniest city will be empty this Easter Sunday.Several thousand visitors would have been expected to pour into St Davids Cathedral this weekend. Instead, the bishop of St Davids has invited them to pause at 10.30am on Sunday as she presides at the Easter Eucharist – from her kitchen.Because of coronavirus, several dozen of the small businesses in this seaside city in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, will also be losing out on visitors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEaster, and the warmer weather it tends to bring, signals the awakening of the tourist season for hotspots across Britain.St Davids starts to see long lines form at beachside ice cream vans. Surfers hit the breaks on Whitesands Bay, tourists rent kayaks and coasteering guides, and\u0026nbspthen fill up on pasties called oggies before heading back to caravans and campsites.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastInstead, businesses have either sent staff home on furlough, reinvented themselves… or packed up.St Davids Cross Hotel, which has 16 rooms costing up to £145 a night, had been fully booked this weekend and most of next week. More than 100 guests have cancelled.“With the weather we’ve got down in Pembrokeshire at the moment, it’s been absolutely glorious for the last week and it’s going to be very nice next week,” says Alex Perkins, the hotel’s manager. “I suppose now we just hope that we’ll make it up in the summer or the winter.”Initially, the three-star hotel tried to adapt to the pandemic with takeaway food, and even put on a delivery Sunday roast service for Mother’s Day. But as time went on, the owners decided to completely shut and furlough the staff to reduce chances of transmitting the virus. “We’d rather people do stay at home than travel down to us,” Alex adds.Down the road, The Meadow cafe has made a slightly more unusual operational swerve. Co-owner Nick Michell has set up a health and fitness training service, offering one-to-one training through an app\u0026nbspand remote coaching.The 47-year-old says: “I was a personal trainer beforehand and I was intending to incorporate some of my services into what we do at the cafe, with a wellbeing offering.” Now that the cafe has closed, the fitness plans have been jolted into fruition.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would be extremely busy – Easter’s always a very busy time down here anyway because it’s the first of the big holidays after winter.”The farmhouse-style\u0026nbspcafe will benefit from the business rate relief, and the owners will take up the government’s offer to pay 80 per cent of the salary for the 10 furloughed staff. In the summer, another 10 workers are usually hired – a marker of the boom of the local economy in the tourist season. But the virus could wipe\u0026nbspout work for locals. St Davids has a population of around 1,600 but the city’s visitors reach into the hundreds of thousands throughout the year.As for business loans that are being made available by the Welsh government, Nick, who has an 18-month-old daughter, is not keen. “Loans are loans and you’ve got to pay them back,” he says. “With any new business, you invest significantly at the start. So we have already invested quite a lot anyway. We’re reluctant to refinance, to continue reinvesting with the unknown that is the future.”Unknown really is the word – the three-week lockdown marker is about to arrive, with no sign of an end yet in sight. And if we’re slowly eased out of paralysis, cafes, hotels and restaurants fear\u0026nbspmeasures will still restrict customers.The pandemic has hit at a cruel time. “We rely on from now until September to get probably 75 per cent of our income for the year,” Nick adds. His wife Emma, a yoga instructor, may soon be joining him in setting up remote classes.Back at the cathedral, Dean Sarah Rowland Jones still has high spirits. “We’ve got a community WhatsApp group, there’s stuff on Facebook, there’s a lot of people ringing each other up,” she says. “People are being particularly assiduous in looking out for one another. The rest of the year, the resident community is small. So in that sense, it’s quite easy to know who’s who and to watch out for everybody.”The locals who make up the congregation are also still able to join in by watching the cathedral’s YouTube videos, she adds.And at a time of uncertainty, at least they can be fairly sure that next year’s\u0026nbspEaster Sunday service won’t\u0026nbspbe held in the bishop’s\u0026nbspkitchen.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence.Hostility with China is not going to help solve the coronavirus crisisTory rebels are right – Huawei is a threat to our national securityJohnson suffers revolt in Tory vote to end Huawei 5G involvement“Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.”Last month, the government hinted at future concessions to opponents of Huawei’s involvement in rolling out the ultrafast wireless technology when a minister said 36 Tory MPs who refused to vote in line with the leadership had been heard “loud and clear”.The rebels fear Huawei is effectively a front for the Chinese state – putting the UK’s security at risk – and want it ripped out of the 5G network by the end of 2022.But in his letter, Mr Zhang highlighted Huawei’s already extensive role in Britain’s data network, and said the firm was “focused on keeping Britain connected” during the “unprecedented” coronavirus pandemic.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanHe said data usage had increased by at least 50 per cent since Covid-19 first reached the UK, placing “significant pressure” on telecoms systems.“That’s why reliable mobile and broadband networks are crucial. During this pandemic our engineers – designated ‘essential’ workers – are striving around the clock to keep Britain connected.”The intervention comes amid multiple acts of vandalism and arson in recent days against telecoms gear, apparently fuelled by internet conspiracy theories linking the spread of coronavirus to 5G.The baseless theory, which scientists have branded\u0026nbsp“complete rubbish”, suggests radio waves from the technology causes changes in people’s bodies which make\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspsusceptible to the virus.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some 15 per cent of respondents from ethnic minorities said they had lost their job, compared with\u0026nbsp8 per cent of white Britons.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As an absolute priority, ministers must pick up the pace and act to reduce the inequality gap.“Liberal Democrats will be a voice for the most vulnerable at this challenging times. We are calling on the government to introduce a ‘citizen’s income’ and an end to the five-week wait for benefits by raising benefit rates, abolishing sanctions and turning day-one universal credit loans into grants.”The BMG poll exposed the extent of disruption caused by the pandemic.Overall, 31 per cent of those questioned said their household income had fallen.Of those who are facing reduced financial circumstances, a massive 20 per cent – the equivalent of 6 per cent of the population as a whole, or around 4 million people – said their household had lost half or more of its total income.Some 11 per cent of those reporting a loss said their total household income had dropped by up to 9 per cent, 23 per cent said it was down by between 10-19 per cent, 26 per cent that they had lost 20-29 per cent of their income, 7 per cent had lost 30-39 per cent and 5 per cent had lost 40-49 per cent.In a reflection of the empty supermarket shelves left by panic buying, some 50 per cent of those questioned said they had experienced difficulties sourcing food and 49 per cent obtaining other essential items during the outbreak.And family life has suffered, with 23 per cent unable to visit relatives or friends with new babies, 11 per cent missing funerals and 5 per cent cancelling or postponing wedding plans. Half of all those surveyed (50 per cent) said they had cancelled holidays because of coronavirus.BMG questioned 1,541 British adults between 7 and 9 AprilShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When the lockdown was first announced, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers fled cities to walk long distances home to their villages, with dozens dying on the road.Social distancing rules have also proved difficult to follow for those living in urban slums, or informal workers in the food sector, where authorities have had to prioritise feeding the nation over best infection control practices.Mr Modi, who held a four hour conference call with state chief ministers on Saturday, said\u0026nbspthere was a consensus among\u0026nbspstates supporting the extension of\u0026nbspthe lockdown by another two weeks.

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the short term, even if wildlife sellers can’t keep selling these animals in public, they will try to find other ways to keep the businesses alive,” Mr Huang tells The Independent. “As the old saying goes, life will always find a way. Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has badly misjudged the moment, as have the clubs owned by billionaires who have furloughed their tea ladies while pampered footballers continue to earn up to £, a week.It has been embarrassing to see hypocritical footballers mistaking “lockdown” for “lock-in”, acting like the new rules do not apply to them.After previously urging fans to stay at home, Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish emerged bleary-eyed from an all-night party and pranged his -grand Range Rover.Manchester City’s Kyle Walker had a couple of escort girls delivered to his door, soon before telling the peasants to social distance and save lives and blah-blah-blah. All that stuff about washing your hands, Kyle — should that be before or after the escorts have been round And Spurs manager Jose Mourinho oversaw a training session on Hadley Common, for all the world asthere was one rule for the princes of football and one for the plebs who pay their wages.Do the fatheads of football ever watch the news Mass unemployment is coming. Many of the millions about to be chucked on the dole will be football fans. So how the hell can football — the players, clubs, PFA — continue to kid themselves the bubble they exist in has not already burst The world has changed.There should be no more all-night parties, no more escort girls and no more car prangs. Like it or not, footballers are role models and many will follow their lead.Troy Deeney, Watford captain and one of the prime movers behind the Players Together fund, defends Jack Grealish’s busy social le during the time of lockdown. “What’s he going to do ” Troy asked. “Sit in the yard on his own ”Yes, Troy — because that’s what millions are doing right now. Shocking, I know, but the new rules apply to footballers, too.Most footballers come from working-class backgrounds but too many of them have a sense of entitlement worthy of Marie Antoinette.Look what happened to her.NEVER going out is placing an unbearable strain on relationships.So it is nice to see that Camila Morrone, , and Leonardo DiCaprio, , seem to be happily self-isolating together.I was afraid Leo might decide Camila’s just too old for him.STEVE HEDLEY, rail union fat cat at the RMT, boasts that he would “throw a party”Boris Johnson died of coronavirus – and hopes “the whole Cabinet of Tory b******s” also become victims.If Hedley was on a ventilator fighting for his le, would he check how the doctors and nurses caring for him voted at the last election You don’t think those NHS heroes all voted Labour, do you, Steve WILLIAM and Kate carried out their first virtual royal duty this week, thanking teaching staff who look after the children of key workers.I have never seen smiles that wide on the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.I am sure that, deep down inside, they are really missing Harry and Meghan.They are just covering it up really well.FAREWELL Honor Blackman, who has died at the age of , immortal for ever in her career-defining role as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.It is funny how certain names fall out of favour.At school I had mates called Keith and Ian, but nobody is called Keith or Ian today.Same thing with Pussy Galore. Bond girls just don’t get called things like Pussy Galore any more.THIS lockdown is taking an enormous toll on jobs, education and mental health but most of us understand it is necessary.I am infuriated, though, by the constant threats to intensy the lockdown, including closing the parks,a handful of idiots continue to flout the rules.Health Secretary Matt Hancock rages that he finds it “unbelievable that people are not staying at home” – and threatens to ban all exercise.Personally, I find it unbelievable that Hancock makes threats like some little home counties Hitler.Give credit to the MILLIONS who are doing their best during the lockdown.Don’t threaten the decent majority with a punishment beating because a selfish minority break the rules.If this Government ramps up the lockdown they will lose the British people. And something will explode.If some morons can’t stick to the rules, punish THEM – not the rest of us.KILLING EVE lost its way when the show’s creator Phoebe “Fleabag” Waller-Bridge bailed out after the first series. The second series was painfully naff.Early reports on the third series, starting tomorrow on BBC iPlayer, are not promising.But Jodie Comer as Russian assassin Villanelle will always make you want to tune in. Evenit is just for her new outfits.THIS global catastrophe started in China.When the dead are buried and we stand among our ruined economies, there MUST be some kind of reckoning.After World War Two, the Potsdam Conference decided that Germany should pay billion for what Germany had inflicted on humanity.China is now boasting that le is back to normal there, while we are burying NHS nurses like Rebecca Mack, , who worked in a children’s cancer unit. She has been hailed as a “wonderful daughter” by her heartbroken parents.Coronavirus was not an act of God. It started in China.A study by  senior Tories concludes that the UK should pursue China through international courts for £billion in coronavirus compensation.Germany paid for starting the war. Why shouldn’t China pay for coronavirus GREAT news that Boris is out of intensive care and on the way to recovery.But when he emerges from that ICU, he must give himself all the time it takes to fully recover.And then Boris has to lose weight. I saw David Cameron describe Boris as “very fit”.Sorry – a -year-old man who weighs over st is emphatically not “very fit”.He is a serious illness – a heart attack, stroke or diabetes – waiting to happen.I know from having Boris as my neighbour for years that he loves his jogging and cycling. But please slim down, Boris.Carrie and your unborn child need you. So does Dilyn the dog. So does your country.Because Boris Johnson’s great genius is for giving people HOPE.God knows we need some of that right now. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz.

I have had the pneumonia vaccine. Does that give us any protection against Covid- A. I’m afraid it doesn’t. It specically protects against infection with a nasty bacteria called pneumococcus, which can cause a secondary bacterial chest infection in someone who has a viral pneumonia, but the vaccine does not protect against coronavirus itself.Q. My family and I have been in isolation for  days as I had symptoms. My daughter and I are due to go back to work. If my daughter gets symptoms do we all have to isolate again A. Yes you do. If any of you develop the symptoms of a dry persistent coughor raised temperature the process starts again.Once more testing becomes available to people in your position, we will know whether you need to self-isolate for sure or not. Until then it’s better to be on the safe side.Q. Does taking antihistamines help fight the Covid- infection A. Antihistamines have nothing to offer in the fight against Covid-. They have no antiviral action.Q. Where can I buy the antibody test for Covid- A. Please don’t buy an antibody test for the virus. To my knowledge, there is no accurate, reliable, validated test commercially available, and those that are advertised are at ridiculously inflated prices.Any reliable tests which become available should be reserved for frontline doctors and nurses and their families who may be self-isolating so we can discover which of them are immune and are therefore safe to go back to work with patients.Q. I have a chest infection. Am I more likely to get the virus A. Chest infections cause inflammation within the breathing tubes and lung tissue, which can lower resistance to secondary infections.Viral infections are often complicated by bacterial infections and this would be the only reason why antibiotics might be used.So you should stay at home, avoid visitors and practise physical distancing so you are not exposed to the virus while slightly more vulnerable.Q. My we and I have self-isolated for more than two weeks, as have our two daughters and their families. Nobody shows any symptoms, so why can we not now see each other, respecting social distancing A. We are asking everybody during lock-down to stay at home as much as possible, to avoid public transport, to work from homethey can and only to go out for essential supplies and to physically distance themselves from other people when they do.The more people come into contact with others, the more the virus will spread. If one infected person gives the virus to one fewer person than has previously been happening, the infection rate among the population will fall by  per cent.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q. Do people living alone need to wash their hands as often or disinfect their home as often as those who live together A. For people who live alone the risk is much lower. You will only be exposed to the virussomeone brings it to your home, such as a visitor or a delivery.So the need to wash your hands is less but you still need to do ityou are handling post, for example, or even stroking your neighbour’s cat or dog.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she has told us these things over the years and it doesn’t matter what patient she is looking after, this is what she does.”The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCaroline said Jenny has described caring for the PM as surreal.She added: “Our daughter’s very professional so we don’t ask things and she doesn’t spill things. So it wasn’t until Boris was out of intensive care that she actually told us.“She said she’d just had the most surreal time in her le and that she had been taking care of Boris — something she’ll never forget.”Dad Mike added: “Over the years she has always told us that her job is one-on-one nursing with very critically ill people and that means she’s there all the time.“So once we’d heard that Boris Johnson had gone into intensive care it was obvious that at some stage Jenny would possibly run into him.“We knew she’d give him the same level of care she’d have given someone  the week before — or will be giving next week. We’re really proud of her.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Portuguese Luis, who moved to London in , is also believed to have gone straight back to work after Mr Johnson was discharged.One of his friends said yesterday: “He’s an amazing guy. This is really special. You just have to treat each patient that comes in and on this occasion it was the Prime Minister.“I think he’s totally gobsmacked by the reaction and the recognition he’s received. To have the Prime Minister praising you for saving his le is incredible.“He really is Luis the lesaver. He is a great guy.” Both Jenny and Luis were hailed as heroes yesterday back in their home countries.Sir Tim Shadbolt, mayor of Jenny’s home city of Invercargill, said: “It’s not very often a nurse from here saves the le of the British Prime Minister.”New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern also sent Jenny a Facebook message of thanks. And Jenny’s old school, Verdon College, said it had the “sincerest admiration” for her.It added: “Jenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature.“Thanks Jenny for your courage, outstanding work and the example you have provided for everyone at this dficult time. Your old school community is so proud of you!” Luis, born in Aveiro nearPorto, was congratulated by Portugal’s president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa during a phone call on Sunday.Mr Johnson paid tribute to the NHS medics who saved him in an emotional video message recorded on Sunday after he was discharged from hospital and reunited with pregnant fiancée Carrie Symonds.He gave a special mention to “Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal’ — saying they stood at his bedside for  hours when “it could have gone either way”.The PM also name-checked “Po Ling and Shannon and Emily and Angel and Connie and Becky and Rachael and Nicky and Ann”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then build up your hotel with twigs, dry grass, acorns, straw or leaves.Bees, which are in decline across the world, prefer hollow spaces, such as bamboo, to crawl into in winter.Try to place your bug hotel in an area which receives sunlight in the morning and is shaded in the afternoon.Before you know it, spiders, woodlice, ladybirds and all kinds of insects will start arriving.THERE are few joys greater than the sound of birdsong in the morning or the sight of a goldfinch swooping in.And we can all find ways to attract them to our homes, whether it is a large garden or just a window ledge or patio.Many things around the house can be turned into a bird feeder, such as an empty yoghurt pot or the classic half a coconut.Cut holes for string to hang them up.The food can be leftovers, or my children pick out the pips from tomatoes and peppers.Make sure you hang the feeder in a spot which isn’t easily accessed by cats.ONE of the silver linings to the lockdown is that wildle is thriving, with animals venturing into places normally occupied by humans.Hedgehogs have been in steep decline over the past few decades but there are ways to help their numbers rise again.If Mum and Dad use a strimmer around the garden, ask them to be very careful, because these tools can seriously injure these animals as they hide in undergrowth.And our spiny pals in towns and cities have almost been imprisoned because fences between gardens mean they can’t move about.Keeping your two-metre distance, ask your neighbourthey mind you cutting a small, hedgehog-sized shape into the fence.That way you are both creating a hedgehog motorway and bringing neighbours closer together.These wonderful creatures also love a place to hide, so a wood pile is good for them.Just be carefulyou plan to start a bonfire to make sure they are not inside it.One warning, don’t put down milk to feed them. What hedgehogs really like is tinned cat or dog food.A LITTLE water feature will add to the ersity of animals in your garden.It needn’t be a big pond – any container will serve a useful purpose.You could put down a plastic liner or adapt a Tupperware box.Amphibians need a shallow end to access the water, so construct it with dferent depths. One thing is it shouldn’t be so shallow that it dries out in summer. And don’t simply fill it with tap water.You need rain water for it to be desirable to frogs and toads.If you can order plants, there are some which are especially adapted to water, such as the hornwort, which is a great oxygenator.Algae is good food for tadpoles but you need to place the pond partly in the shade.JUST because plant nurseries are closed in the lockdown it doesn’t mean you can’t put flowers in your window box or garden.Many of you will have unused flower seeds in an old drawer or the potting shed and you can still order plants – and herbs, also a good idea – online.Chives, which come back year after year, provide food for both butterflies and bees.Bees are particularly attracted to the colour blue, and geraniums are a good choice, while the herb oregano, an aromatic plant that can be placed on a balcony, will draw in butterflies.If you are growing plants from seed you can plant them in egg boxes with a little soil, and in no time at all you will have created a homemade nursery.It is also helpful to leave a patch of lawn uncut – wildle doesn’t like pristine environments.ANYONE with a garden will be surprised by the amount of nature that already exists there without making any real effort.Before you head out to have a look, get a pen and a paper to note down what you find.Then go out with your children into the nooks and crannies, the deepest undergrowth, and inspect these habitats carefully.It is great to turn over old bricks to look at insects – but while you root around make sure you are not disturbing the homes of larger animals.The kids should note down all the flowers, insects, worms and other creatures they come across.Use your phone to take photos then go online to research what you saw.Find out what trees and plants are in your garden to notice which are good for bees, butterflies or birds.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Guess they’re not the only ones with nine lives.Charlie, who also plans luxury safaris and works closely with anti-poaching charity ForRangers, said he dubbed the antelope ‘Lucky’ in honour of its escape.He said: “We arrived onto the flood plains just as two fully grown lionesses and roughly six very mature cubs had emerged from the cover of a nearby thicket.“Across the flood plain was a large group of a small antelope called red lechwe.“As the young lions trotted off towards their intended targets, splashing and playing as they went, two adult lionesses sat no more than fteen feet from me in the x.“They watched intently as their offspring stalked the herd and tried their luck at making a kill.“All of the young lions failed miserably except for one who managed to separate this young red lechwe from the main herd and close in on it.“Unfortunately for the lion, the young red lechwe’s speed and agility proved too much, and despite having a paw on its haunches the antelope escaped.”Charlie said any hope of the ordeal being over for the antelope was short lived as it tried to hide in the long grass away from the herd.He said: “It was now split from the rest of its herd with a group of lions separating them.“The young lions more or less lost interest at this point and began to stalk one another, pouncing and play fighting with no real interest in continuing to hunt.“The same was not the case for the two adult lionesses next to me.

Water from the floodplain flew into the air as the chase flew past me.“The antelope calf, with the superior speed and agility in the wet conditions escaped, again.

Dominic Raab, who is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson while he recovers from Covid-, will tell Brits that they will have to remain at home for at least another three weeks as ministers grapple with an exit strategy, according to The Times. The lockdown has to be reviewed by law every three weeks, and the first review must be carried out by Thursday this week. The governmentaposs scientic advice group SAGE meets today.But government officials have already made clear there is next to zero chance of restrictions being lted this week. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey warned today: We’re talking about a battle against coronavirus that isn’t gong to be over in weeks - it will take months.” And Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned Britain must first be firmly on the other side of the peak of new cases and deaths. Daily new cases and deaths are beginning to fall - but it is too early to saythe UK has definitely reached a peak yet, orit is staying on a plateau. For live updates about coronavirus, click HERE. Sir Patrick said: When we are firmly the other side of it in terms of numbers coming down, only at that stage might we look at when those measures might be released. A new poll today shows % of the public favour a cautious approach to lting the lockdown. Public opinion is heavily in favour of preventing the virus spreading, evenit causes economic damage - although % want to get people back to work, evenit means there are more Covid- cases.Cabinet ministers are split over exactly when to end the lockdown - and at what point saving the economy comes before protecting every le. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is said to be anxious to push the stay home and save lives message, and is worried that this could be underminednon-essential businesses are allowed to reopen. There are fears a longer closure of schools will damage the ­prospects of poorer children. But government sources have denied Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is pushing for them to reopen. They told the Mirror: “Schools are closed until further notice and that won’t change until the scientic advice changes.”  Asked when the lockdown might be lted, Cabinet minister Ms Coffey told Sky News the “focus right now” is stopping the spread of the virus and a vaccine “may take some considerable time”. She added: We haven’t hit the peak of the infections and so that’s why it’s important to continue the lockdown measures that we have, which do seem to be working. We will be guided by the modelling done by our scientic and clinical advisors. They are meeting partly today but again later in the week and that will give a fresh opportunity for us to consider what needs to be evaluated in terms of deciding at what point we may need to come out of this. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and senior figures from the Welsh and Northern Irish governments have reportedly been invited to a COBRA meeting to discuss a UK-wide approach. Government sources admit that ministers are debating how to balance tackling the coronavirus against the economic effect of the lockdown.  One government source told the Mirror : “We’re clearly concerned about the economic impact of all of this but public health is the absolute priority right now. “It would be wrong to look like bean counters at the expense of saving lives.” "},{"url":null,"title":"education secretary pushing re open","story":"NewsEducation Secretary ‘pushing to re-open schools in May’ over fears for childrenGavin Williamson is said to be concerned about the impact schools closures can have on children - fearing in particular that poor and vulnerable students will be left behindShareCommentsByChiara Fiorillo:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video education-secretary-gavin-williamson-children-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics education-secretary-pushing-re-open-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Gavin Williamson is said to be concerned about the impact schoolsapos closures can have on children - fearing in particular that poor and vulnerable students will be left behindschools remain closed into late May due to the outbreak of Covid-. At the moment, schools are only open for the children of key workers and other pupils are expected to study while staying at home. A source said Mr Williamson is worried about the lack of pupil-teacher interaction during this time as the pandemic continues to effect people globally. It comes after a senior Government source said that the prospect of lockdown restrictions being eased later this week was zero. A Government source told The Sun of Mr Williamson: He’s Education Secretary – he’d, of course, prefer schools to be open. But it’s not his choice. He is worried about all children and how they are going to do. There is no replacement for children going along to classes under the supervision of teachers who know them. However, schools will only be opened when it is safe to do so. There are fears a longer closure of schools will damage the ­prospects of poorer children. But speaking to the Mirror, government sources denied Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is pushing for them to reopen. They told the Mirror: “Schools are closed until further notice and that won’t change until the scientic advice changes.” The Cabinet is said to be split between hawks who want the lockdown to be lted in weeks and doves who believe it should last until Whitsun at the end of May.  Another source added to the Daily Mail: There is no replacement for children going along to classes under the supervision of teachers who know them. However, schools will only be opened when it is safe to do so. The decision to close the nationaposs schools last month was the toughest of his political career, Mr Williamson said last week.

It also claims that party officials opposed to Mr Corbyn worked to lose the  general election in the hope that a bad result would trigger a leadership contest to depose him. In a joint statement, Mr Starmer and his deputy Angela Rayner launched an investigation into the claims made in the document, how the evidence in it was gathered and how it was leaked.  The statement said: “We have seen a copy of an apparently internal report about the work of the Labour Party’s Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism. The content and the release of the report into the public domain raise a number of matters of serious concern. “We will, therefore, commission an urgent independent investigation into this matter. This investigation will be instructed to look at three areas. First, the background and circumstances in which the report was commissioned and the process involved. Second, the contents and wider culture and practices referred to in the report. Third, the circumstances in which the report was put into the public domain. “We have also asked for immediate sight of any legal advice the Labour Party has already received about the report. “In the meantime, we ask everyone concerned to refrain from drawing conclusions before the investigation is complete and we will be asking the General Secretary to put measures in place to protect the welfare of party members and party staff who are concerned or affected by this report.” The report claims to have found no evidence of anti-Semitism complaints being handled dferently to other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being motivated by anti-Semitic intent.

Government sources admit that ministers are debating how to balance tackling the coronavirus against the economic effect of the lockdown. One government source said: “We’re clearly concerned about the economic impact of all of this but public health is the absolute priority right now. “It would be wrong to look like bean counters at the expense of saving lives.” But another Cabinet source stressed that the health of the economy and the public’s health were intricately linked. They claimed to the Mirror: “It’s not a binary choice between protecting lives and protecting the economy, we want to protect both.” The source said modelling and analysis were ongoing so officials know what trade-off decisions need to be made. Other elements including the impact of poverty on the public’s health and delays to healthcare for other conditions will also be part of considerations. But the source added: “I don’t see how you can have a conversation about lting lockdown when you are still seeing an increase in the number of deaths.”  There are fears a longer closure of schools will damage the ­prospects of poorer children. But government sources have denied Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is pushing for them to reopen. They told the Mirror: “Schools are closed until further notice and that won’t change until the scientic advice changes.” The government expects to extend the restrictions at a meeting on Thursday, with experts arguing that the UK is not yet through the worst of the pandemic. Tonight First Secretary of State and PM Boris Johnson ’s stand-in Dominic Raab thanked the UK public for staying at home over the Bank Holiday weekend. He said: “People should be in absolutely no doubt that, by staying home this weekend, you have saved lives, and you also helped protect our precious NHS at this critical moment in the crisis.” The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis. Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. He added: “We have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacriced too much to ease up now.” Asked about plans to loosen lockdown restrictions, Mr Raab replied that it was “too early to talk about that”. After another  coronavirus patients died in UK hospital, the total stands at ,. It is the lowest increase recorded over the Bank Holiday weekend, after  on Friday, which surpassed the worst confirmed daily totals in Italy and Spain of  on Saturday and  on Sunday. But experts warned that the lower number was due to the holiday and not necessarily a sign of a slowdown.  Professor James Naismith of the University of Oxford added: “We will have to see further data before making any firm judgment as to trends.” Chief Scientic Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said: “When we are firmly the other side of it in terms of numbers coming down, only at that stage might we look at when those measures might be released.” The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies will meet today ahead of a decision on Thursday on whether or not to extend the lockdown. Figures show one in seven people who ended up in hospital with coronavirus in the UK have died.

Ministers refused demands from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and other parties to recall Parliament. It will sit from April  as planned, but ministers will be grilled over webcam rather than in person as the battle to stop the spread of the virus continues. The House of Commons Commission will decide how the virtual parliament will work when it meets on Thursday. One option is for Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to sit alone in the Commons chamber with MPs participating via video link. Ministers would also be required to appear remotely for ministerial question time sessions, urgent questions and other business relating to the House Commons. Another idea is for ministers and shadow ministers to appear in person as other MPs “dial-in”. Sir Keir said: “It’s very important in a crisis like this that Parliament is sitting so that decisions can be properly scrutinised.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror let never forget","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Let us never forget the brave NHS heroes who lost lives to coronavirusThe Mirror is launching the “Protect Us” campaign on behalf of all those serving Britain at its time of need, and we demand PPE for all NHS staff, carers, cleaners, porters, transport workers and anyone  at riskShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video patrick-vallance-uk-see-more-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics voice-mirror-let-never-forget-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

When the nation needed their dedication, kindness and expertise, they answered that call and, in doing so, paid the highest of prices. These were not just the very best of the health service. They were loved ones, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. And many of them would be alive todaythey had been provided with the proper kit. For all the wild promises by ministers there is still a woeful shortage of personal protection equipment. Stories from those working in our hospitals, clinics and care homes should shame the Government. Doctors and nurses are putting their lives in danger every day because they do not have enough masks, gowns, gloves and goggles. Faces of the NHS heroes who have died during the coronavirus pandemic Many are having to pay for their own equipment or are having to re-use existing kit. Others have resorted to fashioning make-sht gowns from bin liners. Instead of taking responsibility for this shameful situation, Health Secretary Matt Hancock insinuated that NHS staff were being too profligate in using what he described as “precious” equipment. Essential PPE should not be a luxury that needs rationing. It should be a basic right of anyone working in our health service at this crucial time. This is especially the case when so few frontline workers have been tested so far.  Boris Johnson did not stint in his praise for the NHS workers who saved his le. The National Health Service, the Prime Minister said, is the “best” and the “beating heart of this country.” If Mr Johnson wants to show genuine gratitude these words must be matched by some genuine action. The Prime Minister is rightly recuperating, but the Government must redouble its efforts in his absence.The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis. Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. Our political leaders have compared this moment of national crisis to a time of war. If they want to draw comparisons with previous battles then they should act with the same urgency that was shown in previous campaigns. During the Second World War our assembly lines were reconfigured to provide the necessary munitions.  Our industries should be transformed on a similar scale to provide the masks, gowns, goggles and gloves our key workers need. That is why the Mirror is launching our “Protect Us” campaign on behalf of all those serving the country at its time of need. We are demanding PPE is provided for NHS staff, carers, cleaners, porters, transport workers and anyone  who may be at risk. In the First World War the way the heroes in the trenches were let down by the officer class was compared to lions being led by donkeys.In the campaign against the coronavirus our angels on the medical frontline are being commanded by dullards. You should no more consider requesting our NHS staff and carers to tend for the vulnerable without gowns and masks than you would countenance sending soldiers over the top without rles and helmets. Yet that is what is happening now. The heroes and heroines of the NHS are the pride of the country. It is incomprehensible they still do not have the kit they need. And it will be inexcusablemore were to lose their lives because of the incompetence of our political masters.

Chicago based bioethicist and professor of healthcare management Zeke Emanuel has poured cold water on the idea that large public gatherings would be up and running later this year. Speaking at a New York Times roundtable, Mr Emanuel questioned promoters who were rescheduling cancelled events for dates in . “Larger gatherings – conferences, concerts, sporting events – when people say they’re going to reschedule this conference or graduation event for October , I have no idea how they think that’s a plausible possibility, he said. I think those things will be the last to . “Realistically we’re talking fall  at the earliest.” As it stands all UK festivals over the coming months have been cancelled. Glastonbury Festival organisers decided it could not go ahead with its th anniversary in June and BST Hyde Park dates were cancelled. US Festival Coachella moved its festival from April to October this year. Others are playing for time. Reading and Leeds Festival has yet to cancel its outings at the end of August this year, which will see Stomzy, Liam Gallagher and Rage Against the Machine headlinethe events can run. Mr Emanuel added: Restarting the economy has to be done in stages, and it does have to start with more physical distancing at a worksite that allows people who are at lower risk to come back.  “Certain kinds of construction, or manufacturing or offices, in which you can maintain six-foot distances are more reasonable to start sooner.”Yesterday Dominic Raab said the Government will not even consider lting the UK coronavirus lockdown this week.

The inquest was told how Wendy had been reported missing by her daughter on Sunday, March  after she failed to get any response when she knocked on the door of her Tunstall Road home. Police soon broke in and made the terrible discovery.  North Staffordshire assistant coroner Sarah Murphy said: The circumstances reported to the coroneraposs court are that the deceased lived alone and was having building work done at the house. She was not satisfied with the builder and another contractor was due to start. On March  via social media she last had contact with her family. Her daughter later sent her a message but it was not replied to. Her daughter became concerned and visited her on March . There was no reply to her knocking on the door and she found flowers on the doorstep sent by her brother. She became concerned and contacted the police and reported the deceased as a missing person.  Police arrived and checked the property and while at the back they noticed a curtain hanging from the window of the conservatory. They saw there was furniture covered and on the floor it looked like there was a body covered in plastic sheeting. They found the deceased on the floor in the conservatory. The deceased had a severe blunt trauma head injury. There were signs of a disturbance as there was glass and a bottle smashed on the floor. We donapost have a cause of death. A post-mortem examination has been requested and there is reason to suspect that the death was violent and unnatural and therefore an inquest is necessary.

Among them is British Red Cross volunteer Rukia Shepherd, , who knows all about helping out in a crisis, having already helped victims of the Manchester Arena bombing and Grenfell Tower tragedy in  As more of you sign up to join our Kindness Will Keep Us Together campaign, Rukia tells us how it’s done – and why it’s so worthwhile. She says: “Someone said to me, ‘I bet you’re sick and tired of this’ – but I’m not. I take pride in volunteering. “Things are so awful at the minute but showing people kindness can make a big dference – to us all.” She is part of an emergency response team looking after vulnerable people across the North West, and works for eight hours a day delivering food and supplies to struggling families. As we speak, she is queuing in a supermarket to collect shopping for people who cannot get out. She has spent the day collecting PPE gear and delivering essentials to homeless shelters, sourcing a new walking stick for a disabled mum and arranging for a cot to be delivered to a mum who had nowhere for her newborn to sleep, as well as dropping off food parcels to vulnerable families.  It is late and she is tired, but she sounds upbeat as talks about her “brilliant” day. She says: “Seeing the look on those kids’ faces when I dropped their food off – laughing and all excited – that makes it all worthwhile. You know they’re going to eat well and be OK.” She adds: “There are so many people who can’t get out, who can’t help themselves right now – soI can do it for them, I will.” The primary school teaching assistant lives in Manchester with pharmacy delivery driver husband Howerd, , and their three teenage kids. She was working at a school where several pupils and teachers were caught up in the Arena bombing when the Red Cross appealed for volunteers.  Rukia came forward to help comfort victims’ families at the Royal Oldham Hospital. She says: “Nothing prepares you for a scene like that. There was a deafening silence. As well as the families the staff were in shock.” But even among the horror, volunteering brought her hope. “There was strength, kindness but most of all humanity,” she says. “I’d never experienced that feeling so strongly before.” Weeks later the Grenfell Tower tragedy unfolded. “My gut instinct was to go,” she says. She spent two weeks looking after severely traumatised residents who had lost everything. “I remember one man in particular,” she says. “He had lost his -year-old daughter and was too numb to speak. I struggled to not become emotional.” Rukia is partly motivated by wanting to repay the kindness she was shown as a vulnerable young woman living in poverty and facing homelessness.

A KFC spokesperson had said the closure was to help protect the well-being and safety of our teams and of our guests.With images of Brits flocking to beaches and joining other large gatherings, despite the Government advising strict social distancing measures, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made the decision to lock the country down.It’s not a decision we’ve taken lightly, but it’s in the best interests of both our incredible teams and all the fans that love our chicken, KFC said at the time.  The two Manchester shops have, however, quietly re-opened with a limed menu. A spokesperson said: “Over the last week, we’ve reopened our Deansgate and Hulme restaurants. They’re open for delivery only and are serving a limited menu, operated by fewer team members with new procedures in place to help ensure we’re following social distancing guidelines. There’s still a need for affordable, accessible food at this time - so we want to do our part. We’re also donating hundreds of meals from both restaurants to those on the frontline, including the NHS and key workers, in partnership with Deliveroo.” It is unclear whether other UK branches will also be re-opening.A photo appeared on Twitter yesterday of several Deliveroo drivers waiting outside KFCaposs Deansgate branch."},{"url":null,"title":"leading scientist claims government recklessly","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Scientist claims Government recklessly allowed thousands to catch bugEXCLUSIVE: Prof Helen Ward also warnscoronavirus Covid- restrictions are eased in the UK in a few weeks - like in Spain and Italy - a resurgence of cases is quite likelyShareCommentsByNick Sommerlad:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video former-health-secretary-alan-johnson-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news leading-scientist-claims-government-recklessly-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Prof Helen Ward tweeted: “We said lockdown earlier, we said test, trace, isolate. They decided they knew better. There will be a reckoning, and it will not be forgiving.” Prof Ward, of Imperial College London’s Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, told the Mirror the decision in early March to stop community testing and contact tracing was a “big problem” which meant we “lost sight” of the pandemic. Prof Ward said: “The Government instituted the lockdown on March . Ten days earlier it was clear we needed stringent social distancing – those ten days were lost. The World Health Organisation and other countries were recommending it while the UK was still pursuing ‘we know better’.” Asked why Britain’s epidemic was worse than countries like France and Germany, she said: “There was a lack of testing, lack of PPE, lack of ventilators and the lack of hospital beds and NHS capacity, a result of  years of cuts.” "},{"url":null,"title":"manufacturer shows cars workers driveways","story":"NewsManufacturer shows off cars from workers driveways during coronavirus lockdownSEATs Live Showcase service allows customers to have a look around new vehicles even though retailers have been shut down by the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-ShareCommentsBySWNS News:,  APR NewsSEAT Live Showcase expert, Tony, demonstrating a Tarraco SUV to a potential customer\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The conservationist, who has worked with Harry on a number of projects over the years, said she has been in touch with him since he and we Meghan Markle packed their bags and left the UK. The Sussex family officially quit The Firm at the start of the month, saying they planned to carve out a progressive new role within the Royal Family and become financially independent. Dr Goodall told Radio Times: I donapost know how his career is going to map out, but yes, Iaposve been in touch, though I think heaposs finding le a bit challenging just now. Last year, Harry interviewed Dr Goodall for Meghanaposs Forces of Change Vogue edition. Now they are no longer working royals, Meghan and Harry are free to make their own money and will be on the lookout for new projects. Meghan has already given her voice to a new Disney+ film, Elephant, which received reviews from critics.  However, she reportedly didnapost get paid for her role in the show, and instead arranged for a sizeable donation to be made to an elephant charity. In the interview, Dr Goodall was askedshe thought Harry and his brother Prince William were champions of the natural world, and she said: Yes, except they hunt and shoot. But I think Harry will stop because Meghan doesnapost like hunting, so I suspect that is over for him.  Meghan and Harry are both big fans of Dr Goodall, and invited her to their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage last summer before they moved to Canada. Speaking about her visit in a previous interview, she said Harry told her he didnapost want Archie growing up in the royal spotlight. Speaking to the  Daily Mail’s Weekend Magazine, she said: “At the end [of the conversation] Meghan came in to listen with Archie.  “He was very tiny and very sleepy – not too pleased to be passed from his mummy. I think I was one of the first to cuddle him outside the family. “I made Archie do the Queen’s wave, saying, ‘I suppose he’ll have to learn this’. Harry said: ‘No, he’s not growing up like thatapos. Dr Goodall is currently following self-isolationg and social distancing guidelines due to coronavirus. Speaking about how sheaposs dealing with the Covid- lockdown during her chat with Radio Times, she said sheaposs enjoying being at home but finds replying to emails more tiring than travelling the world.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSome coronavirus sufferers have reported another three mild symptoms in addition to those well documented. It is now more than two months since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK. Since the virus first began edging its way towards the UK public health officials have warned that new, persistent coughs and fevers are tell-tale signs of the disease. Other, milder symptoms have also become hallmarks of the disease in recent weeks. These include physical and mental fatigue, loss of sense of smell and a lack of appetite.As more and more people have been struck down by Covid- and understanding of the disease has grown, an even fuller list of symptoms has emerged. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@trinitymirror   A buzzing sensation One of the more curious ones is a buzzing sensation that runs through the body. While it has not been listed as an official symptom to watch out for, many people have posted online about experiencing a aposfizzingapos sensation. Tarana Burke, recognised as the founder of the #MeToo movement, said that her partner had the illness and the sensation that his aposskin felt like it was burningapos. Twitter user @Miafia described having “an electric feeling on my skin.” Dr Daniel Grfin, chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates in the US, has suggested the feeling may be part of an auto-immune response to a patientsapos nervous system. “Clearly it’s been identied, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” he told the New York Post. Dr Vipul Shah, Clinical Director at telehealth service Pack Health, suggested it may simply be people experiencing a fever for the first time. Needing the toilet Another mild symptom of coronavirus that is being reported with increased regularity is the need to go to the toilet more often. Dr Diana Gall explained to the Express : Digestion problems and changes in bowel habits - particularly looser stools and making more frequent trips to the toilet - are sometimes the first signs that you’re coming down with something, not just with this coronavirus.  However, diarrhoea has been reported as an early symptom in patients who have later tested positive for Covid-. A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, analysed data  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and found nearly  per cent had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Isla Haslam, , from Balham, South West London, experienced stomach problems while suffering with the coronavirus. She realised that what she first thought was the consequences of a lentil heavy dinner was in fact coronavirus when she began to feel feverish. Testicular pain The third, slightly less common symptom of the coronavirus, is testicular pain. Researchers from  Hard Medical School filed a case report about a -year-old man who tested positive for the virus, after going to hospital with a ‘stabbing pain’ in his testicles. While doctors could find nothing wrong with his  testicles, and CT scan showed damage in his lungs. Two days later, the man was diagnosed with Covid-.  Unfortunately, because the man had atypical symptoms, several other patients and doctors may have unknowingly been exposed to the virus. While it remains unclear whether or not his testicular pain was linked to the virus, other viruses have been known to affect the testicles. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for seven days. You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild.Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others as it can take  days for them to appear. DO NOT go to your GP or hospital. Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice. Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Speaking to  MailOnline, Dr Viney, a surgeon in Birmingham, said: “There are certain viruses that can affect the testicles, such as mumps. “Only time will tellCOVID- also affects the testicles but it isn’t a symptom many of the patients I’ve dealt with have complained about. For most of them, their testicles are the least of their worries.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk missed three chances join","story":"NewsUK missed three chances to join EU scheme to bulk buy protective equipmentBritain reportedly failed to utilise opportunities to get items such as masks, gowns and gloves under an EU initiative.

Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS. It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a process which can take monthsnot years. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections.Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the  Mail on Sunday  reported.The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. It is now being used around the globe in a race against time to find a cure and vaccine for the deadly bug, which has already infected more than .million people around the world and caused , deaths. For Zhengli the disocvery of the coronavirus gene sequence is the culmination of more than  years work, which has made her one of the worldaposs leading scientists in her field. But when the virologist received the fateful call on December  last year, just after the first patient samples had arrived at the lab in Wuhan, she admits she knew she would be about the battle her worst nightmare. And Zhengli had one overriding fear - had the new virus been accidentally unleashed by the lab she worked in. In the  years she had been working with bats, Zhengli had found the subtropical areas of China posed the biggest risk for the coronavirus being transmitted from animals to human - not the centre of the country where Wuhan is located. She said: I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China. I remember thinking aposcould they have come from our lab apos Zhengli was at a conference outside Wuhan when she received the terrying phonecall that would change the course of the world. Two hospital patients had an unusual type of pneumonia and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention needed Zhengliaposs expertise amid fears this new strain of the virus could be a deadly risk to public health. Her director told her to drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now and she was immediately on a train back to the lab in Wuhan. Zhengli and her team worked round the clock to find the genetic code of this new strain of coronavirus as the Covid- spread around the world like wildfire. But it was a moment she had spent her entire career working towards - starting with her first virus expedition back in . Zhengli travelled to bat colonies located in caves near Nanning, which she described as spellbinding. But the work was hard, with long hikes and risky decents into caves to find the creatures - and could often be frustrating. She was part of the team who were searching for the source of the SARS epidemic after a team from Hong Kong had reported that civets, which are similar to mongoose, had been the source of the virus and they were found in the subtropical parts of Asia and Africa. Before SARS the world had been blissfully unaware of the devastating impact of the coronavirus family but the epidemic led to a global push to both learn more and work to prevent a pandemic - and Zhengli was part of that early team. And the one thing that seemed to be key in the outbreak of a coronavirus was that they had started in bats before spreading to other animals and then humans. For months, work on the epedition was relentless with the team waking at dusk to work ovrnight when the bats had left the caves to hunt for food. They would collect blood, saliva and fecal swabs before grabbing a few hours sleep only tothe following morning to collect urine. For weeks there was no sign of coronavirus in the DNA that had been collected. Zhengli was heartbroken. She said: Eight months of hard work seemed to have gone down the drain. We thought coronaviruses probably did not like Chinese bats. At the end of their patience, the team were about tohome when another lab gave them a diagnostic kit for testing antibodies produced by people with SARS. Admitting she didnapost have high hopes it would work, Zhengli said she had nothing to lose by testing the samples and the results were incredible and was a turning project for the scheme. Antibodies against SARS were found in three species of horseshoe bats, which meant they were one step closer to finding the genetic code. After testing a huge number of sites, the team then narrowed their search down to the outskirts of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan and for the next five years they targeted their research on that area. Horryingly, the team discovered hundreds of strains of coronaviruses but thankfully just dozens were similar to SARS, could infect human lungs and were immune to vaccines and cures that had proved successful against other forms of the virus. And finally, in one cave, the scientists found what seemed to be the epicentre for SARS - but this came with an added risk. It meant millions of bats were mixing and creating increasing opportunities for the virus to evolve and for new strains to emerge. They also found that the virus could spread to those who werenapost directly handling the animals. People living in a nearby village had seen bats flying around. Six people had suffered from symptoms similar to SARS. And this was not the only time Zhengli and her team had found evidence bats were spreading a new strain of the deadly virus. Six miners had been struck down with an illness similar to SARS and when Zhengli investigated the mineshaft where they were working, they discovered it was covered in a disgusting-smelling fungus. The mine was closed immediately to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. Zhengli fears that the more humans move into areas previously havens for wildle, the greater the risk of unleashing new coronaviruses on the population. This coupled with the movement of wildle and livestock around the world, along with increased long-haul travel, creates conditions perfect for the potential spread of a pandemic - something Zhengli has long feared. A year ago, Zhengli and her team published a study warning of the potential of a bat-borne pandemic. Little did they know just  months later their doomsday predictions would come true. Then, at the turn of the year, everything they had been preparing for for the last  years suddenly needed to kick into action. Amplying the genetic material of the virus using the polymerase chain reaction technique Zhengli and her team found five of the infected patients had the same genetic sequences found in all coronaviruses. Zhengli admits she didnapost sleep at all during those first few days of frantic testing and a week after the first case had been reported she was certain a new strain of coronavirus has caused the sickness that had killed the patients - and Covid- was born. Chillingly, it also showed there had been just one point where the virus had passed from animals to human and had then spread through human to human contact - until it covered the world. They also found the virus could have been in existance for months but hadnapost started to spread until it reached Wuhan - and its wildle markets where animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls. They sell a range of creatures, such as bats, civets, pangolins, badgers and crocodiles, although Zhengli and her team believe the virus came directly from the bats themselves. Almost two months after the first cases of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China permanently banned wildle consumption and trade. It is estimated this will forced million people out of work and cost the Chinese economy about £billion, however, Zhengli believes the consumption and trade of wildle is not the whole problem. Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves.Le is Wuhan is slowly ing to normal, although China has recorded its highest number of daily new  coronavirus  cases in almost six weeks, sparking fears of a second wave of Covid- after restrictions were eased.A total of  new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from  a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since  infections were reported on March . But for two months Zhengli barely left her lab and survived on nothing but instant noodles as she and her team worked to not only identy the virus but come up with the key to a cure. The found how it gets into human lungs and are now working on drugs that can block it, as well as trying to come up with a vaccine and trial it on people. Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic.

Officials say the sudden rise is due to infected travellers arriving from abroad, many of them crossing the border from Russia. A total of  new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from  a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since  infections were reported on March . Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia in the north-east, has become Chinaaposs new battleground against Covid- as the rise threatens to push the entire country back into a state of near paralysis. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The National Health Commission said  of the new cases - or more than  per cent - were imported, a new record. A total of  Chinese nationals who entered Heilongjiang province from Russia tested positive. Our little town here, we thought it was the safest place, said a resident of the border city of Suenhe, who only gave his surname as Zhu. Some Chinese citizens they want to come back, but itaposs not very sensible, what are you doing coming here for   Though the number of daily infections across China have dropped sharply from the height of the epidemic in February, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. Chinese cities near the border with Russia are tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines in response to influx of infected patients from the country.  Suenhe last week announced restrictions on movements and gatherings similar to those imposed in Wuhan city, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged late last year, and extended the closure of its border with Russia. The land route through the city had become one of few options available for Chinese nationals trying to get into China after Russia stopped all flights to the country.  Suenhe and Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, are now mandating  days of quarantine for all arrivals from abroad as well as nucleic acid and antibody tests. Streets in Suenhe were virtually empty on Sunday evening due to restrictions of movement. Residents said a lot of people had left the city as the number of infected people crossing the border from Russia rose. I donapost need to worry, Zhao Wei, another Suenhe resident, told Reuters. If thereaposs a local transmission, I would, but thereaposs not a single one. Theyaposre all from the border, but theyaposve all been sent to quarantine. In Shanghai, authorities found that  people who arrived on Aeroflot flight SU from Moscow on April  have the coronavirus, Zheng Jin, a spokeswoman for the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, told a press conference on Monday.  China has cut the number of people crossing its borders by  per cent and has tried to stop all non-essential journeys, said Liu Haitao, an immigration official, at a separate briefing on Monday. Our border is long, and apart from the border crossings and passages, there are a large number of mountain passes, paths, ferry crossings and small roads, and the situation is very complicated, he said. Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Center for Diseases Prevention and Control in Beijing, said the trend for local transmission of the disease in the capital was low. Imported cases are still the highest risk in Beijing in the second half of April, Pang said, adding that nearly eight per cent of the , nucleic acid tests carried out in the city since April  had been conducted on people who had come from abroad. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China now stands at , as of Sunday.  At the peak of the first wave of the epidemic on February  there were over , new cases. Though the number of daily infections across China has dropped sharply from that peak, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. China has been accused of underreporting its total number of infections. China hid work of Bat Woman scientist China is accused of hiding the findings of a coronavirus expert - known as Bat Woman - after she quickly identied the genetic make-up of the new strain that has infected millions. Wuhan-based virologist Shi Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS.  It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan. But she was muzzled and her team was ordered not to reveal any information about the new disease, which was already spreading rapidly as China kept the world in the dark. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections. Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the Mail on Sunday reported. The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. The day that the genetic information was mapped, Yanyi Wang, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, ordered staff not to reveal any information about the disease, it is claimed. After local doctors were detained for warning locals about the virus, the director claimed inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing general panic.  She ordered staff not to post any information on social media or speak to the media. Just over a week later, a team in Shanghai published a sequence on an open access  after studying samples from an infected patient. Their laboratory was shut for rectication two days later. One of the earliest Covid- cases emerged in mid-December when a patient, who worked at a wildle market in Wuhan that became the early epicentre of the outbreak, was hospitalised with a double lung infection in the city in central China. The usual treatment for flu-like illness failed to work and new cases soon emerged. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis.

You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. On December , Wuhan health officials were told that the illness was being caused by a new coronavirus. Three days later, at least two doctors from Wuhan - Li Wenliang and Ai Fen - shared information about the new virus on the social network WeChat. Li, a whistleblower who was warned by police to stop making  comments, died in February after contracting the virus. Ai is missing after giving media interviews criticising Chinaaposs censorship and hospital authorities for suppressing early warnings of the outbreak. She told the Chinese magazine, Renwu, or People, that she was reprimanded after alerting her bosses and colleagues of the new virus in December.  On  December, she received the laboratory results of one case which stated: SARS coronavirus. The next day, Wuhan officials confirmed almost  cases, shut down the wildle market and notied the World Health Organisationaposs local office about the mysterious illness. New cases continued to emerge and the outbreak was spreading outside of China, but for a week in January health officials in Wuhan insisted they had not received any new patients. During that time, the first known case outside of China was detected in Thailand and a case was reported in the US as infected people left Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province to travel across the country and around the world. Chinese authorities insisted they hadnapost seen any clear evidence that the virus could be spread from human to human.  By then they had lost control and hospitals were becoming overwhelmed by the rising number of infected patients. Within days Dr Zhong Nanshan, the countryaposs top respiratory expert and the face of its containment effort, revealed that human transmission was taking place. Wuhan and several other cities struggling to contain the virus went into lockdown on January , days before the Lunar New Year holiday, but by then millions of people had left without being screened. That day, Shi Zhengli and her research team published their data identying the illness on a scientic portal before it was published in February by the medical journal Nature. In the weeks that followed the lockdown in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread to and within other countries due to imported cases and community transmission.  China is still censoring academic research into the origins of the new strain of coronavirus. The authorities have placed new restrictions on the publication of research that could shed new light on how it was passed from an animal to a human. All academic papers are being given extra vetting before being submitted for publication, it emerged on Monday. Studies must be approved by the central government before they are shared with the rest of the world, according to since-deleted online posts by two Chinese universities. A researcher told CNN that the new restrictions were another attempt by China to cover up its failures and would likely disrupt important scientic research. The researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, added: I think it is a coordinated effort fromChinese government to controlnarrative, and paint it asthe outbreak did not originate in China. And I donapost think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease. PPE bound for UK held up by red tape Meanwhile, personal protective equipmentis being sent from China to the UK amid shortages at healthcare facilities in Britain and the deaths of almost  NHS workers. However, much of the kit from China is unusable because it fails UK safety checks.  Some shipments are being held up by red tape in China, the worldaposs biggest supplier of PPE, and some are wrongly labelled and do not contain the right gear, it has emerged. For example, a crate is labelled gowns but it contains masks instead. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast there were concerns about a shortage of PPE in some hospitals. Stocks of gowns have run critically low, he added. Mr Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was hand-to-mouth.

He said in a televised address to the nation: Over the next four weeks, the rules must be respected. He also apologised for his government aposnot being prepared enoughapos for the crisis. Were we sufficiently prepared  Obviously not – no one is prepared for a crisis of this magnitude, he said. Macron added that by May , France would be able to test every citizen presenting Covid- symptoms and schools would be gradually reopened. George Eaton, senior online editor for the New Statesman, tweeted: It will be surprisingthe UK doesnapost mirror this. It comes as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab today said that it is far too early to talk about relaxing Covid- lockdown measures in the UK despite positive signs from official data. Speaking at Mondayaposs Downing Street press conference, Mr Raab said figures indicated the UK was starting to win this struggle against the virus but warned it was still not past the peak. He praised the British public for staying at home during the Easter weekend, adding: Our plan is working. Please stick with it and weaposll get through this crisis together.  Meanwhile, Macron admitted his country had not been sufficiently prepared early on to face the challenges posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus, but said the unprecedented restrictions put in place had started showing results. He said: The epidemic is starting to slow down. The results are there. Thanks to your efforts, everyday we have made progress. But our country was not sufficiently ready for this crisis. Franceaposs residents have been under lockdown for four weeks - they must stay at home except to buy food, go to work, seek medical care or get some exercise on their own.  As part of the package of support for people affected by the crisis, he also announced aid for lowest-income families and students. The country will also keep its borders with non-European nations closed until further notice, he said. After a relentless increase until the first week of April, the number of patients in French hospitalsapos intensive care units has started to decline, but nursing homes have reportedly been overwhelmed.  France has so far reported , deaths linked to Covid-, with more than , confirmed cases, according to official figures. Although Macronaposs popularity initially shot up after he followed Italy and Spain in introducing drastic curbs on public le, his government has faced accusations of failing to address a shortage of masks and testing kits. Meanwhile, three weeks into the nation-wide lockdown in the UK Mr Raab said the Government did not expect to make any changes following a review of social-distancing measures by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieslater this week. Mr Raabaposs comments came after the coronavirus-related hospital death toll passed ,, with the Foreign Secretary facing questions over whether more lives could have been savedthe UK had acted faster.  He rejected any like-for-like comparison with other countries, saying it depended on each nationaposs inidual circumstances and how far along the coronavirus outbreak curve they were. But the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the UK would be looking to learn from other countries on how they approach releasing lockdown measures. Questions were also raised about whether the number of coronavirus-related deaths in care homes were being properly recorded.  Englandaposs chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said he wanted testing in the sector to be increased due to the large numbers of vulnerable people at risk. The Department of Health said , people had died in hospitals as of pm on Sunday, with many more expected in care homes. It means the UK has more recorded deaths than any country except the US, Italy, Spain and France.  Mr Raab admitted the government had been concerned that the public might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine over the Easter weekend. But he added: In fact the overwhelming majority of people stayed at home and understood the importance of doing so. By staying home this weekend, youaposve saved lives. Earlier Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman maintained the UK was still on course to carry out the Governmentaposs pledge of , coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month as he said , had been conducted in the  hours to Sunday morning.

The busiest time of the year was always that four-month period between June and October, as the team worked constantly to ensure the admissions process ran smoothly.#It was just mad during that time. I was working a lot of overtime, coming to work in the evenings and catching up but I thoroughly enjoyed it.#There were four of us working in the office at one point.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

need","story":"An Aberdeen children#s charity has seen an % increase in the need for its support services in the past month.Charlie House, which supports children and young people with complex disabilities and or le-limiting conditions and their families, reported the huge increase on its figures in March compared to the same time in February.Due to the outbreak of Covid- and lockdown measures put in place by the UK Government, families have been in self-isolation.Last month, the charity provided support to families on more than  occasions, and continues to support those who need help despite many regular events being cancelled.Leigh Ryrie, children and family support manager at Charlie House, said: “Given these unprecedented times and the impact of Covid-, the services team have been inundated with the need for family support during the month of March.“Periods of isolation for the families we support are not uncommon as even a regular cold can have a serious impact on a child with a complex disability and le-limiting condition, so the families are used to ying degrees of confinement.“However, this period is unprecedented.“Families may have siblings who are no longer in school during the day so they have additional childcare needs at a point when they may no longer be able to receive their regular carers in their home, taking away much-needed respite care when it is more needed than ever.#Couple that with the entire family under one roof and loss of earnings for some and there is a huge additional strain on the families for an unknown period of time.”To help families cope, Charlie House has moved from its normal face-to-face meetings to virtual support via calls, email, video and texts.They are also holding virtual siblings clubs, virtual show and tells and more, as well as delivering isolation packs pre-lockdown.Charlie House’s community nurse is also continuing to provide support from the Royal Aberdeen’s Children’s Hospital.To allow them to continue, Charlie House is urgently appealing for donations, as the cancellation of all its major fundraising events has put huge financial pressure on it."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/5e940dd1957290.49340185-564x564.jpg ","title":"coronavirus north east man tells of lockdown easing in china","story":"A north-east man living in China has told of how the country is starting to get back on its feet.Richie Cormack, who is originally from Ellon, now lives in the city of Hefei – around five hours’ drive from where the coronavirus originated.Having endured several months of lockdown while the Chinese authorities desperately battled to keep the virus under control, le is now beginning toto normal.But Richie, , said people are still fearful of the disease re-emerging.He said: “The lockdown is now over in China, but some businesses like nightclubs are not open yet.“There is a ban on any kind of musical performance or event that would attract crowds.“Senior academy pupils are back in school to prepare for their big exams, but primary, middle and university students are still off.“There is still a sense of fear. The majority of people are still not going out unless it’s for work or essentials.“There are still daily asymptomatic cases of Covid- being found all over China, so the virus has still not been totally wiped out. Many don’t want to risk coming across it and paying the price.”He added: “The government are very determined to convince people it’s safe to go out, to spend money and consume, as they need to spark the economy. But the general public are happier to gradually get back to their normal lives.“There’s an air of distrust of anything public.”Richie, who lives in Hefei with his we Ting Ting and son Dylan, was due to fly back to the north-east later this year for a wedding.However, the virus has put paid to his trip home.He said: “I really can’t wait to get back to Scotland, but at the moment I’m probably in the safest place.“I had flights booked for a wedding in June, but there’s no chance of me making it.“Word on the street is China’s borders will be locked until August and eventhey open before that, I would be quarantined in a Covid hotel for two weeks upon ing to China.”Richie urged people back home in Scotland to adhere to lockdown regulations and make use of protective equipment in order to overcome the virus.He said: “Stay home and wear a mask when you have to go outyou can get them.“It’s that simple, it’s the only way to beat it.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.15847962-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.15847962-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.15847962-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.15847962-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"north east residents win 1000 each peoples postcode lottery draw","story":"Two north-east residents have won £, each.The residents of Rickarton, near Stonehaven, won the prize when AB TH wasPeople’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson said: “Congratulations to our winners!

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass.

A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

I was definitely not expecting it to get as big, but I guess that is how social media works.ldquoI canrsquot believe how much itrsquos spread. All I wanted was two or three people to smile and Irsquove managed to do just that.ldquoIrsquom quite surprised at how many people of all generations it has attracted. Itrsquos bringing them all back to their younger days.ldquoTherersquos some bears that have been posted in the group that are  years old and falling to bits, people are going up into their attics and bringing their own old ones down and are telling stories from when they were a child.ldquoTherersquos been over , comments so far and most of them are people sharing their childhood stories, they arenrsquot even talking about the virus.Jodie said that Lexii has been collecting beanie baby teddy bears since she was born so is ldquovery excited to get them all out.She added: ldquoItrsquos given her that distraction that she needed. Shersquos been out with Steven looking for more.Jodie is in talks with people who can knit bears and is hoping that a bunch can be made and auctioned off, she is hoping this will happen in the next couple of weeks.The bears are going to be NHS bears and will also be raising money for them."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-isolated-not-alone","story":"THIS virus has had a devastating effect on so many people in so many ways. Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

Hotel owners Cameron and Susan Law intend to step down from the business, which has been in the family for  years,the proposals are given the green light.Susan, who was previously chairwoman of Muirfield Riding Therapy, which offers free horseriding for people with disabilities, stressed that The Mallard Hotel would remain open prior to any development.At the time of the public exhibition, she told the Courier: ldquoI think, initially, I was quite shocked that it was going to be knocked down but in retrospect it is the best thing, really.ldquoObviously, we will be sad to see it go but we will take The Mallard Hotel with us, is how I am thinking now.

We produce a range of styles, from classic IPA, Drop, through the multi-award-winning Fathom , Spinnaker , and Drt .We also have Wave, our weissbier, Surf, our pale ale with a twist, and Capsize, our blonde beer.

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

The place was an Aladdinrsquos cave of implements for cutting, sawing, pounding, impaling. If you owned a Texas ranch and had a yearning to renew the fences, everything yoursquod need is here. So tooyou had to exterminate rats or mice, wasps, beetles, or any other pest that was getting in your way. There was a corner devoted to horses, with enough combs, brushes and hoof-picks to tart them up for Ascot. And there were elixirs and ointments and dips not only for horses but for sheep, pigs and cattle.The store is well placed, beside an auction market. Hundreds of metal corrals encircle the trading hub of this historic mart, the first of its kind in Scotland. It was opened in  by a butcher whose we realised he could do better for himself, and persuaded him to go into the auctioning business.Early in the morning, several times a week, farmers pass our cottage, heading for the mart with lorries and trailers packed with cattle and sheep. A short while later they rattle back home empty. In the present lock-down they are almost the only traffic going by, and I picture all us villagers lting our heads from whatever wersquore doing to watch. Tractors are even more exciting. One went past four times in each direction the other Sunday ndash just turning my head made me feel wiped out.At this time of year, tractors are busy harrowing and fertilising, but the most important activity is lambing. Irsquove never understood why, at Easter, we celebrate with chocolate rabbits when it is newly arrived lambs we should be thinking of. Everywhere you look there are picture-book hillsides of grazing ewes, eating asat an all-day buffet, while their infants dance like popcorn all over the place.By March, lambing season is in full swing, and gravelly bleating is, for me, the sound of spring. As daffodils splash verges and woods with colour, lambs cavort with no thought for tomorrow . The other day, on my way home from a hardware store ndash we needed to repair our wood-burning stove ndash we passed a field whose corner had been fenced off to create a maternity ward. The midwersquos caravan was parked among them, presumably making the midnight sht a little less arduous. Two lambs, sitting as close as eggs in a box, stared at me with beady black eyes, so motionless they appeared not even to blink. At a few days old, they were brilliant white, asstraight out of the washing machine. Their mother, in contrast, was a mess. Her filthy fleece hung off her in shreds, like a catwalk model swaggering down the podium, her woolly cape worn so low off the shoulder it almost trips her up.For any ewe about to go into labour, seeing a new mother in such a ragged state can do nothing for their nerves. Nature is meant to take its course easily in the sheep pen, with none of the coaxing, hand-holding or pain relief humans generally need. And when it comes to the farmyard, most of the time thatrsquos how it works. But as anyone who read James Herriot as a youngster knows, things can quickly go wrong. When they do, it iniably requires middle-of-the-night trips to snow-bound barns, and armpit- gloves.Sheep, a vet once told me, are always finding new ways of dying. Whether during pregnancy and birth, or out on the summer hills, their capacity to self-destruct is impressive. I spare you the details over your quailsrsquo eggs and kedgeree. I spent a lot of time, once, talking to hill sheep farmers, shepherds and vets for a book I was writing. Studying a veterinary textbook on ruminants and their ailments, and the photos in particular, was the most effective diet I ever went on.It made me realise how stoical these creatures are, and how much we take them for granted. With our streets empty and silent, and the knowledge of a highly contagious disease on the loose, these eery times are reminiscent of the dreadful Foot and Mouth outbreak in . Back then, throughout East Lothian where I lived, and in Dumfries and Galloway, where friends were farmers, there was a deathly hush in the countryside. The sight of empty green slopes, where there should be flocks and herds, was a definition of abnormal. As was driving through disinfectant at the gates of every farm. Worst of all were Hieronymus Bosch landscapes of smoking pyres. To blot out the sight and smell, farmers closed windows and curtains.Until that calamity I had never fully appreciated how big a part farm animals play in my understanding and enjoyment of the country. Now that it is us who are under threat, the tables are turned. But for all the bucolic charm of seeing lambsrsquo tails whirling like windmills as they suckle, this season is becoming a headache for farmers. Until Covid-, their main worry was the impact Brexit would have on trade deals and the price of home-reared meat. All that seems far off right now. With some abattoirs and most international borders closing, the farm calendar of breeding, rearing and slaughtering is at grave risk of disruption in the coming months. Among the lessons this crisis might teach us is the value of locally grown produce, and the necessity of being as self-sufficient a country as possible.While we get through this unnerving situation, those of us who live within sight and sound of frolicking lambs, or who follow media-savvy shepherds online, are grateful.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form. We can do this using body awareness like I mentioned earlier but it can also be useful to video ourselves doing these exercises, to seewe can spot any issues.So there you have it, three things to keep in mind when doing these exercises:Use old habits to create new habits these exercises are an opportunity to practice movement form takes time and practice to develop.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting.

Normally, this would have looked like playing catch up on Ridgersquos part, but arguably this was a more fitting time to have the MP for Holborn and St Pancras on. As Ridge said in her introduction: ldquoThe UK government is dealing with an unprecedented challenge, but as deaths here rise at a faster rate than in other countries, serious questions are now being asked about the speed of the UK response and what still needs to be done.: What is driving surge in deaths Ridge initially put some of those questions to Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary. In interviewing style, the Sky News presenter prefers a quietly persistent approach to anything more showy. She gets results, or at least tries to, because she listens to the answers and adapts her questioning accordingly.It is an approach you might think was standard, but anyone watching the daily press conference from Downing Street will know that is far from the case. In too many instances, the same questions are asked in similar ways, often to little effect.Whatever Ridge asked, Mr Sharma, in common with every other Minister since the crisis began, held to the line that the government had been following, and would continue to be guided by, scientic advice.So on to Sir Keir, standing outside his home in north London. He had been in the Sunday papers calling for parliament to be recalled after Easter so ldquoserious questions ndashthose again ndash could be asked of the government.As for Ridgersquos questions, he was not keen on saying anything that would look like an attack on the government.ldquoOf course there will be questions in due course about what happened when, but the most important thing is we have that unity of purpose which is to try to get those figures down, he said, referring to the recent death tolls.ldquoWe will support the government in that, we will ask challenging questions, dficult questions about where we go next, about whatrsquos happened in the past, but I think the whole nation desperately wants those figures to go down.: Boris Johnson discharged from hospitalRidge tried again. Was the government too slow to act  Same answer: now is not the time.He did want to know, however, about the governmentrsquos strategy in the months to come. He also had some ideas about how the Commons could operate at a time of social distancing. Having hundreds of MPs together in one place was clearly not an option.ldquoIn New Zealand, they have set up a special select committee to look at coronavirus. It is chaired by the leader of the opposition and it operates on a daily basis using technology so people can see parliament at work.One of the matters such a committee would look at was the ldquomismatch between the government saying there was enough personal protection equipment to go around, and staff reporting shortages. This, he went on, was the kind of ldquoconstructive opposition he had in mind.ldquoI want the government to get this right, I want to support the government to get this right, but we need to point out the dference between what they are saying and the position on the front line so that it can be fixed.On Marr, Lisa Nandy, who had challenged Sir Keir for the Labour leadership, largely walked in step with her new boss. She went further, however, in saying there had been areas where action had not been taken quickly enough, and that was due, in part, to the country being in a ldquoweakened state.ldquoWe should never again be in a position where our public services donrsquot have the resilience they need to respond, where families are only one step away from financial collapse, where workers are struggling to get the rights and protection they need, she said.: Iain Macwhirter on the crisisAll of which sounded highly political. But then she added: ldquoAll of these things are questions for later hellip At the moment we are focused on supporting the government to get through this.Viewersrsquo eyes might have been drawn to a couple of books on a nearby shelf: Fractured Times, by the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, and a certain Joseph Heller novel by the name of Catch-. A coincidence or a fitting summation of politics in these strange days  You decide.There was no disputing what the most chilling moment of the morning had been.Appearing on Marr, Sir Jeremy Farrar, Wellcome Trust director and a senior scientic adviser to the government, said: ldquoThe UK is likely to be one of the worst,not the worst affected country in Europe.

Indeed, some estimates suggest the extra shared cost for the UK could be around pound trillion, which would increase the national debt by  per cent.Basically, this means that there has been a signicant \"material change\" in Scotlands financial position since the last SNP conference when all sorts of fancul promises were made about establishing our own currency and so on. Compounding the problem for an independent Scotland has been the crash in oil prices, which at the current level would produce little or no tax revenues. Furthermore, there are serious isions opening up in the EU with key politicians in Italy and Spain calling for \"common debt\" , otherwise the \"very existence\" of the EU would be at stake.Taking the above into consideration there are now no credible commentators left who believe there is the slightest chance that Scotland could leave the UK or that it would be in our interests to join a ided EU. Perhaps it is now time for Ms Sturgeon to be honest with her followers and explain that there has indeed been a \"material change\", but this time it means they need to accept the cost of leaving the UK is too great for at least a \"generation\" or more to come.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.I FOUND much to agree with in Doug Maughan and Iain Millars lettersabout Labour and its new leadership. In fact,when I read Neil Findlays letterI started to write a reply which began \"Well, thatdidnt last long\".It showed the enormity ndash impossibility, Im beginning to think ndash of the task, and the stupidity and pigheadedness of the people Jackie Bailie, Ian Murray and Sir Keir Starmer are up against.Ive spoken to many Labour supporters, including an MSP, whose needles are stuck in the groove that the SNP wedged them into, marked \"you lost in Scotland because you sided with the Tories in \".No they didnt, they squandered the huge thanks and goodwill of two million No voters by failing to unite in their opposition to Indyref and come up with the leadership and policies to win any of the subsequent elections indeed, as Mr Millar quotes, democratically \"ridding Scotland\" of its SNP Government.And now this capitulation into federalism or more devolution appeasement, an unworkable approachthat was theme of a frustrating speech by Gordon Brown, one of my heroes of , at the recent These Island conference.For all the economic, social, security, Covid, and Brexit reasons that are regularly aired in these columns I disagree with the conclusion that independence is the answer. In fact, Im one of a growing number who think devolution has failed and should be morphed into something more agile and effective.Reduce the bloated  MP and MSP count to  talented MPs, boost the Scottish Offices power in Westminster and power in Scotland by having ministers in political charge of the main devolved departments and a civil service immune to the bullying and patronage that seems to have infected Holyrood.And get behind Andy Burnhams City Region vision that is working so well in Manchester.I have heard it explained at These Islands and a conference run by Aberdeen City and Shire, whose administrations, frustrated by SNP centralised, back the idea.Scottish Labour leaders could do worse than pay a visit to Aberdeen, see how effectively the joint Labour and Conservative administrations are working, copy their ideas and reverse the bulky, vindictive suspension of its Labour group.There is a long way to go.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.IF the Scottish Labour Party is serious about trying to regain lost ground, and to provide a credible opposition to the SNP, it must get rid of its current ineffectual leader, who has been a complete disaster.

His article in Fridays Herald, while no doubt written with the best of intentions, suggests he has absolutely no idea how much work school teams and local authorities are currently doing.In addition to large numbers of teachers and other school staff reporting for work to keep hub schools open for vulnerable pupils and those of key workers ndash many over the Easter break and in some places at weekends ndash huge amounts of work is being done to support home learning.

We are to ldquoreact equally selflessly  I would never ever dispute the extreme hard work, dedication and selflessness of our NHS heroes and key workers across the country. To me, however, this statement insinuates that teachers across the country are not already doing this. Whilst I canrsquot speak for all schools in the UK, my colleagues and I have all, where possible, willingly volunteered to care for children of key workers, putting ourselves at risk each time we enter the school building and increasing our chances of contracting Covid-.On top of that, in the two weeks prior to the holidays as well as the days leading up to the school closures, my colleagues and I worked tirelessly to develop an online learning . Trying to change your practice in that short timeframe is a challenge, I assure you.We spent those two weeks, hours in front of the computer, planning, implementing and marking work, responding to parent queries and questions and sending videos and messages of support and encouragement to our naturally worried pupils.We are now in our school holidays so naturally this is to be a time for rest and recuperation. Not quite ndash we have continued to volunteer our time to be in school, again looking after pupils where families need us most. I couldnrsquot be prouder to support them. Next week, I will have to open my forward plan, film videos and create resources for my pupils ing to ldquoremote learning after the holidays.Next time, Mr Marr ought to show a little consideration for those actually working at the class level just now, who are making the most out of a trying and dficult time for all schools up and down the country.Sacha Taylor, class teacher, Glasgow.Shops across Scotland are closing.

Most of the major pandemics of the last  years began in animal hosts, including the Spanish flu which jumped from birds to humans and HIV, which came from chimps.:Coronavirus in Scotland - Researchers explore impact of virus on bodySince Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was pinpointed as a possible point of origin for coronavirus in late , it has since infected more than a million people across the globe.It has been suggested that pangolins ndash a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater ndash was a staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But new research suggests bats are no more likely to pass on viruses to humans than other animals.The research, led by scientists at the University of Glasgow reveals that the risk of zoonotic viruses - diseases that spread from animals to infect humans - spreading to people is largely the same across erse groups of animals.The findings published to in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America suggest previous scientic thinking that certain animals pose a heightened risk of spreading viruses to humans may not be correct.The researchers say that the findings cast doubt on the idea that bats produce viruses with a \"heightened propensity\" to infect humans.Dr Daniel Streicker, senior research fellow at the Institute of Bioersity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: \"The recognition that several high-profile viruses originated from bats triggered tremendous interest in whether there was something special about their ecology or immune systems which makes their viruses disproportionately likely to infect humans.\"Our finding that the number of zoonoses that have emerged from bats is about what would be expected for any mammalian group of their size casts doubt on the idea that traits of bats produce viruses with a heightened propensity to infect humans.\"Dr Streicker added:\"To knowthere is anything special about bats, we now need to understand whether the bat viruses that do jump to humans cause more severe disease or spread better among humans than viruses from other animals, which is currently uncertain.\"The study, funded by Wellcome, The Royal Society and The Medical Research Council, found that the likelihood of a virus transmitting from animals to humans does not signicantly dfer across  dferent types of bird and mammal.Instead, scientists now believe that it is the characteristic traits of the viruses, rather than their animal hosts, that will be the more useful in predicting whether the virus will be transferred to humans.Dr Nardus Mollentze, research assistant at the universitys Centre for Virus Research, said: \"Although bats will and should remain a focus for viral reservoir research, as the likely origins of major zoonotic pathogens such as SARS-CoV- and Ebola viruses, our work shows that the proportion and number of zoonotic viruses in bats is not unusual compared to other mammalian groups.\"This means that ongoing efforts to identy potential future threats to human health by screening animals for undiscovered viruses will need to focus on a much wider range species than is currently the case.\"Our study also highlights the need to find new traits of viruses that can help us anticipate their zoonotic potential, since knowledge of the current reservoir was not helpful to predict whether a virus might infect humans - even when the reservoir is closely related to humans.\"A year-and-a-half before the current Covid- pandemic, Dr Streicker led a study that showed that machine learning algorithms could predict the natural host of a virus and might help prevent the spread of disease to humans.Identying the natural virus hosts early - which can help prevent the spread to humans - can take years of intensive field research and laboratory work.Those delays make it dficult to implement preventative measures, such as vaccinating animals or preventing contact between species.But he led a group of scientists that found that a new machine learning algorithm could accelerate this process.An algorithmic model accurately predicted the likely host for a broad spectrum of single-source RNA viruses - the viral group which jumps from animals to humans most often.The researchers were able to train machine learning algorithms to match the patterns within viral genomes to the animal they came from. When a virus jumps from a natural host to a human, it leaves a fingerprint from the animal or insect which can be traced back.Over  viruses were studied, and in over  per cent of cases the model correctly predicted the known natural host of the disease. In  per cent of cases, the tool determined whether or not the virus was transmitted by blood-sucking insects, and the type of insect was predicted correctly about  per cent of the time.The model also revealed new leads. Ebola was also thought to have come from bats, but when the team tested two of the four strains of the disease, they found strong evidence that these strains of the virus could also have originated in primates.The team were developing a web application to allow scientists across the globe to submit their virus sequences and recieve predictions for natural hosts and disease transmission routes within minutes.And late last year Dr Streicker was among a group of scientists who pioneered a new technique to help stop the spread of deadly rabies from infected bats to humans.The group glowing fluorescent gel to estimate the potential effectiveness of spreadable vaccines to control diseases in wild bats in South America.Rabies vaccines given to bats can be transferred from one bat to another - however how widely they were spread was not previously known.The fluorescent gel - called Rhodamine b - was applied to bats in three colonies in Peru, where it acted as a marker to simulate the bat-to-bat spread of an oral rabies vaccine.When the gel was ingested by bats that groomed each other, it led to fluorescence in the bats hair follicles, which was then monitored by fluorescent microscopic analysis of hair samples collected by the scientists.Where common vampire bats routinely feed on human blood, rabies is estimated to cause up to  deaths in eve-ry , people, while losses from livestock mortality exceed pound. million annually, disproportionately affecting impoverished, rural communities."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scottish-government-told-clarify-emergency-funding-artists","story":"Labour culture spokesperson Claire Baker has written to Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, appealing for clarity, after Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government has \"provided funding through Creative Scotland for artists and those in the creative sector\".Creative Scotland and Screen Scotland has announced a bridging bursary fund to support freelance creative professionals who have lost earnings due to the cancellation of work during the pandemic.

The family went on to live in the large mansion home of Falcon Hall in Morningside, Edinburgh, from  to  before it was demolished.Full of enthusiasm and far-sightedness, he went on to ensure the firmrsquos success while also building on Scotlandrsquos place in field of cartography.With an instinct for crowd-sourcing that was ahead of his time, Bartholomew came up with a brilliant way of keeping his road maps updated.He invited the Cyclistsrsquo Touring Club of Great Britain to submit route reports to him infor a discount on his maps and the wealth of information that provided allowed him to create road maps that were up-to-date and accurate.Another technique he came up with was the use of coloured shading on maps to show heights.His maps were beautul works of art, with soft greens and browns indicating low-lying areas, darker browns for high ground, and white for mountain summits.Water depth was illustrated by carefully graduating tints of blue.This system was an innovation that Bartholomew worked passionately to establish, and from  onwards it became a much-loved feature of his maps and is still used today.When asked about Barthlomewrsquos greatest achievement, his great-grandson John Eric Bartholomew ndash also a cartographer ndash said: ldquoBeyond a doubt, I have to say his perfection of coloured layer shading on maps, a technique for showing heights now adopted the world over by mapmakers.Bartholomew was also the first map-maker to establish the name of Antarctica on maps. The name first appeared in  when Bartholomew prepared a map to accompany a report to the RSGS by the oceanographer Sir John Murray.The following year, Antarctica was clearly labelled on Bartholomewrsquos Handy Reference Atlas.In , while walking at North Berwick with Agnes Livingstone Bruce, the daughter of David Livingstone, Bartholomew mooted the idea of a Scottish geographical society.The suggestion was well received and a number of Scottish peers, scientists and businessmen stepped in to support the fledgling society.As honorary secretary of the RSGS, Bartholomew welcomed a succession of guest lecturers in the form of eminent explorers and scientists and worked tirelessly to ensure that Scotlandrsquos new geographical society grew in scope and stature.Bartholomew enjoyed close acquaintance with leading academics and travellers of the time, including Sir Ernest Shackleton, Dr William Bruce, HM Stanley, and Cecil Rhodes, and he worked with many of them to represent their discoveries in map form.He collaborated with Sir John Murray to produce the maps from the HMS Challenger expedition, and in the early s he worked with Murray again on a publication on the fresh-water lochs of Scotland.Bartholomewrsquos extraordinary achievements were recognised in  when he was invited to become Geographer and Cartographer to the King for Scotland.He died  years later, in Sintra, Portugal, on April , .To mark the th anniversary of his death, a three-day gathering had been planned in Edinburgh for more than of his direct descendants and cousins to celebrate his le and achievements.However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, this reunion has now been postponed until a date in April next year."},{"url":null,"title":"rules-waived-cannot-access-public-funds-snp-tell-patel","story":"In a letter to Priti Patel and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, SNP MP Stuart McDonald called for more to be done to support those with no recourse to public fundsamid the coronavirus pandemic.:Coronavirus in Scotland: SNP MP defies party by using crisis to push independenceThose who are NRPF cannot claim certain benefits or receive housing from a local authority.The condition is enforced on those who are subject to certain conditions on their stay in the UK.While he welcomed some actions taken to help those who have NRPF, Mr McDonald said some people were being turned away from homeless support sevices, adding that rules should be suspended and funding sent to local authorities to coordinate support for those who need it.He wrote: ldquoInstead of leaving local authorities navigating complex questions about what support can be provided to whom, and using what funding source, a faster and more comprehensive response would simply be to suspend rules prohibiting recourse to public funds and to make direct financial provisions for local authorities to work with those who have NRPF.ldquoI would urge you to make such a change as a matter of urgency.ldquoSuch a change could make an immediate and signicant impact on the ground.He added: ldquoI appreciate that this runs against the tide of years of UK immigration and asylum policy, but exceptional times require exceptional measures, as Portugal has demonstrated.ldquoSaving lives must be the priority ndash it is as simple as that.In his letter, Mr McDonald also called for automatic support for new asylum arrivals deemed to be destitute or those recently denied asylum status who also found themselves without money.He also said there should be support for those in asylum accommodation whose benefits have stopped as well as ldquopublic health assessments of the accommodations.:Jackson Carlaw criticised for indyref comments amid Coronavirus pandemicHe urged Ms Patel to increase the levels of financial support in line with the uptick seen in other benefits as well as the suspension of the breach of conditions policy, which could see a personrsquos actions resulting in benefits being stopped.A UK Government spokesman said: ldquoThe Government is committed to supporting people through this crisis and nobody should find themselves destitute, with pound. billion allocated to local authorities to help the most vulnerable.ldquoMany of the other wide-ranging coronavirus measures we have put in place are not considered public funds and therefore are available to migrants with no recourse to public funds.ldquoThese range from protections for renters from evictions, a mortgage holiday for those who need it, support for the employed and the self-employed and for those on zero-hour contracts, and support for those who are vulnerable and need assistance with access to medication and shopping.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years. Dferent formations may be used, depending on how many defenders, midfielders, or forwards are worthy of inclusion.Email me at j.tait@shetlandtimesyou have any suggestions..."},{"url":null,"title":"call is made for isles to be coronavirus case study ","story":"A councillor is calling on Shetland to be a case study in the fight against coronavirus.South Mainland member George Smith believes a case should be made to the Scottish government for mass testing and contact tracing of the isles population.He believes using Shetland as a test-bed could, in the short term, help both UK and Scottish administrations form an #exit strategy# from the current lockdown arrangements.But he still sees a vaccine as necessary in the longer term.Writing on his councillors Facebook page he states: #This is my personal view and not necessarily the view of Shetland Islands Council. #I think it is obvious that the UK governmentare struggling with an exit strategy from the lockdown arrangements. #The key to relaxing some of the measures will in the short term be testing of the population. Ultimately it will be a vaccine and or drugs to treat patients.#I think Shetland is well placed to be a case study for mass testing. Testing facilities are soon to be available here in Lerwick.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine.

The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

We are delivering on our pledge.At the Budget on March , the Chancellor initially set aside a £bn fund as a rapid response, and said that whatever extra resources needed by the NHS and public services would be provided.News of the extra funding comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued his recovery from Covid- at Chequers in Buckinghamshire after doctors ordered him to rest.The latest analysis from Johns Hopkins University in the US suggested the UK#s case fatality rate, the number of deaths per  confirmed cases, was .%, behind only Italy#s rate of .%.The Ministry of Defence said nearly  members of the armed forces are now being loaned to five NHS ambulance trusts in England to support their work during the pandemic.But the Fire Brigade#s Union warned that nearly , fire and rescue staff are in self-isolation and unable to work.The Government also continued to face pressure over shortages of personal protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, as a growing number of health workers died.The Royal College of Nurses issued new guidance that nurses who could not get adequate PPE should, as a last resort, refuse to work.Speaking on Monday, Dominic Raab, still standing in for the Prime Minister, said: We understand the importance of getting PPE to the front line whether it#s in care homes or the NHS.I think the strongest practical reassurance they will want and that we can give them is that over the Bank Holiday weekend over  million items were delivered and we are straining every sinew to roll them out even further and even faster.Further afield, Spain, which on Sunday reported its lowest daily growth in infections for three weeks, allowed workers toto factories and construction sites.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ruedi Maguire, who creates bespoke occasion wear and wedding guest attire from his boutique RUEDI on Belfast#s Lisburn Road, stepped aside from his couture work to create a rainbow of scrubs for hospital workers.They were funded after he successfully generated £, to cover the cost of material through a Go Fund Me page. The award-winning designer said: This fund has been set up to assist with purchasing fabric to make scrubs and other essential wear needed to help protect our health heroes.Our health services are the front line in the combat against this Covid- and need our help. Currently, they have a huge shortage in scrubs and cotton bags to place them in before leaving work.Mr Maguire and his husband Paul have been working around the clock to ensure they can create and deliver as many scrubs as possible. He told the Belfastrequests from hundreds of healthcare workers have been coming in daily.He said: To date we have made  sets of scrubs at a rate of  sets a day, which is a full roll of poly cotton fabric. I have been informed by a doctor in the City Hospital that their order with another supplier is four to five weeks away, so I will be at this until the supply has caught up with the health service.The designer said the swap from bespoke fashion to workwear has kept my mind in the reality we now live in. He credits Paul for helping him ramp up his production line, adding: Without him I wouldn#t be achieving  a day.After posting a picture of a mannequin clad in the scrubs in his store window on social media, Mr Maguire said he received hundreds of requests from all kinds of health workers, from doctors to community nurses.Mr Maguire said the support from local suppliers and other businesses at this time has been humbling.Ruedi Maguire#s Go Fund Me page can be found at gofundme by searching for Superheroes Wear Scrubs.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aadf .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aadf .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aadf .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aadf .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aadf .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"GalleryCoronavirusFears allayed over quality of £m in PPE gear on way from China Health Minister Robin Swann has moved to allay quality fears about a proposed £m order for personal protection equipmentfrom China by Stormont chiefs.

We should not be clutching at inaccurate straws as to the reason on death rates, said Dr Donnelly.It#s like looking at a car speedometer. If it#s faulty, do we go by what it reads and say that we are right We will find out more about the figures next week when this really hits. Only then should we be looking more closely at the statistics.There are inaccuracies built into the reporting of statistics. Who#s to say how many deaths there have been in the community in each country  Speculation isn#t helpful unless all the facts are laid out before us, and right now that#s not something we can say with any accuracy.There are dferences in reporting between countries.Pointing fingers now, saying this or that would have made a dference, is not something we can realistically do with any certainty at this point.If we look at a country like Canada, it has a relatively small death rate through coronavirus, but it#s essentially a very rural country where the population is spread across widely, similar to Ireland. But we still can#t say for certainthat is a factor. There will be plenty of time afterwards to analyse curves and death rates.It may well suit a government to be putting out the idea that they#re staying on top of this.And when it comes to the timing of school closures, we still don#t know for certainthat had any real benefit. Was it wise to send children home to grandparents and familyit turns out they were carriers of the virus without displaying symptoms There is far too much guesswork about it all at the minute for anyone to be making assertions on which was, or was not the right course of action.I have stated before that the people, the epidemiology , the health systems and the mechanisms of death certication are all dferent, making meaningful comparisons dficult, like comparing apples and oranges to bananas.On her Twitter thread which attracted thousands of responses, Elaine Doyle laid out which she said were the dferences in approach between Ireland and the UK governments to managing the Covid- spread.So you have two English-speaking countries, with close cultural and historical associations, both with underfunded health systems, and comparable levels of ICU bedsgoing into the pandemic.But England has more than . times the deaths  Why  she asked.But wait, it#s worse! Becauseyou compare the per capita death rate between Ireland and England, rather than the UK as a whole, England has almost . times the number of deaths as Ireland .As of Saturday, April , there have been . deaths per , people in Ireland.There have been . deaths per , people in the UK.Ms Doyle was also critical of testing rates across the UK.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Core to that agreement was the resolution of outstanding legacy issues, she insisted.In the #New Decade, New Approach# document, the British Government also reaffirmed their commitment to implementing outstanding legacy legislation.The MLA continued: It must now be implemented fully in a human rights compliant manner. It is unacceptable that some families have waited five decades for the truth. They shouldn#t be forced to wait any longer.Meanwhile, a report published last week by a group of academics from Queen#s University and human rights activists said the latest proposals are incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and the Good Friday Agreement.Some relatives of victims have also expressed concern that any remaining opportunity to hold account those responsible for committing killings will be taken away.

Its the time when things start to become very real, yet its a Hadrians Wall we all have to get over. The worry about what happens when the small talk runs out, only to be replaced with an uncomfortable silence. I didnt have that problem. Minutes into my visit, I was on the pigs back. One of the things I remember – apart from the never-ending flow of tea – was Paulines mother Bridie talking about school days in St Patricks Maghera, where she worked for  years. googletag.cmd.push The other was her father Patsy having the same fanaticism with talking football as I did. Hours later, a thousand balls were kicked, championships were won and lost, an th cup of tea was thrust in my direction before I headed for home. With the current social distancing, we are now talking in the window , yet little has changed. Before the more stringent lock-down, you were offered tea as soon as you land on the street with some of the weeks essentials and the chat has changed towards sporting nostalgia. “Mickey might make use of these,” Bridie said to Pauline on a visit, before the the lock-down. Yes that Mickey is me, but thats another story. googletag.cmd.push It was another stash of Maghera school magazines, The Patrician, going back to the early s. And low and behold, as I searched frantically for a photo of Niall Mullan to go with this weeks feature on Derry hurlings glory days, there he was in full flow in the  Patrician. TIME FOR CHANGE Like every media outlet, producing the County Derry Posts sport section has taken a change of direction. It involves more delving and conjuring. Gone are the reports and round-ups from the club league. The athletics, soccer and rugby seasons are on hold. The local cycling clubs have came to a halt. Now it is all about nostalgia. In these testing times, it gives our readers a chance to reflect on the past. We are living in unprecedented times. It takes a bit of readjusting, but sports writers are the lucky ones. We have a mountain of material out there – just begging to be sourced. There are stories waiting to be told. When researching Colum Rocks impact on Loups underage success of the early s, his nephew Ronan handed me a bag of scrapbooks. It was simply unbelievable. I am not from Loup, but it was compelling reading. Newspaper cuttings of match reports, previews and pen-pics. There was even a summary of each season and hopes of the next. I was relieved to leave them back. If I had lost them....lets just say, you couldnt replace them. For the Bellaghy piece a few weeks ago, Joe Cassidy was able to head to his father and mothers house in Ballynease and dig through the memories. If the walls could talk, they would tell the entire Bellaghy story, as well as the Derry pathway of their sons Joe and Damian. In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before. My first visit to Patsy and Bridie Kennedy taught me well. Get the kettle boiled as soon as you can and lt the lid on all the great moments from the past. We need conversation, positivity and nostalgia more than ever. RELATED - Sideline Views Derry team with a dference. Click here...

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal.

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus.

Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals.

Derry are due to play Offaly in the opening game of the Christy Ring Cup on the weekend of May  .The GAA are currently keeping an eye on government on both sides of the border before any decision is made.“When we get an indication from them of when things are likely toto some kind of normality, well then be able to make decisions both on the structure of an inter-county championship and when that would start,” McGill added.It is likely the Super s wont be played and the hurling championship will revert to knock-out.In terms of club activity, McGill said there was no truth in the speculation that club championships are being planned for the months of June and July.“If there is going to be a period when there is going to be a restriction on attendances, then perhaps we may look at a period of club activitybefore the inter-county championships start. But we are staring into the unknown,” concluded McGill, who is part of the senior football management team of his native Bornacoola in Leitrim.On March , Derry CCC informed clubs they would get two or three weeks to prepare for any resumption of activity.“From talking to Stephenand people in other counties, they are all keen to allow a lead-in until any seriousgames,” McGill added.The GAA have a desire to complete rounds six and seven of the inter-county football leagues and the ision two and three finals in hurling to enable the association to get off on a good footing next season.“The bottom line is, no decisions have been taken yet” he concluded. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Conlan calls for GAA to take a lead.

He said he would need my name, address and date of birth. I said I’d already given that to the police. “I explained that I wanted to come in and recty it and that the police were sitting outsideneeded, but he handed me a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery.” The notice explained that Tesco’s solicitors could write to Maggie to recover the costs of investigating the incident, and there was further punishment in store. “They said I was barred for a year.

Bishop McKeown visited the cemetery at dawn to sprinkle graves using Easter Water that was blessed in St Eugene’s Cathedral during the Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday night. The visit was arranged in co-operation with Derry City and Strabane District Council. Bishop McKeown said he hoped the Easter Blessing would bring some comfort to grieving families across the Derry Diocese who are unable to visit the graves of their loved ones. He said he was very aware that the government legislation that forced all cemeteries and burial grounds to close for visitors, was a dficult one for many people, but he urged the public to be mindful of their own health and welfare and to take heed of the government advice to Stay at Home. googletag.cmd.push He urged people to have faith and to remember their loved ones through prayer and reflection and encouraged the public to care for one another during this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab. For crews that operate as one driver and two loaders, the loaders are transported behind the collection lorry in a support vehicle.ldquoLoaders are also asked to limit their time in cabs to an absolute minimum and can be collected and drop-off points along designated routes.Cllr Casey said the local authority is constantly reviewing its services in light of ldquorapidly changing events and may make further changes at very short notice.He said the current situation remains challenging and is dependent on the ongoing impact of COVID- on council employees.The chairman continued: ldquoWe would like to thank all our frontline workers who continue to engage with our residents to deliver essential services.ldquoI fully appreciate the disruption this has had on normal working routines. However, as a workforce and a wider-society we are now having to make signicant changes to our daily lives. I would also like to thank the public for their support and patience during very dficult circumstances.:Cllr Casey added: ldquoWith our household recycling centres now closed to free up resources needed to maintain domestic refuse collection services and help ensure compliance with social distancing guidance, we are appealing to people not to fly-tip and to do their bit to keep the district clean and safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 County.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to be community hub  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre has been transformed into a new community co-ordination hub to ensure that vulnerable residents across the district receive essential supplies.Set up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Downpatrick hub is one of three that have been established across the local authority areas.Others have opened in Kilkeel and Newry but the distribution centres are not open to members of the public or community groups.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub which is to play a key role in delivering the service on the ground.Down Leisure Centre mdash which has been closed to the public for the past month as a result of global pandemic mdash has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff will be redeployed to work across all sites and work alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff training is currently underway for those who will be working in split shts at the centres while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The service was formally launched on Monday across the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas, with deliveries expected to centre on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11245106.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...However, the statement implied that Sinn Fein’s objection was on procedural grounds rather than because in principle it opposed any Army role. Ms O’Neill said that “we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives” but added that Mr Swann “has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure that ventilators and le saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most”.In an interview with RTE on Saturday, Ms O’Neill said “we have to do everything necessary to save lives”, but then went on to say: “I don’t believe that British Army assistance is necessary at this point. I believe that all of our modelling indicates that we are coping, albeit in the most challenging of circumstances.”Three weeks ago in the Assembly Mr Swann said that his focus was on saving as many lives as possible and he would accept help from wherever it could be found.He told MLAs: “I’ll use whatever tool I have at my disposal to tackle this virus. If the Irish Army want to come up and help us too when they’ve it sorted down there, I’d be more than happy to welcome them.”DUP Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots said that Sinn Fein was not actually trying to stop the Army being involved, but accused it of a “silly PR stunt”.In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr Poots said: “Michelle O’Neill would be better seeking a meeting with the republicans in her own constituency who entirely ignore social distancing than engaging in silly PR stunts about something she in reality has no intention of trying to stop.“Robin has my support in doing whatever needs done, however it is done, by whomever it is done.”With the exception of Sinn Fein, every other Executive party publicly endorsed Mr Swann’s attempt to secure support from the military in the battle against the pandemic.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said on Saturday: “Fteen people died of coronavirus overnight in the North. I’ll support anything that gets PPE and ventilators to where it needs to go. Let’s stop playing politics and do whatever it takes to save lives.”Responding to Mr Eastwood’s comments on Twitter, Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “Could not agree more. Robin Swann has my and the Alliance Party’s full support for taking extraordinary measures to try to save people’s lives. All and any help is welcome at this critical time.”First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “Northern Ireland has been working together on tackling this awful disease. We need to keep at it.“When your loved one is lying in hospital, who built the ward will be the last thought on their mind. Let’s build the capacity we need. We fully support the Army being used to build necessary beds.”Ulster Unionist MLA and Royal Irish Regiment reservist Doug Beattie said that Sinn Fein’s rejection of help from the Army was “becoming absolutely tiresome”. He highlighted that the military had in recent weeks already been used by Stormont to create a temporary morgue, without objection from republicans.He added: “I guess few will complainpersonal protection equipment or ventilators are supplied via a military driver or a civilian driver orthe doctor and nurse treating them is military or not.”As in most countries battling the pandemic, the Army has been increasingly involved in the effort to assist health staff as they have become stretched.At the weekend the Ministry of Defence said that nearly  members of the armed forces are being loaned to NHS ambulance services to support their work.Personnel from all three strands of the armed forces will be sent to work at five ambulance trusts.Although their responsibilities will y depending on the area, the new duties will include driving ambulances and taking calls from the public.Eighty service personnel will be sent to the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust where they will drive emergency response vehicles, larger ambulances and work at the response centre which covers five counties around London.In London,  medical personnel from the armed forces will form  critical care transfer teams to transport patients who need to be moved between intensive care units.Engineers from the Army are also supporting the London Ambulance Service to maintain suction units used in ambulances.In Wales,  soldiers finished their two-day ambulance training at the Sennybridge Training Camp near Brecon on April , ready to be deployed across Wales to assist paramedics with non-clinical tasks.Thirty-seven military personnel have been deployed to the East of England Ambulance Service, which covers six counties including Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, to assist with tasks including driving and logistics.The group all volunteer as emergency responders in their free time and have previously trained with the service.Members of the RAF are already assisting the Scottish Ambulance Service with a trial of a medical isolation and transport system, using RAF Puma helicopters to take critically ill people to hospital.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Our armed forces always step forward at the appearance of threats to the country and its people.“Across the United Kingdom, soldiers, sailors, airmen and women have got the backs of our NHS colleagues as they confront coronavirus.”Members of the armed forces have helped with the response to the outbreak in a iety of other ways.Military personnel were involved in the planning and building of the first NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel exhibition centre in east London, as well as its equivalents across the country.Armed forces personnel made up of  drivers and  driver’s mates have also been trained to fill and transport oxygen tankers to NHS facilities.The Ministry of Defence said there are hundreds of personnel delivering supplies of PPE for the NHS based at distribution centres across the country, amid reported shortages of the vital equipment.Speaking on Friday night, Mr Swann told this newspaper that he hoped the military request would not be isive, repeating his view that the only thing that will ide people in this pandemic is whether they live or die.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital

These communications are ongoing.“Prospective PPE supply routes from China for Northern Ireland have not been finalised.

And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
