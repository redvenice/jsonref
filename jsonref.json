The BBC put Evans onto the Radio 2 breakfast show eight years agoIt is also a huge disappointment to the audience when someone leaves a role they do brilliantly well. Evans is one of the all-time greats of radio presentation, and still firing on all cylinders. His worth seems more apparent than ever in the times we\u0027re living through. While the news programmes chunter on about the ups and downs of Westminster politics or the latest warnings from Brussels about Brexit, and the world seems gloomier by the day, Evans\u0027s show is sunny and high-spirited.Some may still resist his charms, but for an overwhelming majority he has created a morning family — reinforced by the way he involves his own children as a modern, slightly imperfect dad.This week, once again, his nine-year-old son Noah has been asking some of the questions and assisting with corny jokes that show every sign of having been supplied by his father. But on these airwaves there are no domestic rows and the energy level is always fizzing.          Chris Evans and his wife, Natasha, leave Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey with their newborn twins, and Eli, six, and Noah, nineThis is no mean achievement for someone starting at 6.30am for a three-hour show, five days a week and Evans attracts an audience of all ages.The students I talk to as Master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, will mention Evans\u0027 name much more frequently than those of the news agenda-setters on Radio 4 or whoever is currently doing the Radio 1 breakfast show.The sobbing you hear is therefore not just from listeners but from BBC bosses who are losing one of their main assets to a direct rival.The Evans ratings have had a slight wobble recently and dipped below 9 million a week, but they still beat all other radio programmes and are two million ahead of Radio 4\u0027s flagship Today. They also dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world.This success shouldn\u0027t obscure the gamble that the BBC took in putting Evans onto the Radio 2 breakfast show eight years ago.He was taking over from the ultimate broadcasting icon, Sir Terry Wogan and there was the starkest of contrasts between a laid-back wordsmith Irishman and a hyperactive and sometimes rebellious DJ who had made his reputation in shows for young people.The shift was from Wogan\u0027s one-to-one conversational style into Evans\u0027 morning \u0027zoo\u0027 with seemingly a cast of thousands but what they both had was a warmth and an invitation to be part of their club, and that has retained the loyalty of listeners.I had some experience of the Evans\u0027 style when he was part of the line-up for the London 2012 Olympics, which I was running for the BBC.We wanted to build up excitement for the Games across all the BBC\u0027s services, and Evans did that in spades on Radio 2. His show was relocated to the Olympic Park, and I went along for the duty \u0027BBC suit\u0027 interview on the morning of the opening ceremony.I\u0027m taking a guess that there were a few million other people he\u0027d rather have been talking to, but he was glowing in his welcome without being sycophantic and impishly intelligent in his questioning. It was one of those rare occasions when a boss could be part of a feelgood experience.Like Wogan, he makes you feel part of his clubBut the flip side of the Evans Olympic experience happened later in the Games. BBC management had taken a tough line in resisting a bombardment of suggestions from Downing Street that the then prime minister David Cameron would be the perfect guest for our Olympic programming.There must have been something about the record audiences on TV and radio, and the national exuberance, that the Conservatives wanted to convert into political advantage – and we were determined to keep this kind of politics away from the sport.We bopped on the head every offer from No. 10, and we sternly told producers that interview bids for the PM were not allowed.    Evans is seen out and about this week in London. His audience figures dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world, ex-BBC bigwig Roger Mosey saysIt therefore came as something of a surprise to wake up in my BBC-rented flat in Hackney one morning during the Games to hear David Cameron chirping away happily on the Chris Evans show — and not from Downing Street but from the Olympic Park, where he had been respectfully let in by our security team.There were some perfectly fair questions from his host, but Cameron was living Downing Street\u0027s dream: linking himself with the success of the Games on the nation\u0027s most popular radio show.A good old-fashioned internal BBC row then took place.From Prince Harry to pop queens, he has pulling powerOn our morning editorial conference call with the director-general, the Evans show was in the dock. Decrees of condemnation were issued instant inquests were launched. The circumstances were murky, but it seemed that this was largely Evans\u0027 own initiative.In normal circumstances, we would have been delighted that a presenter had the kind of contacts that could get the prime minister into a peak-time special appearance and, six years on, I would give Evans full credit for that if not for adherence to editorial policy.Evans\u0027 pulling power has continued with Prince Harry as a studio guest announcing the Invictus Games for wounded, injured or sick service personnel and veterans, or helping out with the travel news in contemporary royal fashion, alongside the daily interviews with the more routine kings and queens of pop.BBC bosses are accused of using Katya and Seann Walsh kiss...Convicted sex offender who told vigilantes it \u0027doesn\u0027t...Share this articleInsiders say that it is not always a bed of roses working on the Evans show.His rebelliousness was at its peak in his Radio 1 days when he had a falling out with his boss, whom he nicknamed on air as \u0027the fat controller\u0027.He is reported to have mellowed with age, but \u0027a rollercoaster\u0027 is one description of a typical working day when he moved to Radio 2.Evans drives himself hard and has a head full of creative ideas, and it can be a tough ask for the people charged with turning those into programme items.The bad times could be pretty bad, say some, though characteristically the rewards from Evans were high, too. A team Christmas dinner, at his expense, would shun all the BBC-favoured restaurants around Broadcasting House and be held at a luxurious Heston Blumenthal restaurant instead.Perhaps it\u0027s no surprise that many of Evans\u0027 team are moving with him to Virgin.Mind you, Evans can afford the largesse. His wealth is estimated in the Sunday Times Rich List at more than £50million, and at his peak he was earning more than £2.2m a year from the BBC.

Guzman is shown in 2016 (left) and in a December 10 courtroom sketch (right)All did so in a coldly calculated betrayal of Guzman that could benefit them in their own drug cases but the defense says also destroys their credibility. Flores, for one, bottom-lined how he flipped on a kingpin this way: \u0027I was trying to set him up.\u0027Martinez, 52, was in court on December 10, testifying that, starting in 2000, he oversaw a Guzman scheme to transport cocaine all the way from Mexico to the New York City area by train using cooking oil tankers with secret compartments. He estimated he made as much as $20million from the cocaine train operation before he decided to quit because of \u0027too much pressure\u0027 from Guzman over losses from seizures.\u0027They wanted to kill me because I had lost the train route,\u0027 Martinez said. \u0027I just didn\u0027t want to keep going.\u0027While on the stand, Martinez - who made more money than he knew what to do with - said that he had used some of the cash to buy soccer teams in Mexico, earning him the nickname \u0027El Futbolista,\u0027 which means \u0027soccer player\u0027.           A courtroom drawing of Pedro Flores (right) testifying during Guzman\u0027s trial on December 18  Pedro Flores (left) and twin brother Margarito Flores, were known as \u0027the twins\u0027 in the Sinaloa cartel circle. Guzman sought them out for their expertise in distributing cocaine to urban centers in the U.S.     Jorge Milton Cifuentes Villa was among those testifying against former boss Guzman during his Brooklyn trial. Cifuentes is seen here in 2012 as he\u0027s deported from Venezuela to Columbia          Tirso Martinez Sanchez (on December 10) testified about running a cocaine train for GuzmanNotorious drug lord El Chapo is reduced to TEARS after...Actress Kate del Castillo sues the Mexican government for...Share this articleThe downside of all that drug train wealth, however, was a gambling habit that led him to lose a bundle betting on cock fights.Martinez also told the courtroom about  some of the occupational hazards of living life as an outlaw: He said one of his former bosses shot himself in the head in a drunken ploy to avoid arrest, while another died on the operating table during a plastic surgery procedure to alter his appearance - an outcome that didn\u0027t stop Martinez from getting his own face redone.Unlike Martinez, 55-year-old Cifuentes seemed to have had a slightly less flashy experience while working for Guzman. During his testimony December 13, Cifuentes outlined extreme family dysfunction, describing how his father drafted him at just four years old to help move illegal cigarettes and booze through the port in Medellin, Colombia.Cifuentes testified that many of his eight siblings were in the drug trade and that they had \u0027conflicts like any other family.\u0027 He admitted on cross-examination that his brother had ordered the killing of his nephew, but he explained it was because the nephew wanted to kidnap his own grandmother.Cifuentes eventually began shipping Colombian cocaine to the Sinaloa cartel using airplanes made of carbon to deflect radar detection. He described meeting Guzman at his ranch in 2003 where there was a celebration for the second anniversary of the the drug lord\u0027s escape from prison.Getting there wasn\u0027t easy: A small plane took him to a landing strip that was so short and sharply inclined that he started praying and telling himself that if he survived he would buy Guzman a helicopter so he \u0027would fly in a more civilized way.\u0027          Guzman (in 2016) faces life behind bars if convicted of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, murder conspiracy, and other charges          Guzman (in January 2017) as he\u0027s extradited from Mexico to the US to face charges in New YorkAt another meeting in 2009, Cifuentes said he shared a joint with Guzman, who asked how strong it was before he took a smoke. He wasn\u0027t impressed. \u0027This does nothing to me,\u0027 he said. Also testifying against Guzman recently was Pedro Flores. He and his twin brother, Margarito Flores, were known simply as \u0027the twins\u0027 in Sinaloa cartel circle - identical twin brothers from the streets of Chicago who became so good at distributing cocaine to urban centers in the U.S. that Guzman sought them out.Pedro took the witness stand December 18 to testify about their wildly lucrative business partnership with Guzman, still exhibiting a sense of awe about the defendant not shown by more-hardened cooperators. While others simply referred to Guzman as Chapo, Spanish for \u0027shorty,\u0027 Pedro kept calling him \u0027The Man.\u0027Pedro, 37, described how, after becoming a fugitive in Mexico, he and his brother continued running their U.S. network with enough success that he was summoned to a meeting with Guzman in mountains in Sinaloa. He and Guzman\u0027s cohorts were driving up a road to the compound when he was startled to see a naked man, apparently being tortured.\u0027He was tied to a tree with a chain,\u0027 Perdo said, adding that he never learned what happened to him.In another odd twist, he recounted discussing concerns about the \u0027cover loads\u0027 used to disguise drug shipments stashed in trucks - in this instance, 150 live sheep he had to pay $10,000 to put out to pasture.The stresses of the job and the dangers of a bloody civil war within the cartel convinced Pedro to commit mutiny by contacting U.S narcotics agents. He agreed to record telephone calls, played for the jury, in which an unsuspecting Guzman could be heard calling him his \u0027amigo.\u0027By associating with Guzman, Pedro said, \u0027I couldn\u0027t promise my family a tomorrow, you know?\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Corbyn criticised saying ahead Brexit PM","story":"    JK Rowling struck out at Jeremy Corbyn in a biblical-style series of tweetsJK Rowling struck out at Jeremy Corbyn in a biblical-style series of tweets after the Labour leader said he would pursue Brexit if his party won a snap election.  Remain supporters heaped criticism on Mr Corbyn after he said he would recommend his party \u0027go back and renegotiate\u0027 a Brexit deal in time for Britain to leave the EU.Speaking to the Guardian, the Leader of the Opposition failed to  commit his party to backing Remain if a second referendum was called - and hit out at EU laws on state aid which he said blocked investment.But his remarks were attacked by the Harry Potter author in a 16-part Twitter thread she titled \u0027The Visitation of The Corbynites\u0027.After criticising \u0027Saint Jeremy\u0027 in her opening tweets, Ms Rowling continued: \u0027And she did answer, How shall the poor fare under Brexit, which thy Saint hath always in his secret heart desired, yet he hath not admitted what was in his heart, lest fewer attend his next Sermon on the Glastonbury B Stage. \u0027And they did answer, Saint Jeremy will achieve a miracle, and he shall bring forth a Jobs First Brexit and all the land shall rejoice.

But then few doubt that a froideur between the two duchesses does exist, even if it has sometimes been overplayed. Sources say Meghan and Kate are \u0027very different people\u0027 and simply \u0027don\u0027t get on\u0027. It also emerged that Kate was left \u0027in tears\u0027 after a fitting for Princess Charlotte\u0027s bridesmaid\u0027s dress before Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding in May.One Royal insider gives a prosaic explanation for the Sussexes\u0027 seasonal sleeping arrangements. Last Christmas it was felt that allowing Harry and Meghan, then unmarried, to spend the night at the main house would be inappropriate. Inviting Meghan to share in the festivities in the first place had been a break with convention – there was no need to shatter protocol completely. Anmer Hall offered the perfect solution.But their marriage changed everything. It would now be unusual, said the source, for the couple not to stay with the Queen.Even so, it is a decision that will inevitably stoke further speculation. Certainly it is unlikely to halt the drip, drip of \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027 stories.How Meghan, naturally forthright, must be struggling to hold her tongue.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stayed with the Cambridges at the nearby Anmer Hall (pictured) last ChristmasIt was reported last week that she put paid to her husband\u0027s plans to join the traditional Boxing Day pheasant shoot at Sandringham, just as she did last year, because of her opposition to bloodsports.Insiders now say this claim, which adds another layer to the notion of Meghan as dictatorial – \u0027What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,\u0027 as Harry is said to have put it – is wrong.Harry did indeed miss last year\u0027s shoot, but only because he had to drive to London for a meeting the following day. And this year nothing has yet been decided, according to a Palace source.True, the Duchess is an ardent animal lover but she is understood to be relaxed about Harry\u0027s hobby. So much so that on several occasions this year she has accompanied her husband on shoots, even though she has not actively participated herself. The most recent was earlier this month at a friend\u0027s Wiltshire estate.A source said shooting is \u0027ingrained in Harry\u0027s nature\u0027, adding that \u0027Meghan would never try to change that about him\u0027.The only public window into the Royal Family\u0027s Christmas will be the 11am annual outing to St Mary Magdalene Church on the big day itself. After last year\u0027s service, Meghan clung to Harry\u0027s arm, walking among the crowds alongside William and Kate, cementing her place in the so-called \u0027Fab Four\u0027.          One Royal insider said it was felt last year that allowing Harry and Meghan, then unmarried, to spend the night at the main house would be inappropriateThe message from senior courtiers is to expect the same united front this year, not to mention some carefully chosen outfits. With every scrap of body language likely to be scrutinised, neither duchess is likely to betray any hint of friction.Meghan is an actress after all, and the Duchess of Cambridge is also a seasoned performer who rarely puts a foot wrong.\u0027It will all be friendly – there is no way that you are going to be unfriendly to someone on Christmas Day,\u0027 said an insider. \u0027Especially when Meghan looks like she is about to have a baby at any minute. All will be smiles.\u0027There was one small hitch outside the church last year. Meghan\u0027s curtsy to the Queen ended up being more of a wobbly bob. In comparison, Kate\u0027s was executed perfectly. It is impossible to imagine that the Duchess of Sussex will make the same mistake this year.The regimented schedule begins on Christmas Eve when the Royal clan arrive at Sandringham in order of seniority, with Charles and Camilla the last to appear, mid-afternoon. This prevents the chaos of everyone pitching up at the same time and limits pressure on staff.Despite the scale of the event, the Queen is keen that as many staff as possible enjoy Christmas with their own families, and has a scaled-down retinue.          But Harry and Meghan\u0027s move to Sandringham could be interpreted as a snub amid rumours of tension between the two couplesOn arrival, the Royals are shown to their rooms. There are thought to be 29 bedrooms in the house, including some for staff.Each of the Queen\u0027s children have their own room. Her grandchildren are all treated equally. Those likely to have servants\u0027 rooms include the Queen\u0027s nephew, the Earl of Snowdon, his wife Serena and their children. His sister Lady Sarah Chatto, her husband Daniel and two children are also likely to be included.The family follow the German tradition of opening presents on Christmas Eve. Small jokey gifts are preferred. Harry was once given a \u0027grow-your-own girlfriend\u0027 kit from Kate, while he is said to have given his grandmother a shower cap.Princess Diana famously made a faux pas during her first Christmas by attempting to impress with cashmere sweaters.A source said: \u0027The Royal Family is very frugal when it comes to Christmas, it tends to be nothing lavish – that is taboo. With the children, it is slightly different – they will get the sort of presents most children expect.\u0027After briefly retiring to their rooms, the family reappear for a black-tie dinner. The Duke of Edinburgh, now 97, will spend some time at Wood Farm on the estate, a modest refuge of tranquillity that he has enjoyed for many years.He was seen nearby yesterday, driving himself around in a Land Rover. But tomorrow he will join the Queen in the main house.Across Christmas, numerous outfit changes are required, with the Duchess of York once complaining that she was obliged to change her clothes seven times in 24 hours.While this will probably not be a concern for fashion addict Meghan, she will have to adhere to the usual Royal dress code – particularly as a house guest of the Queen. The black nail polish she showcased at a recent awards ceremony would be considered attention-seeking.Next morning the Royals wake up to stockings by their beds filled with small gifts and fruit, before enjoying a full English breakfast served at around 8am. Getting ready for church is the next task. After the service, which Prince Philip is expected to attend this year, everyone returns to the main house for drinks before Christmas lunch.Despite the formality of the occasion, there is no seating plan and no starter.Guests are served turkey, which is carved by the head chef at the table, followed by Christmas pudding and a cheese course.There may be time for the family to wander around the grounds, but they are back by 3pm for the Queen\u0027s Christmas message. After a tea at 4pm, featuring Christmas cake, mince pies and a chocolate yule log, Meghan – who is luckily eating for two – will sit down to another meal at 8pm a buffet of cold meats, salads and potatoes.          After Christmas, the Cambridges are expected to take George, Charlotte and Louis to the Middleton home in Bucklebury, BerkshireThe family will always find time for parlour games, with charades a particular favourite.The rules continue until bedtime, with no one allowed to retire before Her Majesty, who has been known to stay up until midnight.A Royal insider said: \u0027Everybody is on parade when they go to Sandringham. This is not a family sitting around having a jolly time relaxing. They are all eyeing each other up and seeing who is up and who is down the pecking order. It\u0027s full of tension.\u0027Rather like Camilla, who is said to hate Sandringham, Harry and Meghan will be out of the door as fast as they possibly can.\u0027After Christmas, the Cambridges are expected to take George, Charlotte and Louis to the Middleton home in Bucklebury, Berkshire.The Sussexes, meanwhile, will probably head to their bolthole in the Cotswolds. It is likely that at some point they will see Doria, Meghan\u0027s mother, who last week was still in Los Angeles but is expected to be flying in to the UK at some point during the holiday.While Doria would have been made welcome at Sandringham she will not be attending the activities there.\u0027Meghan certainty wants her mother around at Christmas, particularly as her father is making such a nuisance of himself at the moment,\u0027 said the insider.\u0027Meghan is isolated, things aren\u0027t going as well as they should be – she needs her mum.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Lin Manuel Miranda missed chance perform Hamilton Beyonc Jay Z fever","story":"    The Hamilton genius shared his misfortune while discussing the musical\u0027s impact on the Graham Norton Show on Friday nightMiranda was mentioning how tough it was to do the eight-performances-a-week while also dealing with the growing popularity of the show. He added: \u0027My wife was like, Stay in bed!\u0027 But I was like, I can do it, I can do it!

Admiring colleagues called it the ‘bang! wallop!’ approach.His breakthrough came when the party captured Eastbourne from the Tories in October 1990, in the wake of the IRA killing of Ian Gow, Mrs Thatcher’s parliamentary private secretary.Ashdown polled as the most popular leader of a national party.When it was disclosed in 1992 that he had had a five-month affair with his former secretary, Patricia Howard, the ‘Paddy Pantsdown’ monicker led to a torrent of mocking headlines but, perversely, a further increase in his personal poll ratings.          Ashdown, right, pictured in Borneo, was also in the Special Boat Service His wife of 30 years, Jane, forgave him, however, and his constituency party rallied to his support.He went on to turn the party into a political force that could not be ignored during the late 1990s, at the same time as Tony Blair was performing similar feats with Labour.    The Sun dubbed him \u0027Paddy Pantsdown\u0027 after breaking news of the five-month affair he had with his secretary, although the former Commando changed his answer machine message as a result of the scandal to \u0027Hello, this is Paddy Ashdown. Please leave a message after the high moral tone\u0027          Yet, despite the affair, Ashdown\u0027s wife Jane, left, stood by her husband, right, who continued as Lib Dem leader until 1998And the two forces nearly combined: after Ashdown announced his decision to quit as party leader in 1999, boasting that he had brought it in the space of 12 years from near-extinction to a position in 1997 with 46 MPs in the House of Commons, it was revealed that he had been involved in secret ‘coalition’ talks with Blair before the 1997 General Election in which Labour secured a landslide victory.But Blair decided that Ashdown’s lack of experience in running a big department counted against him. His hopes for a big international post, such as leading Nato, were also scotched.Instead, he evolved into a grandee figurehead for the party, commanding a level of respect which his successors could never match.Born Jeremy John Durham Ashdown in Delhi in 1941 to an Irish family, he preferred the homespun Paddy, his schoolboy nickname.          Ashdown was a hugely-respected figure on the world stage despite never being a Government minister He was described as a swashbuckling, rangy and handsome figure, who became the youngest commander in the SBS after joining the Royal Marines in 1959. After learning Malay, he studied Chinese for two-and-a-half years before transferring to MI6 in Geneva. But he became restless in the ascetic Swiss city and decided to return to England to attempt to launch a political career from the dole queue.A former Labour supporter, he started to move to the Right, explaining: ‘I discovered that I had never really been a socialist’.In 1976 he won the Liberal Party candidacy for Yeovil – a seemingly impregnable Tory stronghold – and worked for years to take the constituency, failing in 1979, but claiming it in 1983.He and his young family had gone through a brutally tough period. He had to make ends meet with a series of short-term jobs including working for a sheepskin coat-makers, Westland Helicopters and as a youth worker for Dorset County Council. He was also unemployed for six-months.‘Nothing I have ever done was as hard as that,’ he said once. ‘It unmanned me.’He hated the Commons at first, and struggled in the chamber, so strove to fashion the energetic everyman image instead.His brash bravado – and insistence that Labour was doomed and the Liberal Democrats would replace them – carried him through his difficult early years as leader as he tried to reshape a party described at the time as ‘confused, demoralised, starved for money and in the grip of a bitter identity crisis’.          When he took over as leader of the Social and Liberal Democrats – the Lib Dems – in July 1988, the party was on the brink of extinction, languishing at five per cent in the polls, neck-and-neck with the Greens, and earning it the soubriquet of the ‘dead parrot’ party from Margaret ThatcherThe position he took after the Tiananmen Square massacre – that Hong Kong citizens should be allowed to come to Britain – made many Liberals feel the party had recovered its soul, while the first Gulf War gave him a chance to showcase his military experience as he set up his own ‘war cabinet’ and sped between TV and radio studios.He never lived down the ‘Pantsdown’ nickname and it was painful: particularly because he had used happy family snaps on his personal election material. In one interview he claimed that it had drawn him closer to his wife, saying: ‘Most people think I am a rampant carnivore, but there is an oddly feminine quality to my character.’          In 1988, Ashdown, pictured with his wife Jane, was elected leader of the newly created Social and Liberal Democratic Party which saw a merger between the SDP and the Liberals          In his final months, Ashdown had been co-ordinating talks between politicians about creating a new centrist party to oppose Brexit After resigning the leadership in 1999, he was elevated to the peerage as Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon and spent much of the subsequent period concentrating on his interest in Bosnia. In March 2002, he testified as a witness for the prosecution at the trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal.After taking up the post of High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 2002, he was sometimes described mockingly as ‘the Viceroy of Bosnia’ by critics because of his allegedly high-handed approach to the post. He left that job in May 2006.In 2007, it was reported that Gordon Brown, then the Labour Prime Minister, had offered Ashdown the job of Northern Ireland Secretary. However, Menzies Campbell, then leader of the Lib Dems, did not want members of his party to hold office in a Labour Government.          Ashdown, pictured here with John Major and Tony Blair survived the scandal over his affair with his secretary It was widely thought he would be offered a Cabinet post in the Conservative-Lib Dem Coalition Government formed in 2010 – but again he was to be disappointed.Ashdown spent his final months playing a key behind-the-scenes role in attempting to reshape the political landscape again by holding talks with anti-Corbyn Labour MPs about a new party.          As leader of the Liberal Democrats, he had hoped for a hung parliament, so his party could hold the balance of power and change the electoral system to proportional representation to further boost his party\u0027s prospectsHe also became reflective about the personal and political forces which formed him, including the tragedies of his younger brother Richard dying when he was just 11 months old in India, his brother Robert succumbing to leukaemia when he was 14 and a sister dying in a car crash.‘Losing three children was very hard on my parents, who turned to spiritualism for comfort. Those losses affected me too, of course. I have always felt great anxiety when any of the children or grandchildren have been ill,’ he said.He had met his wife when he was 20 and she was 21. In 2014, he described her as ‘the bedrock of my existence but admitted: ‘Sometimes she has said she could have done with fewer adventures during our marriage.’Asked whether he was a good father he said: ‘I made space for my children to have their own lives, but my political ambitions swallowed a lot of the time I could have spent being with them.‘Jane gets much more of the credit for bringing up two wonderful children. I adore being a grandfather’.          He finished his military service, pictured here with the Royal Marines standing on a Land Rover in Belfast. He served in Northern Ireland between 1970 and 1972 "},{"url":null,"title":"Councils order families not recycle wrapping paper Christmas cards","story":"    Thousands of tons of recyclable paper had to be dumped last year because people had mixed it with shiny wrapping, which is covered in plastic, and glitter-covered cardsBritain will throw away 40 square miles of wrapping paper this Christmas, enough to cover Manchester. Most councils ask householders to separate glitter and metallic foil paper from their recyclable paper, but people often get this wrong.Santas of all shapes and sizes march through Crimea as...It’s official!

She said it was the trauma of being locked up for five years as an autistic teenager in an adult psychiatric unit.If you understand anything about autism and learning disabilities, then you can appreciate how this smart but troubled woman had reached this tragic point after years of forced sedation and frequent seclusion.Such people can need order, routine and control in their lives. They might struggle with sensory overload such as bright lights, loud noises and crowded places.                            Grim deeds we thought had been banished to the dark past                         If they have one type of autism, called pathological demand avoidance – traits seen in the awful case of Bethany, one of the first autistic teenagers I reported on, who was locked in seclusion and fed through a hatch – they may need coaxing rather than coercion. So when they have anxieties, it is hard to think of anything worse than confining them in chaotic places filled with troubled psychiatric patients and where staff often lack correct training.Then, when these people go to pieces, they lock them up in tiny cells and treat them like dangerous animals.Their families also suffer. Many disintegrate under the immense stress of seeing their beloved children suffer systemic abuse or forcibly sedated into zombies.There is a clear pattern. Parents seek help as children hit adolescence and become bigger. They trust experts who say it will just take a few weeks in an assessment and treatment unit. Then the teenagers and young adults are snared for years.          Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised to act after reading my reports – then pathetically ordered another limited review that does not report finally until 2020Once inside, many are frequently moved – sometimes in cages – far away.One mother told me she spends £250 and two days making each 800-mile round-trip to visit her son for two hours.Bear in mind that autism and learning disabilities are not conditions that can be cured. These are simply people with alternative needs, outlooks and perceptions who are being detained without dignity or justice.Men and women handle incarceration differently. Men can become more angry and aggressive. Women, often placed with patients who are self-harming or suffering eating disorders, start mimicking such behaviour to fit in. Such incarceration is like a spiral of cruelty.It locks innocent people in unsuitable places that intensify mental stresses, which then make it harder for them to win freedom.This is all bad enough. But it gets worse. For there is a whiff of corruption emerging from this system as rapacious private firms muscle in on the system, raking off vast profits while having the power to determine if people can escape their clutches.Multinationals, hedge funds and private equity groups are buying up psychiatric units holding these people and opening new centres – yet Ministers have repeatedly promised to empty them since the Winterbourne View abuse scandal in 2011. No wonder: they earn fees of up to £2,007 a day per patient while paying support staff scarcely more than minimum wage. So we have the sickening sight of the Priory Group owner giving £8.2 million to its sacked US boss while paying £8.50 an hour to carers.This money comes from the NHS, although it is often far cheaper, more effective and definitely more humane to provide proper community support. But this comes from cash-strapped councils, so many prefer to dump the problem on the NHS. Children’s mental health services are also badly underfunded, so some also shift problems by sectioning challenging teenagers. One such distressing case came to my attention last week when I discovered that a nine-year-old boy with autism was nearly sent to an adult secure unit recently. ‘Everyone was saying they could not cope,’ said Michael Richards, a senior social worker in Berkshire. ‘But the last resort should not have been a psychiatric hospital.’With the help of experts, tiny changes at home – such as fixing meal times and shifting the boy into his own bedroom – ensured that after three months his behaviour improved and medication stopped. ‘Small things can be very meaningful for an autistic person but there is systemic failure in many places,’ said Mr Richards.Yet, once again, for all the lofty talk of transforming care, politicians have kicked this into touch. Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised to act after reading my reports – then pathetically ordered another limited review that does not report finally until 2020.Meanwhile, MPs debated a bill last week regarding treatment of people who lack capacity to give consent that makes it easier to hold people for longer periods while doing little to stop conflicts of interest for private firms with power to deprive citizens of their liberty. There are many causes of this crisis, from incompetence and complacency through to a disturbing lack of compassion. But hidden away behind locked doors, barbarism is being inflicted on people with autism and learning disabilities.At this time of family celebration, remember these traumatised citizens and families ripped apart by the state under the guise of ‘care’. Then think of that famous saying that you measure a nation’s worth by how it treats its weakest members – and ask what this scandal tells us about 21st Century Britain?"},{"url":null,"title":"ANDREW GREEN Government caved pressure employers","story":"    Home Secretary Sajid Javid presented a new White Paper that sets out plans that will open up Britain for business while taking back much-needed control of our bordersTo be blunt, the Government has caved in to pressure from employers without regard for the interests of British workers, particularly those of our young people looking for decent careers.The fact of the matter is that migration to Britain from countries outside the EU now makes up three-quarters of the total – yet for several years now Ministers have done nothing useful to clamp down on the loopholes and abuses in the system and they show little sign of doing so in future.Those in power know very well that they are on thin ice. The sheer scale of immigration is a real and entirely legitimate concern to the public. The net annual figure peaked at a third of a million a couple of years ago. No wonder nearly two-thirds of the people of Great Britain think immigration has been too high over the past decade.They have good reason for alarm. Since 2001, immigration has been adding one million to our population every three years.They might not have the precise statistics to hand but ordinary members of the public are well aware that the roads and trains are getting ever more crowded.          Theresa May has been determined to face down the Treasury and others who say that immigration is an undiluted good for our economyMany are concerned about getting on to the housing ladder but they know that the demand arising from immigration is no help. Official housing projections show that if net migration to England were to continue at 210,000 a year, we would have to build about 90,000 homes a year – a new home every six minutes day and night.To be fair to Theresa May, she has been determined to face down the Treasury and others who say that immigration is an undiluted good for our economy and has attempted to stick to the Conservative manifesto pledge of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. Yet she has not had the Cabinet support she deserves.Take Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary and the man in charge of border controls. He refused eight times on Radio 4’s Today programme to confirm the target – only to be publicly slapped down by the Prime Minister in Parliament that very day.Hoist by their own backstop: Ireland faces being hammered...NO cap on immigration after Brexit: EU workers will STILL be...Share this articleDoes he seriously intend to reduce immigration? Do his colleagues? On the face of it, the Government White Paper seems sensible enough. The major change it proposes is that EU citizens and those from outside the EU will be treated in the same way from January 2021 when the proposed transition period (from EU membership to full Brexit) comes to an end.The route for skilled workers will be widened and there will be a new ‘temporary’ route for low-skilled workers.But the detail of these arrangements tells a very different story.One problem is this: under huge pressure from industry, the Government has thrown open the doors to ‘skilled’ workers.           With the apparent support of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, there is now talk of a threshold of £21,000And the definition of ‘skilled’ has been reduced from degree to A-Level or its equivalent – a change that will open millions of jobs in the UK to people worldwide who are looking for a better life.It gets worse. The Government is proposing that there will no longer be any need for employers to advertise posts in the UK before rushing to recruit from overseas. In other words, anybody will be free to bring in a ‘skilled’ worker, provided that they claim they will pay them £30,000 a year or more.And even that limit is under intense pressure from industry, apparently with the support of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond. There is now talk of a threshold of £21,000, which is hardly a hurdle at all, especially as it is very easy to manipulate salaries by including housing allowances and other expenses. Most worrying of all, there will be no cap on numbers. The plans get no better when it comes to low-skilled migration. It is proposed that visas will be limited to 12 months, after which the holder is supposed to return home for a one-year ‘cooling off’ period.But how the Government expects to ensure that they leave on time is anyone’s guess. What we do know is that this is a blatant attempt to fiddle immigration statistics which have long been such an embarrassment to the Government.Here is how it will work. When foreign travellers arrive at a port or airport, a sample will be asked whether they intend to stay for a year or more. If they say yes they are included as international migrants. But these people will say no and will not be included in the migration statistics. Amazingly, this route will also be uncapped.What happens if they overstay? Nothing. The Government does not have the resources to locate them, let alone remove them.Their capacity to remove immigration offenders and former prisoners is only about 9,000 a year, so the result will be that they add to the population of illegal immigrants that former senior Home Office officials have already estimated at more than a million.None of this is about controlling immigration. It is quite the opposite – it is abdicating control.It is not as if our existing EU workforce is departing in droves. In the last available year, 74,000 more EU citizens arrived than left. This is down from the peak of 190,000 a couple of years ago – a fall that may be due to uncertainty about the future, a drop in the value of the pound or a mini-boom in Poland – but there is no reason to expect a sudden exodus.In any case, low-skilled and low-paid workers, while adding to total production, do not add to productivity per head, which is what really matters. Indeed, low-paid EU workers are subsidised by the Treasury with working-age benefits to the tune of £4.7 billion a year in 2015-16 – or nearly £13 million a day. This is serious money.Meanwhile, a pool of low-wage migrants discourages employers from investing in the productivity of the existing workforce. Is this why apprenticeship training by British employers has fallen through the floor?Then there is the persistent and growing problem of non-EU migration, which is now running at 250,000 a year, the highest for 14 years. This is a huge issue that must be tackled and which now requires a very different approach. For a start, the ‘skilled’ route must not be diluted. It must remain at degree level and the numbers must be capped.There should also be a medium skilled route confined to, for example, plumbers and electricians, and limited to EU workers for a specific period of stay. We do not believe there should be any route for the unskilled aside from the occasional, very carefully controlled, scheme.There is plenty more we could and should do. We should demand higher standards of English from spouses intending to come to Britain from abroad. We should interview foreign students before they arrive to ensure they are legitimate. We should tighten up border controls that mean we can never be entirely clear who has entered or who has left the country.Meanwhile, there is a serious risk that the system now proposed could spin out of control.The public have made their concerns very clear. If the Government continues to ride roughshod over them, they will pay a very high price, and will deserve to do so. "},{"url":null,"title":"BBC drama king screenwriter claims women bosses forcing make female characters feisty","story":"    In his illustrious 50-year career, screenwriter Andrew Davies has forged a formidable reputation for creating strong female charactersIn his illustrious 50-year career, screenwriter Andrew Davies has forged a formidable reputation for creating strong female characters.But now he says he is not allowed to make his women anything but feisty – by the powerful female executives who run television.Davies, who is known for adaptations of classics such as Pride And Prejudice and War \u0026amp Peace, says bosses want to see an image of themselves projected on screen, and veto any \u0027droopy, soppy\u0027 girls he wants to pen.He said: \u0027I started writing lead characters for women who disconcerted men quite early on in my career.

I’ve spent several nights in those suites and would jump at the opportunity to spend more time with their 24-hour room service, irresistible minibars, enormous bathrooms, huge corner sofas and TV screens in every room.Given Jose’s wife wanted to remain in London, why would anyone in their right mind prefer to go home to a dark, empty house where you may have run out of Nespresso pods?Where have all the good lights gone?Our tree is always dressed with old-fashioned, coloured fairy lights but I fear this may be the last year I’ll manage it because these traditional decorations are almost impossible to find.All of the new bulbs are LED strings with the harsh, ugly light of a crime scene and the hectic flashing of an ambulance.

It was taken by the astronaut Bill Anders on Christmas Eve 1968 as the Apollo 8 spacecraft rounded the dark side of the moon for a fourth time. When Earth came up over the horizon, Anders scrabbled for his Hasselblad camera and started clicking.In that pre-digital age, five days passed. The astronauts returned to Earth the film was retrieved and developed. In its new year edition, Life magazine printed the photo on a double-page spread alongside a poem by US poet laureate James Dickey: “And behold  The blue planet steeped in its dream  Of reality, its calculated vision shaking with the only love.”This was not quite the first look at our world from space. Lunar probes had sent back crudely scanned images of a crescent Earth shrouded in cloud. A satellite had even taken a colour photo that, in the autumn of 1968, the radical entrepreneur Stewart Brand put on the cover of his first Whole Earth Catalog. The next edition, in spring 1969, used Anders’s photograph, by now known as Earthrise.Brand’s catalogue was a DIY manual for the Californian counterculture, a crowdsourced compendium of life hacks about backpacking, home weaving, tantra art and goat husbandry. Its one-world, eco ethos was a weird offshoot of the macho tech of the space age – those hunks of aluminium run on rocket fuel and cold war rivalries. But then looking back at Earth was itself a weird offshoot of the moon missions. It just happened that Apollo 8’s aim – to locate the best lunar landing sites – needed high-res photography, which was also good for taking pictures of planets a quarter of a million miles away.Brand was one of a group of environmental activists who felt that an image of “Spaceship Earth” would bring us all together in watchfulness and care for our planetary craft and its precious payload. “Earthrise”, though, did more than just corroborate this gathering mood. With its incontestable beauty, a beauty that had needed no eye of a beholder for billions of years, it caught the human heart by surprise.The Earth pictured in Earthrise looks unlike traditional cartographic globes that mark out land and sea along lines of latitude and longitude. Slightly more than half the planet is illuminated. The line iding night and day severs Africa. Earth looks as if it is floating alone in the eternal night of space, each part awaiting its share of the life-giving light of the sun.Apart from a small brown patch of equatorial Africa, the planet is blue and white. At first glance it seems to have the sheen of blue-veined marble. But look closer and that spherical perfection softens a little. Earth ulges its true state as oceanic and atmospheric, warmly welcoming and achingly vulnerable.The blue is light scattered by the sea and sky. The white is the gaseous veneer that coats our planet and lets us live. You can just make out the “beautiful blue halo”, with its gentle shift from tender blue to purple black, that Yuri Gagarin noticed on his first low-orbit flight. That halo is our fragile biosphere, and is all that stands between us and the suffocating void.Fifty years ago the biochemist James Lovelock was working for Nasa and developing a theory of Earth as a single, self-regulating superorganism. It had reached a homeostatic state conducive to life, he believed, against odds as long as “surviving unscathed a drive blindfold through rush-hour traffic”. Lovelock’s theory, later named Gaia after the Greek goddess of the Earth, makes a special kind of sense when you gaze at our planet from the moon.The poet Archibald MacLeish caught it best for a piece in the New York Times on Christmas Day 1968 – oddly, when only the Apollo 8 crew had seen Earthrise. All MacLeish had to go on was the live television broadcast by the astronauts on 23 December, when Jim Lovell had pointed his camera out of the cabin window and captured a coarse monochrome image of Earth from 175,000 miles away. “To see the Earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats,” MacLeish wrote, “is to see ourselves as riders on the Earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold.”MacLeish had jumped the gun by a few days other writers had anticipated this sight centuries earlier. In his fantastical narrative The Man in the Moon (1638), the author and ine Francis Godwin has his hero fly to the moon in a machine harnessed to a flock of wild swans. As he ascends into space, the world’s landmasses diminish, not just in size but in significance – Africa is “like unto a pear that had a morsel bitten out upon one side of him” – while the ocean seems “like a great shining brightness” and the whole Earth “masks itself with a kind of brightness like another moon”. Godwin grasped that from space Earth would look terraqueous, and far more aqua than terra.In Jules Verne’s Around the Moon (1870), three adventurers, fired to the moon by a giant space gun, look back at Earth and see “its delicate crescent suspended in the deep blackness of the sky” and “its light, rendered blueish by the thickness of its atmosphere”. When the narrator of HG Wells’s The First Men in the Moon (1901) sees Earth from a spaceship, its three-dimensionality starkly reveals itself in the dance of sunlight and shadow on its surface. “The land below us was twilight and vague,” he writes, “but westward the vast grey stretches of the Atlantic shone like molten silver.” These early sci-fi writers guessed correctly that, from space, a world made of water and air would shimmer as if it were alive. They saw Earthrise before the astronauts did.Fanciful space flights, full of backward glances at our world, occur in very ancient texts. The lesson is always the same: don’t imagine you matter. The vastness of the world, which renders your own life so little, is itself a speck of dust adrift in the vast cathedral of space. Cicero’s Republic imagines the dead Roman general Scipio Africanus, hero of the second Punic war, appearing to his grandson, Scipio Aemilianus, in a dream. The younger Scipio finds himself in the heavens gazing down on Carthage, which he will later destroy in the third Punic war. The world has shrunk to the point where he is “scornful of our empire, which covers only a single point upon its surface”.“O how ridiculous are the boundaries of mortals!” wrote Seneca, imagining Earth from the same cosmic perspective. A fable by the second-century satirist Lucian of Samosata tells of a “sky-man” who flies to the moon. Looking back at Earth, he sees “how little there was for our friends the rich to be proud of … The widest-acred of them all had not a single Epicurean atom under cultivation.”The ancients knew how minuscule our preoccupations would seem from afar. The whole earthers of the 1960s thought that photographic proof might help us to see this obvious truth in new ways. Border disputes, imperial wars, the enslavement of other peoples, the spoiling of the planet for selfish and ephemeral gain: all would be exposed as what the cosmologist Carl Sagan called “the squabbles of mites on a plum”.And yet, to a mite, that plum is everything. The power of Earthrise as an image derived partly from its being a picture of the plum taken by a mite – one of the first three to escape the plum’s gravity. With the brown-grey desert of the moon as contrast, the Earth shone as if alert to its singularity. As Marina Benjamin writes in her book Rocket Dreams (2003), this made it “difficult not to imbue the planet with exemplariness”.Earthrise was edited for anthropocentric ends. The Apollo 8 crew saw Earth to the side of the moon, not above it, and to them it seemed tiny. Anders compared it to being “in a darkened room with only one visible object, a small blue-green sphere about the size of a Christmas-tree ornament”. Nasa flipped the photo so that Earth seemed to be rising above the moon’s horizon, and then cropped it to make Earth look bigger and more focal. Earthrise was an Earth selfie, taken by earthlings.Since 1968 the earthlings have had many visual reminders of their cosmic irrelevance. Their home planet has been demoted to what Sagan called the “pale blue dot”, the tiny fleck of Earth, no bigger than a pixel, in a photo of our galaxy taken in 1990 by the Voyager 1 probe from 3.7bn miles away.But we prefer to ignore the evidence. In our daily lives we are all flat earthers. We carry on thinking that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Nor is our stewardship of the planet any less culpably forgetful. We still squabble over the juiciest bits of the plum we still fight and die over its pinprick empires the rich and powerful seem more ludicrously puffed-up than ever.Did the 22-year-old Donald Trump, when he first saw Earthrise, feel awed and humbled by human smallness? I’m guessing no. Our species is just as venal and measly-minded as it was half a century ago. Perhaps more so, now that the technology that excites us is not the rocket blasting us into deep space, but the computer coding that blasts us through a wormhole into cyberspace: a human-built universe composed of our own self-admiring obsessions, exhilarating and exhausting enough to fill a lifetime.Still, Earthrise must have changed something. What’s seen can’t be unseen. Perhaps it flits across your mind when you open Google Earth and see that familiar virtual globe gently spinning. Just before you click and drag to fly yourself to some portion of the world no bigger than an allotment, you may briefly take in, with a little stomach lurch, that this slowly revolving sphere holds close to 8 billion people, living out lives as small and short and yet meaningful as the universe is infinite and eternal and yet meaningless. On that gigantic, glistening marble, mottled with blue-white swirls, lies everyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6a082b79215f8313c3692faf066c183460f63b/66_461_5720_3433/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=284ce619486d05a52d395870839418a7","title":"buy your own guardian classic photograph cumbrian shepherd 1990","story":"This week in our regular series of exclusive  print sales is a shepherd with his flock in Cumbria, by  photographer Denis Thorpe photographer Denis Thorpe was on a whirlwind tour of Cumbria in November 1990, documenting the activities of rural communities with the then Countryside Commission, when he chanced upon a pair of shepherds bringing their sheep down from the hills – a ritual known as “the gather”, says Thorpe. “I was lucky to be there at the moment they came through the gate – I felt I’d captured the animals’ breath in the cold air.” It was a beautiful composition, he says: the shepherd with his stick, the dry stone wall, the sheep. “It couldn’t be anywhere but the north of England.” Hannah BoothBuy your exclusive print herePrintsPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.

Beyoncé for the first week, Mariah for the second, Celine Dion for the third, and then full GC for the fourth.”Collins, who made her name on The Only Way Is Essex, is about to complete whatever the Emmy-Grammy-Oscar-Tony equivalent of reality shows is, having appeared on just about all of them, even that one where celebrities had to learn to e that was about as exciting as watching people learn how to e.I only regret that she never managed to do The Jump, for which I had a soft spot – it got famous people to compete in winter sports, only to find that such activities required a touch more expertise than expected, as 34 of its 60 competitors were injured. It upped the stakes of celebrity reality TV eating a bull’s penis in the jungle no longer seemed so horrific next to the very probable prospect of snapping a ligament in a snowsuit while attempting to jump in the air. Oddly enough, it was axed after four series, so Dancing on Ice, in which celebrities can spend weeks avoiding a broken ankle and trying to pretend they’re not wishing they’d done Strictly instead, will have to do.Collins is such excellent value that it’s little wonder they finally signed her up. She is a walking headline generator and guaranteed entertainment. She made Celebrity MasterChef a talking point by getting someone else to do the cooking for her. She turned her series of Celebrity Big Brother into a timeless content farm for makers of memes (or, in Collins speak, “memés”). She is clearly self-aware, but seems to lack self-awareness entirely, too, and there is something infectious about her absolute over-the-top confidence.“Opening night, I want to do the splits. I want to do a couple of spins, I want to do fireworks,” she says in the promo video, before stumbling around like Bambi on the Baileys. Fellow contestant Brian McFadden has revealed that Collins has been blocked from their WhatsApp group twice for rudeness, but when you’ve got a personality this size, what emojis could possibly contain you? “I’ve asked for grade A Swarovski crystals and as many feathers as they can find,” she has said. Princess, crown, clinking champagne glasses.There were few comedies darker than Sacha Baron Cohen’s Who Is America?, in which the comedian prostheticised – OK, not a word, unless we’re playing Scrabble and it’s my go – himself into a series of increasingly absurd and provocative characters.He did this either to take advantage of his victims’ openness and goodwill or to expose the hypocrisy of people in power who happily condone things such as arming children, depending on which side you took. I found it too bleak to enjoy and often watched with a wince. It made Chris Morris tricking celebrities into campaigning against the fake drug “cake” look like a fuzzy warm remnant of spoofs gone by.In an excellent interview with Deadline, Baron Cohen revealed that he would be unable to make another series for at least 10 years, because his cover was blown. “We relied on the fact that no one was expecting me. I hadn’t done anything undercover for over a decade and so nobody thought, ‘Wait a minute, is this a Sacha Baron Cohen character?’ That’s the problem,” he explains.He also reveals what happened when he tricked Sarah Palin into an interview. Palin, you might remember, wrote a lengthy Facebook post before the show aired, denouncing his sense of humour as “evil, exploitative, sick” and calling him “shallow Sacha boy”, all but guaranteeing publicity for the series. It was, it turns out, entirely in vain. “She was just delivering these kind of rote answers, as if she was doing a campaign speech,” he said. “Even though I sat with her I think for about two-and-a-half hours, there was no comedy gold.” She never even appeared on the show.Danny Dyer is continuing his inevitable bid for an official role in the future of this nation by going up against the Queen to deliver the Alternative Christmas Message on Channel 4.He is, after all, of royal descent, so it seems only fitting that he rises to the challenge of talking some fackin sense. Over the crumbs of a festive feast, he will deliver a short speech in which he reflects on the political year gone by, an annus horribilis on which few will be able to look back with undiluted pleasure.Dyer is a strong choice for this ceremonial role. He voted Leave, but has changed his mind since, famously calling David Cameron a “twat”, twice, live on television, as Piers Morgan snivelled: “I think you’re referring to our former prime minister.” Dyer will discuss the importance of having someone to look up to, like his mentor, Harold Pinter, and will return to politics on Christmas Day, labelling Donald Trump an “absolute melt”, while showering disdain on our own politicians. “That shambles down in Westminster, what a palaver that is. I mean where are our leaders? Where are they?” At this point of the year, that’s looking like insightful political analysis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb960a3307b1ab6007165d4b7ce663a9bbef228/0_202_4069_2442/master/4069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca8f49e9f2d139ab3fe9e139b61e878a","title":"labour leadership is at rock bottom wont be forgiven for conniving in rightwing brexit","story":"The Labour party is united: the vast majority of its MPs, its members and its voters – from all classes – want Britain to stay in the European Union.

It is the European answer to the 21st-century question of how to manage interdependencies between countries – economic, trading, security, financial, scientific – in a world where necessarily they must grow.Those who believe in it as a force for good do not want to go down without a struggle – to wimp out because to have another democratic encounter with the issue is said to be anti-democratic, arousing dark warnings of impending civic unrest from those asked to vote again. A one-off, never to be revisited referendum, as in totalitarian states in the 1930s, has become an irreversible building block for a rightwing world, with the connivance of parts of the old left that hold the same conception of imagined, untrammelled national autonomy as the extreme right.This brutal right, with its increasingly strident nationalist and racist overtones, is not going to go away after Brexit – it will raise the stakes still further, attempting to turn our beloved country into a venomous, intolerant cesspit. It has to be confronted sooner or later. Better sooner.Yet Labour’s leadership refuses to speak for this powerful and growing conviction within its party – in the country, too, with opinion polls hardening in favour of EU membership. As the government amazingly puts the country on to a war footing to manage the fallout of an impending hard Brexit, Labour’s voice is weak and temporising. In his interview with the  Jeremy Corbyn says that even if Labour won a snap general election, it would lead the country out of the EU but with a “better deal” built around a permanent customs union. Ongoing EU membership threatens a socialist programme, he argues, because of state-aid rules. If Theresa May recasts her deal in softer terms, he will back it, he says.His stance is wrong at every level. First, he has just reduced his electoral base to the shrinking Leave vote so that Labour will not and cannot win a general election. Remain voters, now the majority, must find another home. Worse, he is threatening the cohesion of his party by opposing its majority view and the values that support it, just as Brexit is threatening the cohesion of the Conservative party.All members of the Labour party must now examine their conscience: is this what they stand for and believe? The Corbyn deal, which can only be incrementally different from the May deal, will suffer from all the same deficiencies. We are to be associated with our continent as a satellite but not to share in its governance or play a part in shaping its destiny.It betrays a 19th-century view of socialism. What industries are going to be built by direct government subventions? The world of the future is not state-supported steel and cement companies. Britain has the third largest AI industry and could become the global hub for blockchain – all done inside the EU. The task for 21st-century socialism is not to bankroll directly such vigorous businesses. It is to build the architecture to generate more of them, enfranchise workforces, protect the backs of ordinary men and women, put environmental sustainability at the heart of our economy and continually to upgrade the social contract. In this, the EU is our ally, not our foe.The case must be put to the people again, framed by what we now know. It must be allied to a passionate case for reform. The desperate poverty and extraordinary inequalities that disfigure our country and that properly persuaded millions they could not vote for the status quo have to be addressed. Our economy has to be reshaped by an imaginative state our society recast our political institutions reformed.On top, we need two reciprocal commitments from Europe. Freedom of movement is a core freedom, but host societies must have the capacity to regulate inflows of people, otherwise intolerable strains are created. The multiple derogations from freedom of movement used by other EU states must be codified into a new deal that permits Britain, and of course other members, sufficient control of our borders.Second, the EU itself needs a democratic and accountability reboot. We are not recommitting to the same old EU – but one committed to change.This case would best be made by Labour as the centre of a cross-party coalition: it has credibility as a fighter against poverty and abusive capitalism and an advocate for internationalism. But the case for tolerance and openness cannot be made from a tribal silo. I admire Tories such as Phillip Lee, Jo Johnson and Sam Gyimah who have resigned on this issue, and others such as Anna Soubry, Justine Greening, Sarah Wollaston, Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve. I would be proud to stand and campaign alongside them – and also Nicola Sturgeon, Caroline Lucas and Vince Cable. Any differences are secondary to what unites us. What does our country stand for, what is its future and who are our allies? Not Putin, Xi and Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be6a22a6e786a9184c5ac8a36c348e0b836beaba/0_0_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e0e5f5496f5a0647db5946c689dc458","title":"observer letters no second brexit vote is an affront to democracy","story":"Freezing democracy by preventing a further vote is undemocratic (“Chaos reigns. The only viable option left is a second vote”, Editorial). Intrinsic to democracy is regular consultation of the people.You might argue that after an overwhelming majority vote it would be unnecessary to have any further votes on a topic for some time however, the reverse logic equally applies.A small majority indicates that the electorate is seriously ided and, as events and people move on, that majority opinion could easily shift. Given that the terms of the EU withdrawal agreement were unknown at the time of voting, that the Leave vote was not overwhelming, that two countries in the UK voted to remain and that the UK faces some of the most important series of decisions in its recent history, exercising further democracy can only be just.It is quite ridiculous to suggest that calling for a vote is against democracy. Voting is what democracy is all about and it should not exclude the option to change direction completely.Paul YoungWeybridge, SurreyToby Helm reports that Labour activists believe Brexit will prevent the implementation of a leftwing manifesto and therefore support a second referendum (“Party activists pile pressure on Corbyn to back second vote”, News).They are opposed by party chair, Ian Lavery. Mr Lavery believes that Labour support for a second referendum would lead to “a huge loss of traditional voters” and to Labour losing the next general election. Has he not considered, first, that many “non-traditional” voters would swing the other way in gratitude to Labour if their support for a referendum saved us from a no-deal Brexit and second, that after such a disaster the general election would not be worth winning? John FilbyAshover, DerbyshireAndrew Rawnsley (“Failed by both its major parties…”, Comment) is right to dismiss the notion of a “managed no deal” as a euphemism. The same euphemism has been applied to the “managed migration” of claimants from existing social security benefits to universal credit.Although “managed” implies that the state manages the process on behalf of claimants, claimants’ existing benefits will be stopped and all the risks associated with migration to universal credit borne by them, despite the criticisms of the social security advisory committee and a number of parliamentary committees. Some of the most marginalised members of our society will be hurt hardest and the same is true of a “managed no deal”.Baroness Lister of BurtersettLondon SW1I read Kenan Malik’s assertion (“We could all do with being a little less sure of ourselves”, Comment) with interest. I too watched the febrile exchange between Jenni Russell and Alastair Campbell and the viewer was indeed subjected to Campbell’s impassioned, but rather rude, interjections. In contrast, I watched a 1997 Question Time when Edward Heath was pitched against Tony Benn and there was polite, good-humoured discourse. It was just before that famous general election, so the temperature must have been running high. Like the writer, I am probably just as guilty with my fierce rants the Brexit debacle has brought out the worst, intolerant behaviour in many of us and that is a shame, but it shows how isive it has become.Judith A DanielsGreat Yarmouth, NorfolkDavid Olusoga wrote that he should not be maligned for expressing his opinion that the Benin bronzes should be transferred from the British Museum to Nigeria (“I’m a trustee of English Heritage…”, Comment).He is right. It is also worth noting the legal rules that, then as now, sought to limit the pillaging of towns and cities and the confiscation of works of art. Today, this is clearly proscribed by international conventions, but even in the 19th century it was frowned upon. A custom of international law had been developing since the early 19th century, whereby works of art remained beyond the reach of invading armies.Unfortunately, this custom only applied between the states of Europe and not to Africa. So, while the pillaging of Benin city by British troops in 1897 was not, strictly speaking, contrary to international law, it was far from consistent with approved practice in Europe. This does not affect the legal grounds for keeping the pieces in Britain, but has a bearing on the moral argument.Alexander HermanAssistant directorInstitute of Art and LawPentre Moel, Builth Wells, PowysNick Cohen identifies the Bolsheviks as the inventors of “disaster socialism” (“Why are Labour’s leaders so quiet on Europe?”, Comment). However, the Bolsheviks did not “yearn” for defeat in the First World War and Trotsky offered “neither war nor peace” at Brest-Litovsk.The Bolsheviks thought their refusal to prolong the Russian war effort would encourage the working classes of Europe to rise up against their oppressors and extend the revolution. They did not want defeat, but gambled, hoping that their vision of a new world would be realised. They were betrayed by the Central Powers and overestimated the revolutionary desires in western Europe, but this was no cynical attempt to destroy Russia and benefit from a ruined society. Joe StreetNewcastle upon TyneI have some sympathy for Rebecca Nicholson in her annoyance at the choice of a Yorkshire accent for a working-class Valjean in a new Les Misérables (“Dominic West: is his the authentic voice of a working-class hero?”, Comment).My sympathy, however, is limited by the large troupe of professional “northerners” who confuse YorkshireLancashire with an exclusive claim on working-class culture. As a “soft southerner”, I was confused at the middle-class gentility I saw when I first visited such bastions of working-class culture as Harrogate and I was eating pies made in my mum’s Gloucester kitchen long before I discovered that they were a Yorkshire delicacy.I watched Dennis Potter plays about working-class people with Gloucestershire accents. Where did he find these mythical characters? So it was with great relief that I read Rebecca Nicholson’s article. I hope more northerners join her campaign to rescue the north from this proletarianisation of their culture.Colin MannStroud, GloucestershireThank you for the advice on storage of cheese and how to use up leftover pieces (“Why two million kilos of Christmas cheese end up in the bin,” News).We shall be buying a variety of cheeses this week, as we do every week. Perhaps this is a measure of how we have assimilated into life in France. We have learned a number of things: buy lots of cheese every week, especially local ones eat cheese at least once a day, and definitely before pudding and finally, know exactly what is in your fridge and consume accordingly.We find that a fine cheese such as chaource is never as delicious after the first incision, while roquefort, the king of cheeses, remains its piquant, unctuous self until the very last crumb.

The most important one is the law of cause and effect. This is my favourite law of nature because it leaves no room for excuses and fannying about. Every effect has a specific and identifiable cause and every cause or action has a specific and predictable effect. Thus, in the universe occupied by the Scottish Tories, there are times when these laws must be artificially distorted or suspended outright. This usually happens when their shadowy realm clashes with the real world.We saw an entertaining example of this just the other week when some of those Tories who occupy the scarecrow wing of the party thought it might be a good idea to visit their local food banks. They proceeded to have photos taken among the tinned comestibles before posting them on social media with jaunty (and identical) messages. That the existence of food banks might have been caused by their party’s austerity policies and latterly by its imposition of universal credit appeared not to have concerned them a jot.Recent instances could be observed in the responses of Scotland’s two top Tories, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell, to Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Having previously said they couldn’t back anything that undermined Northern Ireland’s union with the UK they have become cheerleaders for a deal that does just that. The Scottish Tories and the real world display the same level of compatibility as two ferrets in a sack.In Scotland, we were treated to another classic of this Tory subgenre. It was provided by Brian Whittle, the MSP for South Scotland who found a place among the Tory listed candidates for this region despite losing the general election by almost 13,000 votes. Whittle is an amiable and well-intentioned chiel who seems to have wandered into the Scottish Conservatives by accident as a result of having too much time on his hands. Somewhere along the way, he too seems to have lost his bearings in relation to the real world.In an interview in the current issue of Holyrood magazine he was questioned about “the rape clause”, also known as the two-child benefit cap. This is the policy that seeks to restrict child tax credit and universal credit to two children except when a mother can prove that another was “conceived without her consent”. Whittle was obviously paying attention in his Tory induction seminars about how to spin reality into a fairytale. He said: “Well, number one, again, this is where politics is appalling there is no such thing as a rape clause. That’s an invention. There’s an exemption clause.” And he added: “The term ‘rape clause’ is an invention to beat the Tories with. It’s the invention of another political party.” As a father-of-three, he rejected any notion of a third child being undervalued.“But you have a good job,” the interviewer gently pointed out.Whittle is a former Olympic athlete, competing in Seoul in 1988. In 1986, he helped Britain to gold in the 4x400m relay at the European championships at Stuttgart. He excelled by running minus one of his shoes, which had flown off at his changeover – “the quickest sock in history”, was how the BBC’s David Coleman described it. By applying his political thought processes to coaching, perhaps Whittle ought to be telling young athletes to consider ditching a running shoe in the future. “After all, it worked for me.”Indeed, I would commend Whittle’s refreshingly rudimentary approach to explaining away evils to Tory strategists. As Brexit approaches, we will hear scary warnings about the four horsemen of the apocalypse thundering down the road. Riots in the streets occasioning the deployment of 3,500 army reservists: this will be spontaneous outbreaks of good cheer at gaining our independence. The troops will simply be there as genial participants.Homelessness: why, this is also an invention by vile anti-Tory forces. A spell on the streets would be good for everyone and toughen up the chaps for the inevitable military adventures that lie ahead.Shortages of medicine: why always with the negative vibes? We have become too dependent on antibiotics. A short, sharp spell without them will strengthen our collective immune system.Food shortages: this is just another chorus from the Project Fear songbook. As a nation, we throw away too much food and have an obesity crisis. I’d propose that we get the troops to stop homeless people slouching in their doorways and march them down to the local park to do some of that Falun Gong. In no time at all they’ll be jogging out to the local Tesco where executives have kindly agreed to provide them with yesterday’s unsold fruit and vegetables.From 29 March 2019, the Tories will spin a different reality to that of most other people. The royal family, hand-picked religious leaders, rightwing press barons and handily placed BBC news managers will create a parallel universe of peace, happiness and good cheer.Whenever Britain is faced with an existing or impending crisis in any sector it moves quickly to appoint a tsar. This conveys the message that “we’re all over this”. The tsar is usually a well-behaved and cheery type from business, entertainment or sport who can be trusted not to ask too many questions and quickly disappear. I’d nominate Brian Whittle as tsar for pulling ourselves together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928b03a54a183caa717e0a47ee713158210da102/0_77_2648_1588/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a829d59ee4271bc741e7f3fb6be10bd5","title":"on the real watership down rabbits are hard to come by","story":"Numbers may be at an all time low as a new adaptation of the novel hits our TV screensThe real Watership Down is not hard to find.In the introduction to his book, Richard Adams helpfully gives the Ordnance Survey map reference – sheet 174. Once located on paper, long-remembered names jump from the map: Nuthanger Farm, Ashley Warren and Honeycomb are all there. It was the multitude of rabbits found on this little square of England that inspired Adams to write Watership Down.The book, and the 1978 film that followed, famously terrified a generation. Instead of fluffy bunnies living in a rural idyll, Adams’s rabbits were both calculated killers and senselessly slaughtered. It was red in tooth and claw, and in the case of the film, shown in glorious and brutal Technicolor.But with a new BBCNetflix adaptation apparently taking a gentler tone, what is the reality for the UK’s rabbit population?For Dr Diana Bell, a rabbit disease expert at the University of East Anglia, it’s pretty dire. “Rabbits may be at an all time low” she says. “When did you last see a roadkill rabbit? You don’t anymore – they simply aren’t around like they used to be”On Watership Down itself, rabbits are certainly hard to come by. The Warren, a deep combe set into the Down, is pockmarked with burrows, but an hour’s watching reveals just four rabbits.Although there are fewer rabbits, the landscape does bear marks of the book. The huge beech tree that sheltered the Watership Down warren was a landmark for many years. “People used to really care about that tree,” says local resident Bryan. “One lady even made her husband drive three hours from Cheshire in the great storm of 1987 just to check it was all right”.The tree finally blew down in 2004, and a newly planted sapling stands in its place – ironically, fenced to protect it from rabbit damage. The names of two of Adams’s rabbit creations, Fiver and Hazel, are scratched into the fencing, the most bucolic of graffiti.Locals out on the hill have started to notice the lack of rabbits too.“Numbers have definitely gone down over the 18 years I’ve been here,” Bryan says, “I think some of that is environmental, but we still see a fair few rabbits with myxie which seems to come and go”Myxomatosis, or myxie, is a disease every bit as horrific as anything in Adams’s book, and it almost wiped out the UK’s rabbit population in the 1950s. The population bounced back, but new strains still affect the rabbits from time to time.For Bell, a newer, silent killer is even more worrying. “Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) first arrived here from China in the early 90s” she says, “and our rabbits were just starting to recover when a new strain appeared in 2010, RHDV2, which has been causing havoc ever since.”The big problem is that while myxomatosis has very obvious symptoms, RHDV2 leaves very little trace.“Rabbits that die from RHDV2 tend to look absolutely fine, so no one reports them” explains Bell, “and one key final stage of the disease is lethargy – so many simply crawl into their burrows and die underground”.As rabbits are subterranean and mostly nocturnal, it is difficult to get a good estimate of their numbers. However, when myxomatosis ravaged the population in the 1950s, buzzards, foxes and stoats all declined along with their main food source, so it is clear a decline in rabbit numbers has effects right up the food chain.But the same is also true down the food chain, and the distinctive chalk grassland of Watership Down relies on the rabbits to keep it maintained.Without the rabbits keeping the grasses down, the landscape so memorably brought to life by Adams might cease to exist too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5df25cfeaac837c14ee3290bfcf7010f95ef844/0_122_2592_2591/master/2592.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48dd3710321d18f1631ccc17de9f80e3 1010w","title":"tell us what was your favourite film of 2018","story":"As we reveal our number one film, we want to hear what you’ve been watching on the big screen and why it was memorable After counting down the 50 best films of the year,  critics voted for Roma, Alfonso Cuarón’s memoir of growing up in early 70s Mexico City film, as their standout of 2018 – a “great piece of storytelling with inspired and surreal setpieces and electrifying sequences”.But a list of 50, even separate ones for the US and the UK, will inevitably miss out some of the films you consider worthy of a place this year.So tell us, what have we missed?Tell us about your favourite film of 2018 and why you are voting for it in the form below, including the moment or plot point you think was most memorable.

Freezing spring temperatures in parts of the country, followed by the summer drought – the worst since 1976 – have hit growers across the country and threatened to put some out of business altogether.Now, however, comes a rare piece of good news for the industry. Tesco is relaxing its stringent guidelines governing the size and shape of potatoes to ensure a decent supply over Christmas. The supermarket giant has already taken delivery of some 4,000 tonnes of spuds that it would normally reject.“We’ve worked with our potato growers to use as much of the crop and prevent perfectly good spuds from going to waste,” said Rob Hooper, Tesco’s potato expert. “We want to support our growers wherever we can – and although some potatoes might be smaller and larger, they still pack the same great taste our customers expect.”More than a third of farmed fruit and vegetables never reaches supermarket shelves because it is misshapen or the wrong size, according to research published in August by the University of Edinburgh. It found that more than 50 million tonnes of produce grown across Europe is discarded each year.Supermarkets including Morrisons and Waitrose were last week reported to have increased their efforts to reduce the national food waste mountain at Christmas by offering shoppers edible produce nearing the end of its shelf life, as well as “wonky” sprouts, carrots and parsnips.The Observer reported in April that farmers were having to delay sowing their potato seeds because of the late spring snow, and that difficult weather conditons had pushed the harvesting of the nation’s asparagus back weeks. Then a sustained heatwave played further havoc with growing conditions, compounding problems for potato farmers.The shortage became so dire in the late summer that the major supermarkets had to import tonnes of potatoes from other European countries.“The extreme cold of the Beast from the East delayed planting in the spring, then the extended heat and drought of the summer impacted on crop growth and development,” said Sharon Affleck, sales and marketing director at Branston, one of the UK’s largest potato packers, which handles about 350,000 tonnes a year.“Potatoes need a good water supply to help them to grow evenly and bulk up, especially when it’s hot. This means that the fresh potatoes available to pack are generally smaller, and the shape and skin finish is not as smooth as consumers may be used to.”The widening of the specifications, which will remain in place until June when the first of the new season’s crop comes in, has been welcomed by farmers.“It continues to be critically important that retailers provide flexibility on specifications during difficult growing seasons in order for British farmers to do what they do best – producing food for the nation,” said the NFU’s chief horticulture adviser Lee Abbey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7faac616af190f468e83a2f6eb973bdd6dd2957a/0_2212_4862_2915/master/4862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60e96a8a4ba2e1101382c6977aec8902","title":"nigel slater christmas tipples and nibbles recipes","story":"Tasty crispbreads and mini muffins to soak up your festive drinksDrinking is different at Christmas. A little more plentiful, yes, but also a tad sweeter. In our house, bottles come out at this time of year that would normally never see the light of day.For every drink I pour, there has to be something to eat. It is a rule, a way of life. Thin slices of jamón ibérico with a tiny glass of sherry, some curls of gravlax with frivolous bubbles, and maybe something along the lines of a punch with plump, parmesan-crusted muffins.There will be warming drinks. Mulled wine is a much misunderstood drink, being used primarily to get everyone pissed, when it deserves a little more reverence and thought. It needs more than a couple of star anise and a cinnamon stick. Such drinks allow – some might say beg for – slightly more delicious accompaniments than they get. A fat slice of gravlax on a square of dark rye perhaps, cured with beetroot juice and juniper berries, or perhaps a tiny pastry parcel of mashed pumpkin.I baked a new batch of crispbreads this week, the texture of pebbledash, knobbly with pumpkin seeds and oats, and used them as a base for a coarse paté of grated beetroot and smoked mackerel. We ate them with glasses of prosecco turned rose pink by the addition of pomegranate juice. There were chubby little muffins, too, studded with pine kernels and rosemary and passed round with glasses of hot cider. A practice run for Boxing Day morning.All that remains now is for me to raise a glass and say thank you for another year and to wish you all a very happy Christmas.We served this with prosecco and pomegranate juice. For 12 glasses, you need a couple of bottles of prosecco, chilled for several hours, and 250ml of pomegranate juice which is about three medium-sized juicy pomegranates. Cut the fruit in half and use a lemon reamer to extract the juice. It’s a messy job, best done over a bowl wearing an apron. Divide the juice between the glasses, then top up with prosecco and serve immediately, before the fizz dies. The crackers, on the other hand, will keep for several days in an airtight tin.Enough for 12 people with drinksFor the crispbreads:plain flour 75grolled oats 20gsea salt 5gsesame seeds 60gpumpkin seeds 60gsunflower seeds 50ggroundnut or vegetable oil 50mlFor the beetroot and mackerel:smoked mackerel fillets 350gdill 20gcrème fraîche 3 heaped tbspraw beetroot 80gSet the oven at 150Cgas mark 2. Line a baking sheet, measuring approximately 40cm x 28cm, with baking parchment. Put the plain flour in a mixing bowl, then add the rolled oats, 5g of sea salt, the sesame, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then stir in the groundnut oil. Bring the ingredients together with your hands to form a ball of seed-freckled dough, then transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet.Press the dough with a floured hand to fill the baking sheet. The dough should be very thin. Bake for an hour until crisp, then remove from the oven. Transfer, still on its parchment, to a cooling rack. When cold, break into crackers and store in an airtight tin till needed.To make the mackerel and beetroot paste, discard the skin from the mackerel, then crush the flesh with a fork, checking for any stray bones.Remove the dill fronds from their stalks. Chop the fronds and add to the mackerel together with the crème fraîche. Coarsely grate the beetroot and fold gently and briefly into the mackerel. (If you over-mix, you will end up with a bright pink paste.) Cover and refrigerate until needed.To serve, place mounds of the mackerel and beetroot mixture on to pieces of cracker. You will need approximately 2 tbsp per person.If you don’t mind a bit of last-minute cooking, may I suggest you serve these warm? Light, cheesy, rosemary-scented little cakes, they are infinitely more delicious when served from the oven, like their sweet cousin, the madeleine. You could bake them an hour before you plan to eat, keeping them warm in the switched-off oven or, should the oven be busy, wrapped loosely in tin foil still in their baking tin. Ideally, though, they are meant as breakfast muffins, something to serve on Boxing Day morning.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Line 12 bun tins with paper muffin cases. Put the flour in a mixing bowl and combine thoroughly with the caster sugar, baking powder and a pinch of salt. Grate the apple without peeling it. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs then stir in the yogurt. Tear the speck into small, stamp-sized pieces and add to the batter, followed by the grated apple. Fold in the grated cheese, then lightly mix with the dry ingredients.Divide the batter between the muffin cases, add the pine nuts, rosemary and parmesan, then bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until risen and pale gold.Enough for 6cider 2 litrescinnamon sticks 2 star anise 4cloves 6sloe gin 400mlPour the cider into a large, non-reactive pan, add the cinnamon, star anise and cloves and set over a moderate heat.

Jürgen Klopp and his players can now enter the festive period four points clear of the defending champions at the top of the Premier League. While one point separated the frontrunners City could look forward to rectifying the situation when Liverpool come here in the new year now there might be little they can do if their unbeaten rivals maintain their impressive run of results.City were unrecognisable for large parts of the game and not just because key players were injured or rested. They were unimaginative going forward and sloppy in defence, with Kyle Walker having a game he will want to forget. That is to take nothing away from Crystal Palace, who were organised and effective at both ends and thoroughly deserving of three important points.“When we score three goals away from home I think we can say we deserved it,” the Palace captain Luka Milivojevic said. “Andros Townsend’s goal was amazing.”City’s captain, Fabian Delph, accepted his side had not been at their best. “Palace were stubborn and organised but we started too slowly,” he said. “The ball was not zipping about.”That was certainly true, for the shock of the season took a while to get going, even if a late City goal ensured a dramatic finale. The first half-hour was a test of patience. Palace were content to keep men back, challenging the home side to find a way through, while City’s efforts to make their wealth of possession count were hampered by their being without the spark of ingenuity that David Silva or Kevin De Bruyne would normally supply.It was one of those tepid encounters that needed a goal, though after City finally supplied one after 27 minutes the script took a wholly unexpected twist. Not only did Palace hit back almost straight away, within nine minutes of going behind they were in the lead after Andros Townsend beat Ederson with a delightful left-foot volley from 20 yards out.First things first though. City would not have seen any of that coming when Ilkay Gündoğan strode through a static defence to reach Delph’s cross and beat Vicente Guaita with a firm header. The midfielder ended up unopposed on the six-yard line but had remained onside – the Palace defenders simply failed to pick up his run.The visitors’ only serious threat by that stage had come after six minutes, when John Stones took on a little too much in attempting to justify his selection in midfield and almost presented Wilfried Zaha with an opportunity after being caught in possession in his own half.City could have done with Stones to help out in defence when Palace equalised six minutes after Gündoğan’s goal. Zaha got the better of Aymeric Laporte on the right, then as the ball was transferred across the edge of the area Jeffrey Schlupp found room to get round Walker and make space for a shot past Ederson.Before City had a chance to reply they were suddenly behind and again there were questions to be asked of the defence. A free-kick into the area was not properly cleared and after two weak headers in succession from Gündoğan and Bernardo Silva the ball reached Townsend just outside the area. The winger returned it with a spectacular volley into Ederson’s top-left corner.“It sat up perfectly,” the scorer said. “I knew I couldn’t take a touch as City would have been on me and away on the counter.”Pep Guardiola’s response was to send on Sergio Agüero early in the second half, not for the ineffective Gabriel Jesus as might have been expected, but for Nicolás Otamendi. That meant Stones was back in his usual position just in time to see Palace extend their lead.Aaron Wan-Bissaka took on the defence down the right and from his cutback Townsend was unlucky to see his header strike a post. Walker was overzealous in trying to clear the rebound, jumping in to a tackle and catching Max Meyer in the area, allowing the reliable Milivojevic to score emphatically from the spot.That prompted De Bruyne’s arrival on a rescue mission for the final half-hour, with Riyad Mahrez following him on to the pitch a few minutes later.Until the closing stages the nearest City came to a fightback was a Leroy Sané free-kick that struck an upright, though when De Bruyne beat Guaita five minutes from time with a dipping shot that looked suspiciously like a cross, the crowd woke up to encourage their side to retrieve at least a point.The best chance of City’s final push came in stoppage-time when what was definitely a De Bruyne cross found Jesus on the six-yard line, only for the Brazilian to head over.One heroic block by James Tomkins to deny Gündoğan later, Palace had their victory and a sorry week for Manchester managers was complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3be4c8f5b796432073ea737ef7136ff45f91bce/0_0_4031_2419/master/4031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f55adcf280bdda56b1301d47db30d2a7","title":"football then and now interactive quiz part six","story":"Can you identify these 10 football stadiums from the historical photographs?

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

They lost everything, but they took other jobs, started again and enabled my brother and me to finish our educations.Race meant nothing to me growing up in Bradford. I’m an Indian and grew up among Sikhs, Punjabis, Muslims, Pakistanis, white English and Lebanese. I was the only Asian kid in my school, but it wasn’t an issue.

I’ve been in a meeting where someone thought it was OK to do an Indian accent and I just laughed it off like everyone else. I wish I’d told them to stick it. That wasn’t too long ago either and there have been so many moments like that. I want to stop doing what I’ve been doing since I was a kid – not rocking the boat. I want to rock the boat.

I come from Wales, you do. I’m not posh, I happen to have been a broadcaster for a long time.”“You had a very distinguished father,” Humphrys retorted, referring to Richard Dimbleby OBE MBE, a leading news commentator for the BBC during the 1950s.“Well, that doesn’t make me posh, I had a distinguished father, that’s a ridiculous question,” Dimbleby said. “No, but the point is about the monarchy. I’m not close to the monarchy, I’ve met the Queen probably less often than you. I’ve met her once, I think. I have no connection at all.”“I don’t know why I made that assumption,” Humphrys said, before going on to question Dimbleby on what he thought about the monarchy.Asked what question he would ask himself in an interview, Dimbleby said: “Ever think of stopping? And I’d say ‘no, I just love asking questions, I’m not sure I like answering them.’”Humphrys thanked Dimbleby for guest-editing the Today programme, and noted that he is “positively not posh”.Many listeners were not so convinced. Online responses to the encounter have focused on the differences between the two BBC veterans’ backgrounds and education. Can a former public school boy who studied at Christ Church Oxford, sent a son to Eton, and is married to the granddaughter of an earl really argue he is not among the nation’s social elite?Even Spectator magazine acknowledged that the guest editor was on shaky ground. “Dimbleby is leading the way when it comes to traditional posh credentials at least,” he said. Listener @lucycthomas called for a rematch:It is true that Dimbleby and Humphrys both have Welsh mothers and began their careers as reporters, but there are few other similarities. To the average audience member, however, they may well both qualify as posh, given they have high salaries and speak with the “received pronunciation” favoured for BBC staffers until recent decades.Humphrys, one of five children, was born to a hairdresser and a self-employed French polisher in Adamsdown, Cardiff. When he passed the 11-plus exam he went on to Cardiff high school, then a grammar. Dimbleby, the elder brother of the Any Questions? radio presenter Jonathan Dimbleby, was born in Surrey to the leading BBC correspondent and presenter Richard Dimbleby. After prep school in Sussex, he went to Charterhouse school in Surrey. He read philosophy, politics and economics at Christ Church, Oxford, where he led the college’s student body, edited the student magazine Isis and was a member of the infamous all-male dining and drinking society, the Bullingdon Club. He graduated with a third-class honours degree.His son Henry Dimbleby, a co-founder of the food chain Leon, was revealed by Jacob Rees-Mogg on a Question Time of 2015 to have been his contemporary at Eton.Dimbleby, who was married to the cookery writer Josceline for 33 years, has been married since 2000 to Belinda Giles, the daughter of the former Sunday Times editor Frank, and granddaughter of the 9th earl of De La Warr. He chaired his last Question Time earlier this month and will be replaced by the BBC newsreader and Antiques Roadshow host Fiona Bruce next month.He still enjoys the political cut and thrust, though. A key element of the Today programme he edited was an interview with the editor of the Evening Standard, George Osborne.After questioning the former chancellor about Brexit, he asked the architect of Tory austerity if he felt homeless “deaths in doorways” were “a direct result of the austerity that you imposed”, which Osborne denied.He then asked Osborne to agree that his career after parliament had capitalised on his previous government position by “taking job after job after job and earning millions of pounds a year”.“You became prominent as chancellor and you now swan around the world making speeches and work for Blackrock, and earn several hundred thousand a year from them. It is as though, somehow, the business of going into politics, which you abandoned when it turned against you, was actually a pathway into what you are doing now, making a buck for yourself.”Osborne replied that he would not be editing a newspaper if he was prioritising his income. Dimbleby also revealed his previous attempts to assume high positions at the national broadcaster during the interview. “I twice tried to become director-general and I once tried to become chairman,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b554dcfc4591e1791802b5fe403696a518fa110a/289_107_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cc46c659a7bb4c716fd5abb76d05900","title":"online photo sharing internet safety children more savvy than parents","story":"Study reveals parents are less savvy than their offspring about the perils of posting family photosIt’s become an accepted part of keeping up to date with extended family and friends, but if schoolchildren were in their parents’ shoes, the majority wouldn’t share posts of their sons and daughters online.While some were concerned about being embarrassed or the longevity of content which could remain online indefinitely, others expressed concern about their personal data being compromised. One of the pupils surveyed said: “Although our parents mean well, sometimes the aftermath of a post can be disastrous.”In response to the poll, children’s mental health charity Place2Be and law firm Mischon de Reya have produced three films ahead of the Christmas holidays – the optimum period for parental oversharing.In one video, about safety online, 10-year-old Adavan said: “If you share anything with your family, you know who’s going to see it. But if you share it publicly, there are millions of people who can see your picture.”Joe Hancock, cyber security lead at Mischon de Reya, encouraged parents to share wisely. “Simple steps, such as checking your privacy settings and asking others not to share content of your children on their accounts if they have not updated their privacy settings, is a good start. And, as we found out from the children during filming, having their consent is key,” he said.The study marks a shift away from the usual debate about teaching children to use the internet safely. Sandra Davis, head of the law firm’s family department, said: “Children are the experts on the real and immediate impact of sharenting – the full extent of which we cannot know yet. We must ensure we listen to children and take their views into consideration now in order to avoid any unintended consequences further down the line.”Not all children were wary about the consequences of sharenting, though. Another child who took part in the survey said: “If I have children when I’m older, then I will most likely share pictures of them on Facebook. However, this would only be occasional and primarily just because I would be proud of my child and their accomplishments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16cc12f3e63d1d54a8a3e3fd5b5aa035e6891f96/0_71_1940_1163/master/1940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d8922eb251f1649c73e1ea38aad568","title":"women tv directors christmas left out in the cold","story":"Survey shows that men remain firmly in control of what we’ll be watching over the festive seasonMale directors will outnumber their female counterparts by six to one on British television this Christmas, despite growing pressure on the entertainment industry to improve equality of gender representation.The festive schedules reveal that only 24 of the 147 film and television directors represented on the main network channels are women, with those that do feature predominantly in charge of panel shows, soaps or children’s cartoon features.The damning figures have been uncovered by a Labour party research team who surveyed the listings for programmes and films being shown on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.The figures show that Channel 4 does slightly better than other channels, screening the work of seven female directors, including those of The Snowman and The Snowman and the Snowdog. In second place is BBC Two with five women directors in charge of shows such as Only Connect Quiz Special and Christmas University Challenge. ITV manages four shows directed by women, chiefly by virtue of running episodes of the popular soap operas Coronation Street and Emmerdale.But the commercial channel still does better than BBC One, which has just three women. One of those is the late Caroline Aherne, director of an acclaimed Christmas edition of her sitcom, The Royle Family, repeated on Christmas Eve.“The lack of representation of women directors in this year’s Christmas TV schedule shows how much more needs to be done to improve inclusion in the film and TV industries,” said Kevin Brennan MP, Labour’s shadow culture minister.The discrepancy evident this season can be partly explained by the traditional reliance on repeats of old favourites, such as a Two Ronnies episode, directed by Marcus Mortimer in 1993, or on vintage family films, such as Mary Poppins, directed by Robert Stevenson, and Joe Dante’s Gremlins. Yet men also feature heavily among the directors of the more recent family films being screened, such as Dan Scanlon’s 2013 Monsters University or the 2016 Disney cartoon Zootropolis, which was directed by three men.The two recent feature films made by women that will reach the small screen this Christmas date from 2011 and are both children’s animations. They are the Korean-American Jennifer Yuh Nelson’s Kung Fu Panda 2 and Sarah Smith’s Arthur Christmas, which she co-directed with Barry Cook. This supports the theory that it is easier for a woman to take the lead in children’s entertainment.The producers of funny shows and films also seem to be better at allowing women to take the creative helm. On Christmas Day, Debbie Isitt’s 2006 comedy Confetti will be screened on BBC Two, while Sharon Maguire’s hit Bridget Jones’s Diary will be shown on ITV.Reacting to the figures, Kaye Elliott, of the charity ScreenSkills, said that while “there is a way to go in terms of women directors”, it was also clear that targeted investment in areas of poor representation such as gender and ethnic background helped create opportunities. “It’s why we have run initiatives such as the drama directors programme with Directors UK to boost the number of women and other under-represented groups with practical experience and mentoring on prestige dramas,” said Elliott. “Obviously, there can be practical problems for women who also have caring responsibilities, given the intense schedules that are the norm in film and television. But these are issues that affect men, too. We are pleased to say that we have supported men as well as women to return to work after a parenting break through a scheme we have funded Film London to deliver.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cfa0ef09bc6c9e5a4fafa648949e8a2e290bb0c/0_282_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c22c503e98d48522b5c30f07bae007","title":"scotland reporting guardian politics","story":"’s Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks reflects on the increased visibility of women, the huge variety to her role, and the things she is still learningWhen I describe my job as a bit like being the foreign correspondent next door, it can raise eyebrows. It’s definitely not my intention to suggest that Scotland is so bafflingly other – nor that my London newsroom is so embarrassingly ignorant of Caledonian matters – that pain-staking translation is needed. But, while a berth in Glasgow may not be as obviously foreign as a posting to Paris or Moscow or Delhi, it does share some essentials in as much as my job involves reporting a place that feels culturally as much as geographically distinct from street level.As the ’s Scotland correspondent, working alongside our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, who is based in Edinburgh, I aim to reflect what’s concerning folk locally - when local does not mean within a two mile radius of Parliament Square – as well as what has impact nationally, or internationally. In explaining this country to the country next door, I often find myself writing about what Scotland does differently – most obviously through the ongoing ergence brought about by devolution, whether that’s the abolition of tuition fees in higher education, raising taxes for the wealthy or a new social security system that recognises welfare as a human right – as well as interrogating the impact of such policies. Free tuition has not, for example, significantly reduced the access gap for poorer students.Over the past year or so, I can think of examples of what Scotland does differently both good and bad: whether that is Glasgow’s pioneering work on knife crime, a landmark legal ruling on rape, the country’s shocking rate of drug-related deaths, or the Scottish government’s burgeoning private finance debt.Having grown up in Glasgow, I thought I understood the city I was returning to in May 2014, when I began a six-month secondment to assist Severin report the independence referendum campaign. I was wrong. Plunging into the feverish and politically complex atmosphere of the indyref was a near vertical learning curve. Four years later, after two seismic referendums and four election campaigns (two general, one Holyrood and one council), I still feel like there’s so much more to learn about this country.Having been so immersed in the vicissitudes of Westminster when I was editing on the opinion desk back in London, I discovered an entirely different climate in Scotland. Since the summer of 2014, we’ve tracked some of the most dramatic political shifts in the country’s history, not least the increasing support for the Scottish National party, which exploded after the independence referendum, the accompanying collapse in support for Scottish Labour and later the boost in popularity for the Scottish Conservatives under the leadership of Ruth Davidson.While it is of course essential to write with context, I’m also aware of the limits of regarding everything through the constitutional prism. Likewise, the swift and sharp online response when one is suspected of reporting in an even vaguely partisan fashion in either direction is an object lesson in the need to remain as scrupulously neutral as possible.One thing that immediately hit me was the visibility of women – when I arrived in the summer of 2014, the political landscape was crammed with impressive females – including Davidson, the then SNP deputy, now leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Labour’s Johann Lamont, as well as strong campaigning voices like Lesley Riddoch, Jeane Freeman and Clare Lally.I sometimes risk taking for granted the fact that Scotland’s first minister is a staunch feminist who is as comfortable offering a gender analysis of a policy as a constitutional one, or that I’ve worked with not one but two openly lesbian party leaders (Labour’s Kezia Dugdale and Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her first child).Nonetheless, this feminisation was by no means across all sectors. I was also shocked by the lack of women reporting politics – when I first entered the media tower at the Scottish parliament, I upped the female contingent there to three. Since then more women have joined the Holyrood lobby, and with a bunch of colleagues I helped set up the networking and campaigning organisation Women in Journalism Scotland, in 2016.One of the many reasons that I love my job is the variety: I can’t think of any other post where I’d find myself at a press conference with the first minister one day, the prime minister the next, then end the week discussing digital exclusion with a homeless outreach worker in Glasgow as the final tranche of universal credit transfers are rolled out across the city. It’s a truly privileged position to be in – to be reminded that the high politics have an impact on real lives, and to work for an organisation that will give equal weight to each story.But with that variety comes the agony of choice. There’s so much going on across the country, it’s fair to say that Severin and I could fill our working weeks thrice over quite comfortably. Part of the role is about deciding what and how to prioritise, and judging when a story has reached a sufficient level of interest that it will appeal to a global-facing newsdesk. It can also involve acting in a more directional capacity, suggesting potential columnists to the opinion desk or events to the culture desk, or providing some Scottish texture to our UK-wide reporting, whether that’s the demise of the high street or the anti-Trump protests.I know that readers don’t always agree with what we prioritise, and I’m always happy to hear why. In my early days on the Scotland beat I found Twitter and below the line prompts and suggestions invaluable – and occasionally face-saving (I’m looking at you Mae, Tenthred and Great Baldy).Over the past few years there’s been a significant shift in the centre of gravity of the , as it has opened offices across the US and Australia. I’ve watched the organisation becoming more global at the same time as it has become more local. With our Manchester office, ably headed up by our northern editor Helen Pidd, boosted by a clutch of new reporters since 2015, and Steve Morris and Rory Carroll doing their brilliant reporting across Wales, the south-west of England and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, it does feel like the entirety of the UK is now represented through our coverage like a stick of rock.The observant reader will note that my initial six-month secondment to Glasgow ended some time ago. The position of a second Scotland team member was made permanent in 2015, and I was utterly delighted to stay because – well, the story just kept getting better. I hope that I never take for granted the privilege of getting paid to ask interesting people (what I hope are) interesting questions and learning something new every day. Meanwhile, my toddler son is developing a broader Scottish accent than I have. Who knows what the future holds, but for now I have a sneaking suspicion that I didn’t know it was time to come home until I got there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3127b0214d69efab2b5a63db9beeb391198209b/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c28a943da84bcc327571d8c0a107b05f","title":"im an asylum seeker ive not been allowed to work for three years","story":"Rose was trafficked from Nigeria to work as a prostitute. She escaped and started a new lifeI was 21 when I was trafficked from Nigeria to London. I was helping out washing dishes in a cafe in Lagos when a woman promised to find me a job overseas. I kind of regarded her as a mother figure as my own mum had recently died from a terminal illness.I was tempted. I’d just gone through unbearable pain. Before my mum passed away, she’d suffered a lot of abuse from my father’s family when my dad died. My mum was blamed for his death. They called her a witch and accused her of killing my father. She was tortured. She was made to go through a process that no one should ever go through.Around the same time, I was being forced into an arranged marriage with an older man and made to undergo female genital mutilation. I ended up running away from my home town and moving to Lagos. I thought this woman would help change my fortunes that I’d move abroad and make money by helping out in a factory or cleaning houses and I could send money back to my 11-year-old sister.Instead I was shocked to discover that this woman had organised for me to be a prostitute. I was told that I had to pay back the money used to bring me here. It was less than human. It was against every basic belief and right that I knew. We weren’t allowed out on our own. There were always men guiding us. They made us swear an oath that we wouldn’t disappoint them. They abused us. We were forced to do unthinkable things. It was hellish.It only came to an end five years later when I was in a hair salon in Peckham, London, where I was allowed to spend time learning how to do African braids. A female customer came in and spoke Hausa, a language spoken back in Nigeria, and started asking me if this was my job. I ended up telling her my situation and she promised to help me. She came up with a plan to meet her one evening, and so I escaped and stayed with her. She was a cleaner and so at first I used to help out on her jobs. After a while I started fending for myself, and I met someone and we started a family.Since then I have applied for asylum so I can stay in the UK and the Home Office has moved myself and my son and daughter to Bradford. I’ve not been allowed to work for three years. I have always wanted to better myself by gaining some form of education and so last year I completed the level 2 diploma in health and social care. I was about to register for level 3 but the college said because of my status I am not eligible and so would have to pay the £4,300 myself. It broke my world. It reminded me that even though I’m safe, I’m still a prisoner. I don’t have freedom. I cannot work … I want my son and daughter, aged 10 and seven, to see me as someone doing something, not sat at home doing nothing. I’m grateful, but it’s not me.The house we live in is crumbling but at least we have a roof over our heads. We live off an allowance of £100 a week. The kids cannot get the basics they need. The money is mainly spent on food. My daughter was lagging behind in school, especially in maths, and so I enrolled her in private lessons. It’s £30 a week – it’s a big sacrifice but I want their futures to be better than mine.I’ve tried to integrate by joining the local church and volunteering at an Oxfam shop. I sometimes buy clothes there with my staff discount. I want my kids to see me doing something. We want the chance to work while we’re waiting. Idleness eats into your brain. At times I’ve been suicidal. I don’t want this life for myself. I could be working and contributing to the system. What they give is not enough. We want the chance to work ourselves. I want my kids to see me as a role model.Refugee Action helps refugees and people seeking asylum to build safe, happy, and productive lives in the UK. The charity wants to lift the ban which prevents people seeking asylum from being able to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d445b90ee5aa17950e85fc83cb85875a0a0bfdb1/0_120_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73463175b419a179afaa6c5aaffea5d6","title":"tell us what was your album of 2018","story":"We will publish a selection of readers’ favourite albums before the end of the yearAfter canvassing over 50 of our music writers and totting up their votes, we’ve announced our 50 best albums of the year, topped by Christine and the Queens’ sensual neo-boogie classic Chris.But a list of 50 –\u0026nbspand you can see the whole thing here – inevitably misses out out dozens of brilliant albums, so we’d love to hear from you about the recordings you think were unfairly overlooked by our vote.

But Britain’s most savage satirist is going to give it a go...Consider the plight of the satirist. I know you’ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who’s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you’re right, it’s not much of a plight at all, really.The plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn’t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were:1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend.2 A group of deranged kippers burning a cardboard effigy of Grenfell tower. They were later quizzed by police, and Kensington and Chelsea council, who asked them to quote for some public housing projects. 3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook’s monopoly power.4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend.5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia.6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase “rules-based international order”, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed.7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can’t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was “fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement”. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians.Beyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters.Domestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter isions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders.Theresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking “Chequers is dead” as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, “Fuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!” I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice.I say, let’s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won’t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of “talking foreign” and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles.Paradoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they’re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they’ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse’s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone.It is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn’t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn’t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that ersity is bad, but there don’t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all.The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it’s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below “fix the spare room door”.And yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year’s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn’t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I’m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac.Perhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam’s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It’s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath.Yet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag – despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain’s reputation, provided it never docks.Of course it’s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a £100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they’re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to “go fuck themselves”. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea.The murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers’ wing.You can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon.The murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it’s got David Davis’s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I’d love to see the ones they rejected. “We regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.” They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase.We apparently “share values” with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I’m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car.Our government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop.Saudi’s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop in China, a government official and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who’s mastered Pitman shorthand.Perhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody’s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty.There’s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they’ll reply, “Very well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.” Yet shouldn’t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don’t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn’t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful.Of course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: “We are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.” I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is – realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you’d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can’t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans’ current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished.Trump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory – not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can’t speak English. It’s not that he’s normalising his own behaviour it’s that, by comparison, he’s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison.The racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike’s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he’s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands.What does it say about our times that we’re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of “Just do it” started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I’ve always been wary of Nike – I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I’m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner’s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you’re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.)Despite Trump’s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It’s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided.Of course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent.There is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn’t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators.With Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There’s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages.A climate of fearAt least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein’s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I’m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to “…from sea to boiling sea”.Climate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world’s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact.The death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn’t it? The real tragedy is not that we can’t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth.Consider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It’s a hard thing to consider. It’s OK to admit that, I think – that it’s hard to empathise: you don’t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it’s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason.I mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don’t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves – and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed. Consider the plight of the satirist.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/168d139211d229138ebda58d1e8f8c708e327c90/30_58_2865_1719/master/2865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8da75a1e46f07bee17971d63284b495","title":"mps whatsapp chats jeremy corbyn","story":"It’s how plots are hatched, deals are done and party lines agreed – but what really gets said in Westminster’s notorious WhatsApp groups?If you ever get the chance, take time to observe MPs sitting in the House of Commons. Roughly half will be paying some kind of attention to the debate the rest will be on their phones. Of these, some will be on Twitter, either to compose bons mots or check the number of retweets and likes they have got. A few will be checking they still exist: I once caught Julian Huppert, a Lib Dem MP up until the 2015 general election, Googling himself during a select committee hearing.Most, though, are likely to be on WhatsApp, the messaging service, advancing their careers or targeting the downfall of someone else’s. In the past, most plotting was done in Westminster’s bars and private rooms. Now it’s done via WhatsApp. When you hear a succession of government spokespeople appear on the radio and the TV using much the same language to talk down the significance of some new crisis, such as the resignation last month of transport minister Jo Johnson, it is not due to an outburst of spontaneous consensus. Rather, it is the result of a WhatsApp network agreeing a party line for everyone to repeat for media consumption.The advantage of WhatsApp is that it is securely encrypted, meaning that politicians feel free to express what they really think, rather than what they would like people to think they think. WhatsApp is politicians unplugged. Which isn’t to say that WhatsApp messages never get leaked, only that they get leaked on purpose. There are the groups whose contents are designed to remain confidential, and there are the groups in which everyone knows there are one or two members who are unable to prevent themselves from blabbing to the press.The trick for any politician is to keep track of which WhatsApp group is which, and to post the right message to the right group. Sometimes this is easier said than done. There is the cabinet WhatsApp group, the Leave-supporting cabinet “Monday Pizza Nights” group. There’s the Remain-supporting Tory backbenchers. There’s the 70-strong European Research Group (ERG), led by Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg. There is the shadow cabinet. There are the unofficial opposition of Labour moderates. Then there are the known unknowns. And almost certainly the unknown unknowns.What do they talk about? Handily, I’ve taken a peek at what might have been some of the key chats of this tumultuous year.Jacob Rees-Mogg How many letters of no confidence do we have now?JRM That’s what I’m worried about.SB OK, well, at least 50…SB On my life, we’ve got 40 nailed on. Cross my heart and hope to die.JRM Very well. So you’re saying that if I, too, were to submit a letter to the 1922 committee, then others would follow and we would reach the 48 we need to trigger a leadership challenge?SB Count on it. I’ll organise a press conference outside parliament.Boris Johnson I hope you don’t mind me butting in. I’m behind you all the way. I see this as a huge opportunity in our nation’s history for me to become prime minister. I’ve had my hair cut specially.SB Sorry about that. I got my fours and twos muddled up.

That would have taught them a lesson.Dominic Raab Dover is a lot closer to Calais then I had imagined...JRM How lovely to hear from you, Dominic! But what are you doing in this group?DR I’ve resigned from the government.JRM Have you? I hadn’t noticed.Priti Patel Let’s think big. We could get rid of this backstop agreement forever by just starving the Irish into submission.JRM Expletives help no one, Mark. And while I personally have some sympathy for starving the Irish, I think we need to be very careful about stirring up the historical legacy of the potato famine.PP Why? Whoever heard of a potato going hungry?JRM So our plan is just to say no to everything and hope that sooner or later something happens? Let’s get out and sell this on the airwaves...SB Right-ho, chaps, I’ve got our crack troops lined up. James Gray, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Suella Braverman and Ben Bradley...BJ I hope you don’t mind me butting in. I’m behind you all the way.

Our plan remains unchanged.KS But the Tories have pulled the meaningful vote…JC Have they? We still stand firm. Our priority is to promise a Brexit that delivers on the will of the people by offering the country a whole lot of things the Tories are not offering and which the EU won’t give us.KS But that isn’t an alternative plan?JM Then we shall be demanding a general election with me as leader of the Labour party…JC Hang on a minute, aren’t I the leader?JM Yes, of course. But the media do quite like me.KS Guys, guys, there isn’t going to be a general election. The Tories and the DUP aren’t going to bring down the government. We need to have a position on the second referendum.JC We’ve got one. All options are on the table…KS But what does that mean. Are we for one or against one?

We all know you’re thrilled to be back in the cabinet. No one’s listening. The PM never checks this group.

You were sacked weeks ago.DR I resigned, actually.AL I must have forgotten to delete you.Andrea Leadsom removed Dominic Raab from the group.AL Does anyone know who the new Brexit secretary is?Gavin Williamson Haven’t a clue.

The PM has just phoned me to say she definitely has no intention of pulling the vote and has sent me on to Marr to reassure MPs.SJ Yup. She’s definitely pulling the vote.Michael Gove Actually, the PM has also phoned me to say the vote is going ahead. Let’s speak later, after I’ve told the Today programme what’s going on.PH I can’t believe Mikey has fallen for it, too.SJ Me, neither. He’s going to look such an idiot.

Have I missed anything?PH Only your entire life.Jeremy Wright Do I exist or am I just a hologram?SJ No one knows.AR Pull yourselves together, everyone. I think Theresa has absolutely done the right thing. The best deal on offer wasn’t the best deal on offer and it’s important she goes back to Brussels to negotiate a better deal that can’t be bettered.AL On the plus side, pulling the debate gives us more time to scrutinise the Lords’ amendments to the ivory bill.PM Does anyone have a plan?JH Forget the DMs. Anyone who wants to back my leadership bid gets first pick of their cabinet job.SJ Same goes for me.AR What about you, Philip?PH I’ll be fine. I took out a huge bet on sterling going down and the stock market tumbling. Happy days!SJ Fuck. The ERG have got the 48 letters. There’s going to be a no-confidence vote, after all.AR Now is the time for us to all get behind...JH Oh, do give it a rest, Amber. How much longer are we lumbered with Theresa for?PH No one knows.

We also know that there is still some EU-wide coordination going on behind the scenes. But it shouldn’t be left up to the EU27 to give us reassurances, which is where a no-deal leaves us.“The responsibility falls squarely on the UK government to do all it can to make sure its citizens, wherever they live, are protected,” she said.Brussels has urged European governments to take a generous approach to protecting the rights of 1 million Britons living in the EU if the UK leaves without a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/045f1ff227e943977bcbedee86b135f2cb88aa69/0_100_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b3a299dfadb62a855147773d514d72","title":"paddy ashdown a political life in pictures","story":"A look back at some of the public moments of the former Liberal Democrats leader, who has died aged 77"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1032ad628073600d169305946eb933df06ff462e/0_59_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a802dc9d62b7624130f3dcbea38d15","title":"exeter saracens premiership match report","story":"Christmas comes around about as often as Saracens lose games of rugby nowadays but this was a seasonal stuffing in every respect. After 22 matches unbeaten in all competitions the Premiership champions were abruptly dragged back to earth by a fiercely motivated Chiefs side who, for now, sit three points above their main rivals at the top of the domestic tree.The foundations of Exeter’s best result of the season were again laid up front, with Saracens ultimately second best in areas they normally dominate. Luke Cowan-Dickie, promoted to start at the 11th hour, made a striking return at hooker opposite England’s Jamie George, Scotland’s Sam Skinner delivered another telling performance and the impact of Harry Williams and Ben Moon off the bench left Saracens with absolutely nowhere to go.Perhaps the most telling snapshot of the day came as Chiefs’ pack rampaged over for a close-range penalty try just as a weary Mako Vunipola and George were walking slowly towards the main stand having been replaced. The two Lions did not even need to glance over their shoulders with the raucous West Country cheers already telling them everything they needed to know.A last-minute converted score from a resurgent Matt Kvesic also earned the Chiefs a bonus point and put the tin lid on Saracens’ heaviest league defeat for 19 months. Exeter were also the last team to beat them in the Premiership last March and, having lost 27-10 to Saracens in last season’s final, will view this result as a positive omen for 2019. “At times we made Saracens look a bit ragged,” said the Chiefs’ director of rugby Rob Baxter. “If we play them again there are some areas where we think we can gain some momentum against them.”Saracens’ Mark McCall freely admitted his side – “We were well beaten in most areas” – were second best after a bright start, their downturn coinciding with the departure of their skipper Brad Barritt with concussion at the start of the second quarter. With Michael Rhodes also suffering a painful shoulder knock and both Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola currently sidelined, the champions are starting to show some end-of-year signs of wear and tear.Exeter, despite two early Owen Farrell penalties, took full advantage, with Cowan-Dickie, only drafted in to start at short notice when the Chiefs’ captain Jack Yeandle withdrew because of illness, gleefully collecting the rebound after Skinner had charged down Ben Spencer’s clearance. Saracens’ early composure soon began to fray, with their wing Alex Lewington enduring a particularly torrid 40 minutes beneath the high ball, and their set-piece also started to creak. With Exeter, as ever, rejecting penalty shots in favour of kicks to the corner, however, there was no further scoring until Steenson finally slotted a penalty from in front of the posts in the final moments of the half.Chiefs’ 10-6 interval lead was hardly imposing but in a tight, gritty contest it had real psychological value. Even with the giant Will Skelton on for Rhodes, the Chiefs duly exerted the majority of the pressure in the third quarter, with the sight of the lightly-built Steenson forcing Vunipola back in the tackle indicative of the hosts’ mindset.Even before Williams bagged another powerful try for his collection, Schalk Burger was sent to the sin-bin for illegally trying to prevent the Chiefs’ third score and Kvesic’s final flourish trumped Ben Spencer’s consolation effort, there was only one side in it.With the season due to reach its halfway point this coming weekend, it also underlined the scale of the task awaiting those hoping to nip in and deprive Chiefs of a fourth successive Twickenham final appearance. Even without the injured likes of Henry Slade, who should return for Friday’s trip to Northampton, Jack Nowell, Dave Ewers, Jonny Hill and Olly Woodburn, Exeter have scored more tries than any team in the league over the season’s first 10 games and conceded the fewest as well. “We weren’t faultless but we worked hard and we were pretty tough,” stressed Baxter, whose team have lost once to Saracens in their last five meetings. “It gives me real confidence that if we do what we do with real energy we’re a good side.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4bb3574145e2c600137a78171b8d3027db2ff3b/110_102_3161_1897/master/3161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb250ea014539cb6125812400c5917f7","title":"leicester harlequins premiership match report","story":"The losing run ends at eight. Leicester marked the start of Geordan Murphy’s tenure as permanent head coach with a bonus point win, much as they did the start of his tenure as caretaker.Just a cursory glance of the Tigers’ line-up is enough to bewilder anyone pondering their recent travails. The England half-backs, an all-international midfield, same in the front row and on the wings. They should be able to play a bit and it turns out they can. What is more, they had been ravaged by illness all week.“Over half of the squad were affected,” said Murphy, “so we shut up shop on Wednesday afternoon and did not do any training. There was tonsillitis, there was flu, there were colds – it was horrific.”It did not seem to affect them. Quins did well to stay as close as they did, James Lang’s penalties keeping them in the game and two second-half tries, the second at the death gave, them a chance of a bonus point. As it is, they feel Leicester’s breath on their necks, the Tigers climbing from three points off the bottom to a point behind Quins in the top six.It says something about this league that a team of such names could find themselves flirting with relegation. With George Ford masterful, it became clear early on they were intent on ending that horror run of defeats after last week’s eighth edition.Two years after the second world war is the last time Leicester lost nine in a row. It is the only time. The motivation to avoid such an indignity again looked bracing. The last time they had lost eight in a row, after all, was 43 years ago. Nine was evidently too much.Pricked as so often by the rampaging contributions of Ellis Genge, Leicester were on the offensive from the word go. His break, developed, by Mike Fitzgerald, set up Ford to open the scoring with a penalty in the sixth minute. Then the maestro turned supplier, delaying a pass gorgeously for Jonah Holmes to slice through the bemused Quins defence for a 10-point lead.Quins owed three of their first six points to a curious incident. Welford Road held its breath while Manu Tuilagi lay motionless after a tackle. He had been in bed all of Friday. Here he was prone again.Luke Pearce, fearing a concussion, blew to stop play, whereupon Tuilagi jumped to his feet and said he was fine. “In which case that’s a penalty for not rolling away,” replied Pearce. While the doctor checked Tuilagi’s condition, Pearce allowed Lang to continue with the kick. Happily, Tuilagi was passed fit. Quins trailed by four points without having had to do much.Ford’s second penalty on the half-hour mark was followed immediately by Holmes’s second try. Tatafu Polota-Nau latched on to a Quins tap down at the restart and found Holmes on his shoulder for the score. A further penalty apiece left the score 23-9 at the break, the least Leicester deserved.So they became a little twitchy when Lang’s fourth penalty reduced Quins’ deficit to 11 five minutes into the second half. Still Leicester’s approach play, with Ford pulling the strings adroitly, was snappier. When a monstrous penalty from his own half set Tigers up on the five-metre line they overthrew. Ford put them there again a few minutes later this time Quins stopped the maul dead.Leicester’s third try eventually came in the 56th minute. Dan Cole found the ball in his great mitts twice in the same passage and ran about as far as he must have with the ball in his entire career. The second trundle took him close to the line, before Ford and Jonny May worked Tuilagi into the corner.Quins replied with their first try a few minutes later, Mike Brown off-loading to release Cadan Murley, but Leicester had the bonus point in the 68th minute. Tuilagi set up another attack, which May finished after sweet hands from Ford and Matt Toomua.Alex Dombrandt crashed over for a second Quins try a second before time, so the visitors declined the conversion so that the game might restart. They could not clinch a bonus point, which would have flattered them. Leicester, instead, march on with one of their own and the first hints of a new confidence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd2588c2dddb2a1e14531ad85a679dbcc0c41795/0_352_6809_4086/master/6809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd8c1e9e38e54fd5e8140185c8c07f93","title":"readers travel photography competition december winners","story":"Our final selection of the year ranges from New York cops to Venice shops, camel fairs to penguins.

It now owes $9.2m on a note due in October 2019 but donations have slowed and attempts to secure a state government grant have met determined resistance.In a statement, the foundation said a sale may be necessary. Negotiations and fundraising continue: a GoFundMe page had by Saturday raised a little over $33,000. But material is being culled for potential debt reduction “without selling off core items”.The museum contains riches: examples of Lincoln’s earliest known writings his presidential seal, with wax remnants from its last use an 1839 legal brief that contains the signatures of Lincoln for the plaintiff and his rival Stephen A Douglas for the defence the blood-soaked kid gloves the 16th president had in his pocket when he was killed.But it also contains many items that could be considered expendable. For example, there are five dozen playbills, letters and lithographs which belonged to Junius Brutus Booth, the father of Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth. The older Booth died in 1852, eight years before Lincoln was elected.There is also an 1874 invitation to the wedding of the daughter of President Ulysses Grant, a 1928 memo to the wife of the law partner of Lincoln’s son Robert Todd Lincoln and a 1948 limited edition copy of Stephen Vincent Benet’s poem John Brown’s Body.Selling such items would hardly make a dent in the debt. Online, a copy of Benet’s poem from the same printing goes for under $100. Several years ago, a New York dealer sold an 1851 Junius Booth playbill for $400.“You can’t take nine of those pieces and come up with $9m,” said Brian Kathenes, a New Jersey-based appraiser. “You’d probably have to go after some of the better stuff or sell a lot more of it off.”That will be difficult to do. Harold Holzer, an award-winning Lincoln scholar, said museums routinely sell duplicative items or “second-rate things” acquired along with prized treasures.“But not to pay the rent,” he said, “because the temptation is too large to defenestrate the place in order to pay for the walls. The walls were built to protect the material. The material is not there to protect the walls.“Everything that you remove exponentially cripples the institution. It makes things worse, not better. Even if you collect some money, your reputation is so scarred that I don’t think it would ever recover.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0cfc6511aa1b6757b9bdb1f80fa98e1c172720c/0_169_5047_3029/master/5047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f768931732e74d3d6b6549db15c58b","title":"extra 2m cars on uk roads for festive shopping and visits","story":"Saturday expected to be busy with traffic peaking again at lunchtime on Christmas EveDriving home for Christmas could best be done on Sunday, according to motoring organisations, with an additional 2.2m cars expected on the roads on Saturday for festive leisure trips, whether to shops or to visit relatives.The M40 northbound from Oxford into the West Midlands is most likely to land drivers in traffic on Saturday, according to the RAC and traffic analyst Inrix. Delays of more than an hour are forecast from junction 8A of the M40 to the M42 link road.Traffic generally would peak between 10.30am and 4pm, the RAC said, advising drivers to travel before 9.30am or after 7.30pm.After a relatively quiet Sunday, traffic is expected to peak again around lunchtime on Christmas Eve, when delays of around 20 minutes can be expected on parts of the M1 in the east Midlands.The worst of the Christmas getaway though has passed for motorists, on so-called Frantic Friday, when leisure travellers mixed with regular commuting traffic. An estimated 19 million drivers were out on Britain’s roads on Friday, according to the AA.Queues of slow-moving traffic were adding almost an hour to inter-city car journeys north out of London on Friday lunchtime, with the M40, M6 and M1 particularly busy, while journeys west on the M4 and A303 were also slowed by around 20 minutes.Rail services will be disrupted over Christmas for engineering works – as well as strikes in parts. Beyond the usual shutdown for 25 and 26 December, a number of key rail services will either be closed or reduced over the coming 10 days. Network Rail insisted that the majority of the railway would be unaffected, although it would be carrying out work worth £148m on 330 projects over the holiday season.Beleaguered passengers who have not been automatically provided with a rail replacement bus could turn to the coach, with National Express set to lay on an additional seats for 50,000 passengers over the holidays – including Christmas Day, when all other public transport options have been dashed. According to Trainline, most coach bookings for 25 December have been made for a lunchtime exodus from London to Liverpool.Among the most affected rail services will be lines out of London Paddington, with the west London station closed for an additional three days in late December. Half of London Victoria will be shut down from this Sunday until the start of 2019, as work closes one of the main lines into the station from Clapham Junction, Britain’s busiest rail interchange. The Gatwick Express fast airport service will not run for the duration.Stansted Express services will be reduced during work on the lines east from the capital to London’s third airport. East Midlands and Thameslink trains running north of St Pancras will also be affected by engineering.Christmas strikes by the RMT union, in the ongoing row about the future role and responsibilities of guards on trains, will disrupt Northern and South Western railway services. Northern services will come to an early end from around 5pm on Saturday and next Saturday, while the South Western network out of Waterloo will operate a reduced strike service on 27 December and New Year’s Eve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da5821dbfb34591f7e98ff277082e2edcb0bf42/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95574c41a2ee15cccc4f3d6e4b23c5fe","title":"thousands of hungarians join latest rally against orbans slave law","story":"One of labour reforms allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtimeThousands of Hungarians marched to the presidential palace late on Friday to protest against labour reforms as a rally led by spoof political party MKKP merged with a subsequent demonstration staged by opposition groups.Passage of two laws last week backed by prime minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party angered a variety of groups.One, dubbed by critics the “slave law”, allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtime. Another would set up new courts which critics say could be politically manipulated.MKKP’s gathering started outside parliament, where one protester brandished a placard saying “Happy boss, gloomy Sunday”.The Two-Tailed Dog party (MKKP), launched over a decade ago as a joke, has become a semi-serious force, using ironic humour to tackle practical issues. “I wanted to come because I consider the Dog party to be the most serious of all in the current lineup, which is rather sad,” said Almos Edes, 26, a university student holding a sign saying ‘We promise everything’ beneath a logo of Fidesz.Edes was sceptical of any change being triggered by the rallies, but said he had joined to make his voice heard.Friday’s rally also took aim at grievances including regulations that have led to the departure of the Central European University, founded by Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, from Budapest.“We can finally work eight days a week. We no longer need to hassle with independent courts. Homelessness has been eliminated. Irritating foreign schools will vanish. And Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros,” said an invitation to the rally posted on Facebook.Orban has said the protests have been partly stoked by activists paid by Soros, an accusation Soros’s Open Society Foundation has denied.Demonstrators, subsequently joined by another rally called by opposition groups, then marched up to the presidential palace in Buda Castle, briefly blocking a bridge crossing the Danube River."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43cddfce65bd65eee7f15aab906287369b511edb/927_3714_5265_3159/master/5265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f039e25eb9f3060274866ca0494373e1","title":"what happened next weekend stories 2018 blind date","story":"Did the arts campaigners bring change – and did any Blind Date couples make it official? Following up the year’s Weekend storiesMeanwhile, Simon Hattenstone reported on cleaning up UK sport. In July, Goldie Sayers was finally awarded her bronze medal in the javelin from the 2008 Olympics, after Russian silver medallist Mariya Abakumova tested positive for drugs during a re-analysis of her sample.In February, we challenged four writers to give up plastic for a week. Stuart Heritage was getting through a mountain of nappies, and bought a SodaStream to try to reduce the number of plastic water bottles he used. His town now has a packaging-free shop, so his rice, pasta, spices and salt doesn’t even touch plastic. “Best of all,” he says, “one of our children poos in the toilet now: landfills of Britain, you are welcome.” Ian Jack, meanwhile, has now cut back on the takeaways and goes out for Chinese, Indian and Vietnamese: “Yes, we’ve cut back on the takeaways, and most of them these days are from a pizza place, that packs its pizzas in plain brown cardboard boxes that look very recyclable. If we want Indian, Chinese or Vietnamese food, we go out and eat it, though a favourite local Chinese takeaway, Zing Zing, now promises in its online manifesto that “most of our containers are recyclable and come from a supplier that uses socially responsible techniques during the manufacturing process.” Maybe more takeaways could adopt this practice. A lot of stuff in our refuse bins is still plastic, of course – bottles for shampoo, bathroom cleaner and so on – but I think less than before.Earlier that same month, Hattie Garlick reported on a scheme at Dartmoor prison, training inmates in mediation to encourage non-violent communication. Since then, the scheme has expanded – it now has 12 facilitators, six of whom are full time – and plans to expand to another wing next year. According to Maria Arpa, who is leading the project, staff have noticed that the Dialogue Road Map she introduced has increased safety on the wings for prisoners and staff.In April, John Harris wrote about families who have been separated by visa restrictions introduced by Theresa May during her time at the Home Office. The rules mean that if you meet someone abroad and want to live with them in the UK, you must be earning at least £18,600 a year the result is that around 15,000 children are thought to be living without one of their parents.Laura Clarke, who lives in Rugby with her son Elijah, is still fighting to be reunited with his father, Biniyam, who is stranded in Ethiopia. Under “exceptional circumstances” rules, she has once again applied for a visa for him, and spent thousands of pounds in the process. “Both Elijah and I have not seen Biniyam since early October 2017,” she says. “He’s missed another birthday and now he’ll miss another Christmas.”Tom Shelton went through a painful period in County Durham, while his wife Annie and her son were forced to remain in the Philippines. In October, he left the UK for six months to rejoin his family. “It’s great to be together again,” he says. “Wonderful and worrying at the same time. In the UK, Annie would earn more than £20k a year, but here she gets £7 a day: a good salary locally, but it just covers rent and food. There’s no ability to save.” Sally Williams’ report in May on women who carried the BRCA mutation, a gene that dramatically increases the risk of getting ovarian or breast cancer, encouraged more women to sign up for a study that Daniel Reisel, coordinator of the BRCA research clinic at University College London, had recently launched. Called BRCA Unite, supported by the gynaecological cancer charity the Eve Appeal, it is investigating what saves some women with the mutation and why.In May, Diane Taylor wrote about Jimmy Thoronka, a sprinter from Sierra Leone who three years ago was homeless and living in a park, after vanishing following the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Thoronka was finally granted discretionary leave to remain in the UK for two and a half years this April. He continues to train at the Mile End track in east London and is being coached by Lloyd Cowan and Clarence Callender. He is also working for Sainsbury’s, coaching children, and hopes to complete a course in personal training next year. He still lives with Taylor and her partner, Simon Hattenstone.Rupert Neate reported in May on the deaths of three young Britons while working for billionaires on multimillion-pound superyachts . Since then, at least two more crew members have died, including Rebecca Boyle, 32, a stewardess from London, who died on the Italian riviera this summer. A coroner found that Boyle died of injuries sustained when she fell on her way back to her cabin from the yacht’s hot tub. Meanwhile, the 40-strong crew of the Indian Empress – a $95m superyacht owned by former Formula One team owner Vijay Mallya – were awarded more than £700,000 in back pay, more than a year after Mallya abandoned the yacht and crew in Malta following his arrest on £1bn fraud charges.In July, Jonathan Watts and photographer Thom Pierce profiled seven environmental activists risking their lives to protect land around the world. In November, there was good news for Nonhle Mbuthuma: after a long and, at times, violent struggle against powerful mining interests, the Amadiba campaigner and her community won a landmark legal case in the South African high court. The judge ruled that the government must have permission from local people before it can offer mining concessions. Elsewhere, many activists continue to face enormous and often deadly dangers. On August 11, Weekend published a gal-dem magazine takeover, in which every byline, photograph and illustration was contributed by a woman or non-binary person of colour. That weekend saw an extra 7,000 copies of the newspaper sold an additional 500 copies of the magazine made available through the  Bookshop (a first) sold out in days. gal-dem editor and deputy editor Liv Little and Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff say the issue felt like “a defining moment in becoming a fully fledged business.It’s often the first thing people want to talk to us about”.In September, Sally Williams reported on the family of Nur Begum, who are among the million Rohingya refugees sheltering in the world’s largest refugee camp in Bangladesh. The family is now facing its second winter in the camp. The Bangladeshi government announced it would begin repatriations to Myanmar in November, but the transport buses remain empty. “There is likely to be a further push next year,” a spokesperson from Oxfam says. “It’s clear that it’s not safe for refugees to go back, and there’s little progress on granting them the equal rights that they want.”Nur has since become unwell. “She has a cough,” her daughter-in-law Zaheda says, “so she is staying close to the camp’s medical centre.” But there was good news for Rashida, 25, Nur’s youngest daughter, and a mother of four, who had been abandoned by her husband Jamir: he has since returned. “They are happy,” Zaheda says, “and I am feeling happy about that. I long to go home, but we are afraid of what could happen to us in Myanmar.”In September, writer Dina Nayeri went to Katsikas refugee camp in Greece with Refugee Support, to report on how the charity is trying to revolutionise the way camps distribute aid. Since their visit, Katsikas has doubled its capacity to 1,000 refugees after adjusting to the number of new arrivals, the mini-market that Refugee Support opened there is thriving. It launched a pilot Empowerment Fund in July, where it asked people in the camp for business ideas to promote self-sufficiency – it has so far funded 12 ideas, from bike hire to pie making.Joe Hammond wrote about his terminal diagnosis of motor neurone disease, and why he is writing cards and letters for his young sons to open on their birthdays after his death. He has now completed 26 of his planned 33 cards, typing the final seven after the weakness in his right hand made his handwriting illegible. “My body is failing fast, but life remains richer than it ever did before,” Hammond says. Since the article appeared, he has corresponded with a huge number of  readers who lost a parent as a child, while 4th Estate publishers bought world rights to the book. Hammond can now do very little for himself in January, he will have a feeding tube fitted.Also in September, Anna Moore told the story of Sally Challen, who is appealing her life sentence for murdering her husband on the grounds that she was a victim of coercive control throughout their marriage. Sally’s hearing has been postponed twice, and is now listed for February 2019, more than two years since Sally’s grounds for appeal were originally submitted. Sally’s son, David Challen, describes the wait as “excruciating”. Meanwhile, on 22 November, Justice for Women – the campaigning group behind Sally’s case – won leave to appeal for Emma-Jayne Magson, who is also serving a life sentence for killing her partner.In October, Jess Cartner-Morley reinvented her column to reflect the new eco-aware mood in fashion. She was, she admits, anxious about how the piece would be received. “I worried that the truly ethical would shoot my efforts down for not being rigorous enough, because I still buy and recommend new clothes, as well as championing ‘shopping’ from your existing wardrobe. Also that my front row crew would drop me, Mean Girls-style, for being photographed in clothes that cost £30 a decade ago.” But the reaction was overwhelmingly positive. “Some of my favourite responses were from fashionistas who confided that they were cutting down on new purchases, too.”Josh Jacobs revealed the abuse and misuse of MPs’ staffers in October. Since the article appeared, the House of Commons announced that Gemma White QC will launch an independent investigation into Westminster work culture. Jacobs has received calls and messages from yet more staffers and their families, telling stories of being demeaned by their bosses.In November, Sarah Boseley and David Levene reported on how the Democratic Republic of Congo is stamping out sleeping sickness. the same month, the European Medicines Agency approved fexinidazole, the first simple oral pill for the disease that used to kill thousands and for which, until a decade ago, the main treatment was drugs derived from arsenic. It will transform prospects for those infected by the bite of the tsetse fly and could help eradicate the disease by the WHO target date of 2020. It’s a triumph for the Congolese doctors and their government programme, and for the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative.And what of our Blind Date couples? We ran some numbers on this year’s columns and found that the average dater scored their evening an impressive 7.93 out of 10. There were kisses shared on eight dates and six people awarded their date a perfect 10.We asked all our daters what happened next of those who replied, at least four couples made it to a second meeting. MA student Sophie and solicitor Emily’s date in July has blossomed into a full-blown romance. “We had a second date before the article was even published and have been seeing each other ever since,” Emily says. Meanwhile, illustrator Lizzie and book editor Tom gave each other full marks in May 2017 – and announced their engagement in April this year. “We are so grateful as we would never have met otherwise,” Lizzie says. “We’re very, very happy.” They have invited Nina Trickey, Weekend’s cupid, to the wedding.While other dates didn’t lead to love, they did have life-changing consequences. Both Laura, a digital marketing manager, and Richard, an employment lawyer, used their moment in the spotlight to come out of the closet. “I had a hugely positive response,” Richard says. “It lifted a massive burden from my shoulders. It’s one of the best things I’ve done.”Want to find love next year? Email blind.date@the• Commenting on this piece?

Photograph: Ray LohanThis award is claimed outright by a very special group of men and women who exist in a peculiar political limbo reserved for creatures known as Ministers of State.These poor souls yearn for full Cabinet status and live in constant hope that somebody in the Taoiseach’s first XIV will resign, get sacked or run over on Kildare Street by the 67 bus – sooner rather than later.A delegation of Ministers of State from outside the greater Dublin area met Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe this month and pleaded with him for more expenses as the cost of accommodation in the capital these days is astronomical.Under existing rules, a Minister of State receives a €94,535 salary as a TD and a ministerial payment of up to €35,319, pushing their earning power up to €129,854. They do not enjoy the same expenses regime as backbench TDs, and this rankles.Unfortunately, news of their tête-à-tête leaked and all the juniors got for their trouble was an overwhelming wave of derision from inside and outside Leinster House. Paschal sent them away with a flea in their ear.This one goes to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who, having survived a toe-curling meeting with a bored-looking Donald Trump in the Oval Office, set off for Capitol Hill for the traditional Speaker’s lunch and lost the run of himself during a speech in front of the president and members of Congress.Launching into an anecdote about a conversation he had when minister for tourism with then businessman Trump, Leo told how the man who would become president asked if he could do anything about the proposed building of wind farms near his newly purchased Doonbeg golf resort in Co Clare.He said he rang Clare County Council on his behalf.“I tried to do what I could do. The planning permission was declined . . . The president has very kindly given me credit for that. I have to say it probably would have been refused anyway,” he added, modestly.And a trip which should have been a success ended up with Leo insisting he did not try to influence the planning process while, back home, Opposition TDs bellowed for an inquiry.This award goes to Helen McEntee, Mairéad McGuinness and Verona Murphy who, on the Brexit front, have been playing a blinder in Europe, and more particularly, in the UK.McEntee, the Minister of State for Europe, has been growing in stature in Brussels as she bats for Ireland in negotiations and at media briefings. She is a very able stand-in for Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney when he can’t attend meetings. She has also handled media situations with bullish UK Brexiteers with understated authority.MEP McGuinness has been a rock of sense in a sea of confusion, misinformation and meat-headed ignorance, calmly stating the case for Ireland and the European Union as Brexiteering MPs and Anglocentric journalists wilfully try to misinterpret her plainly-put statements of truth. Her stock in Europe has never been so high.Wexford woman Murphy, head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, has become a much sought-after commentator about Brexit and its effects on business. Her impressive grasp of her brief and knowledge of the transport sector has left many Leave cheerleaders floundering. So it comes as no surprise to hear that the trucking expert, who puts the articulate into articulated, is currently being courted by the Fine Gael with a view to her running for the Dáil in the next election.Just one other thing. Is it absolutely necessary for Leo Varadkar to have Helen McEntee standing silently at his side during every photo-op in Brussels and at every impromptu doorstep interview? Is her seat in Meath so vulnerable that he has to do the Sinn Féin trick of pushing candidates into every TV shot and camera frame?This goes to Michael Lowry after his Long Walk to Freedom in June when he emerged from Dublin Circuit Criminal Court with a “fantastic result” after “22 years of turmoil”.The Independent TD for Tipperary and former minister for communications, who was excoriated by the Moriarty tribunal for his involvement when minister in the awarding of the State’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone consortium, left court in “a free man” with nothing but four convictions for tax offences against himself and his refrigeration company along with an overall €25,000 fine and a trifling three-year disqualification from acting as a company director.The runner-up in this category is Shane Ross, who had a run in with his constant tormentor Mattie McGrath in the Dáil canteen after McGrath had been giving him a tough time over his proposed drink-driving law.Mattie was having lunch with his daughter when Ross, aka Winston Churchtown, came tearing around the corner, shouting the odds.“You’re a bollocks. You’re a f***ing bollocks,” Winston told a startled McGrath in the course of an expletive-laden tirade. Winston then disappeared around the corner, only to re-emerge and start the name calling again.But the winner is journalist and anti-abortion activist John Waters, who took the hump during a podcast with Eamon Dunphy and stormed out of the studio.“Aaah, don’t go!” pleaded Dunphy as his guest departed having been asked to define when life begins.“This isn’t a fair interview! You’re a bollocks! You’re a f***ing bollocks! You can f*** off, Eamon! . . . Talk to Una Mullally. F*** off.”This goes to Ivana Bacik for her tireless work, stretching back to her student days, on the abortion campaign. And for her great energy in promoting Votáil 100, the centenary of womens’ suffrage.The winner here is Daily Mail journalist Joanna Bell, who was ejected from the Irish embassy in London last week for her drunken heckling of Ambassador Adrian O’Neill during a reception. Bell, originally from Dundalk, interrupted him as he spoke about the possibility of a second Brexit referendum.Afterwards, she contritely revealed that “a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat” was the reason for her “excessive robustness.”The eccentric aristocrat, by the way, is the Hon David Roper-Curzon, who is set to be Lord Teynham when his 90-year-old father dies.As she was being escorted down the stairs, Bell shouted: “This is because I am pro-Brexit.” Also on the stairs, but heading in the opposite direction, were Jeffrey and Mary Archer.Mrs Archer shouted after her: “I’m a Brexiteer and I’m not being asked to leave. This is about manners, not politics.”And then Jeffrey cried: “And I’m a Remainer!”No. Not the Pope. Francis delighted his many followers when he visited in September, but what was supposed to be the highlight of his trip – Mass in the Phoenix Park – was something of a damp squib due to rain and a low turnout.The award goes to Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan, who was the subject of one of the most unexpected political stories of the year when she was forced to go public and deny that she had celebrated Mass in her local parish church when the priest failed to turn up one Saturday evening.What actually happened is that she led a prayer service with fellow parishioners in the absence of a priest so that the congregation were able to worship, albeit in a different way, having made their way to church.And she got a rap on the knuckles from Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin, for her trouble.Committees are often overlooked, but certain TDs and senators put in a lot of hours and hard work at this unglamorous end of politics. The Public Accounts Committee is a different animal. It gets a lot of attention and, consequently, it is often used by grandstanding TDs to draw attention to themselves.Catherine Connolly, Independent TD for Galway, has been an outstanding performer at the PAC. She is calm, measured and incisive. She asks her questions and she gets her answers. Job done.If only others – yes, Marc MacSharry, we’re looking at you – could do the same.This one is being shared by Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and the Healy-Rae brothers. Rarely a day goes by in the Dáil without one of the four kicking up a stink about how rural Ireland is on its last legs, dying on its feet with its people broken and beaten down by “them above in Dublin”. They paint a pitiful situation of life beyond the Pale. If you were to spend too long listening to their bellyaching, you’d begin to wonder why anyone at all wants to live in rural Ireland.There is good and bad in rural and urban living. This forever complaining quartet, despite what its members might believe, doesn’t have the monopoly on bad luck stories in the Dáil Éireann.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is still marooned in the Seanad, months into the Upper House’s consideration of the Judicial Appointments Bill. Senators, particularly those with legal backgrounds, are holding up the progress of the Bill by tabling countless amendments and talking for Ireland.They are ably marshalled by senior counsel Michael McDowell, who is having a filibustering field day and enjoying every minute of it. He hasn’t looked so happy in years. What could make him happier? Word is that he would love a Dáil comeback.Meanwhile, Charlie must endure the meanderings with fortitude. It’s Winston Churchtown’s pet project, but he doesn’t have to listen to the senators droning on. Charlie has clocked up almost 70 hours of duty – it’s like he’s doing community service in the Seanad. The debate has reached section 38 of the Bill, and there are more than 60 to consider. And all the while the amendments fly in.Bród and Síoda.By popular acclaim, and a landslide victory, Michael D Higgins.This goes to Simon Harris for his achievement in leading a difficult abortion referendum campaign from the front, steering it to an overwhelming vote by the people to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution and overseeing the introduction of legislation to allow the provision of abortion services in Ireland. He was present in the Seanad on the night of December 13th, along with those who campaigned for decades for Irish women to have autonomy over their own bodies, when all stages of the Bill passed.The winners are Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. Despite being rivals for the party leadership last year, the two have worked together very well on the Brexit issue. They have presented a united front and remained steadfastly on message. Their sure-footedness and grasp of the issues is in marked contrast to the Brexit shambles lurching between crisis and farce across the water.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is the clear winner. From his surprising Dáil announcement in January that he was not only supporting the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment but was also in favour of the introduction of abortion within a 12-week time limit, to his decision to continue supporting the Government next year so it can be free to concentrate on Brexit issues, Micheál has put in a strong and principled performance in the thankless and difficult role of leader of the Opposition. He is also saddled with a parliamentary party team which is far from united, with some actively working to undermine his leadership.It may be that he knows he doesn’t have the numbers to come out on top if an election is called in the next 12 months, so stalling in the “national interest” isn’t such a bad idea. And while his decision to support the recommendations of both the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee on abortion was deeply opposed and resented by a large rump in the party, he emerged as the one most in tune with the will of the people.The decision to continue the confidence-and-supply arrangement with Fine Gael may backfire on him, and is very unpopular with many activists, but the public may take a different view and reward him for taking a noble stand at a time when Ireland faces potential grave national crisis."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The Herald Angels Sing\u0027 is incurring the ire of bishops because it removes the reference to Mary\u0027s virginity, with the line Offspring of a virgin\u0027s womb replaced with Offspring of the favoured one.Senior Church of England clergy have warned against using the altered version of Charles Wesley’s Christmas hymn, which has found its way into an increasing number of services.Revd Marcus Walker, rector of Great St Bartholomew in the City of London, said the text change was not heretical but it “plays down the Virgin Birth, plays down the reality of Christ\u0027s birth, and Mary\u0027s femininity – that he came out of a womb this was a real birth from a real woman.The bishop of Crediton, Bishop Jacqueline Searle, said sticking to the original text was vital “because it’s a part of our creed”.“It’s important that we are not squeamish about singing \u0027of a virgin’s womb\u0027, which reflects nothing being impossible with God,” she said.Bishop Searle added that there were different theological ways in which people understand the Virgin Birth today, but it was important that Christmas carols were not tampered with, because altered versions could mislead people less familiar with the Christian faith.“Just because something sounds difficult or new doesn’t mean it needs to be changed.“When we sing our doctrine, it is saying something about what we believe. Especially at this time of year, when lots of people are singing carols, we would like what we’re singing to reflect as accurately as we can the faith we inhabit.”The Bishop of Blackburn, Julian Henderson, also criticised the change, arguing that Wesley’s original “is an essential part of the Christmas story”.Donald Allister, the Bishop of Peterborough, added: “Wesley’s great Christmas carol conveys the true Christmas message joyfully and powerfully. It is a great shame to see any attempt to reduce that message.”Many carol texts have been modernised, reordered, or retranslated from foreign languages over the centuries, but usually without changing their message. Wesley’s original opening line to his carol was “Hark, how all the Welkin Rings”, “welkin” meaning sky or heavens.Recently the texts of some carols have been modified to use “inclusive language” rather than words such as “sons” or “men”.Rev Dr Ian Paul, a theologian and member of the Archbishops\u0027 Council, which oversees Church of England strategy and funding, said the altered version of the carol “avoids the awkward challenge of the Virgin Birth and probably ought to be put in the bin”, and advised anyone putting together a carol service to consult a good-quality printed hymnbook for their texts rather than just search online.A Google search links the changed version to American gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who recorded \u0027Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\u0027 in the 1960s, though the exact provenance of the altered line is unclear.Rupert Gough, who was directing the choristers after the banquet said: “I see this all the time at weddings – you Google for texts and you think ‘That’s it,’ and it may have come from an American site or whatever, and you find that people tinker with the words.”Andrew Reeves, head server and master of ceremonies at west London’s Holy Trinity church, Sloane Square, said he came across the altered words this week at a company carol service. Staff from the company had sourced the texts for the orders of service but when the congregation came to the unfamiliar line, “everybody was completely thrown,” he said.Church of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyPaedophile stripped of his British citizenship and facing deportation to IndiaGreater protection needed for endangered seas around South Sandwich IslandsIndonesia \u0026#39volcano tsunami\u0026#39: At least 168 dead and 745 injured after Krakatoa eruptsComment: Britain doesn\u0026#39t need a Chief Nanny.

People are looking to reduce their exposure and closing out high risk sell positions before the holidays and this is creating upward pressure on market prices, which is ultimately resulting in a rally.CoinMarketCap)The dramatic price gains come at the end of a disappointing year for Bitcoin, having traded at close to $20,000 (£15,850) in December 2017.The wildly fluctuating price is not unusual for the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, with five previous cycles seeing bitcoin fall by an average of 85 per cent each time.Before the latest recovery, the price of bitcoin was around 83 per cent down on its 2017 high.iStock)Opinion is ided over whether bitcoin will return to its previous highs, with some analysts suggesting that bitcoin will eventually become worthless.\u0026nbspOthers are more positive in their forecasts, including Mr McAfee, who famously predicted that one bitcoin will be worth $500,000 (£396,000)\u0026nbspin 2020.If not, I will eat my d**k on national television, he tweeted in July 2017.

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the withdrawal agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the international trade secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?Other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the cost-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.If we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s common external tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonisation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.Finally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But how could it look under a no-deal Brexit?Items that are grown in the UK won’t be affected, but those that are imported will become more costly as they will be subject to tariffs and other expensive trade barriers.Parsnips and carrots Let’s start with the good news. Parsnips and carrots are grown in abundance in the UK. They are available throughout most of the year and are rarely imported from abroad. So even a Brexit as hard as a raw parsnip is unlikely to affect this popular Christmas side dish.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPeople with the Brussels sprouts-hating TAS2R38 gene are out of luck. Brussels sprouts are so abundant in the UK that they are actually exported around the world. The topical Christmas cracker joke, “How will Christmas dinner be different after Brexit? No Brussels” is unlikely to be true for the actual vegetable.These are the least recyclable Christmas chocolate wrappersAlthough the UK is a major potato producer, some potatoes and potato products still get imported to meet UK demand. This mainly applies to frozen or processed potato products such as frozen fries. Due to a large harvest in 2016-17, the UK is expected to be a net exporter of fresh potatoes in 2017-18. Fresh potato imports have been predominantly from EU countries, but traditional suppliers such as France appear to have found other markets. UK fresh potato exports are predominantly to the EU (98 per cent).So as long as growing conditions are favourable, there ought to be sufficient fresh UK potatoes to roast for Christmases to come.It is thought that sweet chestnut trees were brought to Britain by the conquering Romans and, like many other immigrants, they have naturalised and become an important part of the food chain. In most years\u0026nbspthe nuts grow to a reasonable size in the south-east of England. But in other areas it is unusual for more than one of the fruits in each husk to reach full size. They are generally not harvested in time for Christmas, but can be preserved by boiling and freezing.The fresh chestnuts you see at Christmas in the UK are mostly sourced from elsewhere in Europe. This is because sweet chestnut trees in the UK are threatened by both fungal blight and, more recently, the oriental chestnut gall wasp.If having reasonably priced quality fresh sweet chestnut imports is important to you at Christmas, Brexit could be a problem.Created with Sketch.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.Cranberries provide a splash of colour at the Christmas table. They also make a good option for retaliatory tariffs against the US, the world’s largest cranberry producer. The EU took more than 50 per cent\u0026nbspof US cranberry exports in 2018, with the UK leading the way.That is not to say the UK does not have its own cranberries. The two native cranberry species in the UK are vaccinium oxycoccos (the northern cranberry) and vaccinium microcarpus (the small\u0026nbspcranberry). Wild harvesting used to take place in Scotland but, due to habitat loss, this is no longer done. As a consequence, the cranberries bought in UK stores are the species vaccinium macrocarpon. These are harvested in North America and Eastern Europe using a method that involves flooding the land, which is impractical in the UK.Vaccinium macrocarpon is also grown commercially on Terschelling, an island belonging to the Netherlands. The Netherlands is also a global trade centre for fresh fruit and vegetable imports and exported about €6m (£5.4m) worth of cranberries in 2017 (many of which were grown elsewhere).So the availability of cranberries in the UK is largely dependent on shipments from the EU. This supply chain arrangement may have to change after Brexit, particularly if the UK were to decide not to follow EU trade legislation. Depending on the flavour of Brexit, the costs of establishing a new supply chain independent of EU trade hubs and losing the economies of scale that the EU enjoys as a whole could lead to shortages initially and increased costs in the future.The majority of UK families opt for roast turkey on Christmas day. This will cost them more if there’s a hard Brexit.Turkeys are becoming more expensive to produce in the UK. Turkey producer Kelly Bronze’s prices, for example, are up by about 5.4 per cent\u0026nbspthis year and it has warned that a hard Brexit will affect its business by 70 per cent.A significant cost of producing turkeys in the UK is related to the labour cost of hand plucking. This relies on EU migrant labour and staffing for the Christmas peak and is a real concern. Brexit scenarios considered by farmers’ groups indicate that any deal affecting\u0026nbspthe labour pool is likely to lead to increased prices.For those not paying a premium for hand-plucked turkeys, any Brexit trade deals imposing tariffs or import restrictions on cheaper turkeys from the EU would not make them cheaper for the consumer. A trade deal with the US might provide the option of turkey meat marinated in chlorine – not necessarily to everyone’s taste.Strasbourg attack: Is it safe to visit Christmas markets in Europe?Elderly woman cuts down flashing Christmas lights in middle of nightCassetteboy remixes Die Hard to prove it’s a Christmas filmThe average number of turkeys slaughtered in the UK per week in December 2017 was half a million birds or about 2 million over the month. Allowing for the additional 1.6 million from November, the figure is still more than 6 million short of the estimated 10 million consumed at Christmas.Pigs in blankets The cost and availability of sausages wrapped in bacon is dependent on pork supplies. British farmers currently produce only 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60 per cent\u0026nbspcomes from EU countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.So, as with turkey, a hard Brexit would lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon due to either import costs or supply and demand issues.Christmas might only come once a year but Brexit is likely to make it even more expensive.Hana Trollman is a PhD researcher at Loughborough University.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”I can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A redesign sets out to show that to consumersClick to followThe IndependentWorkers at Suma in Elland, YorkshireWhen Sheree Hatton started working at the whole foods distributor Suma six years ago, she knew it was different to anywhere else she’d ever worked.Hatton lives in Halifax with her husband and young son. In her previous job in advertising and sales for a newspaper, she was\u0026nbspused to a hierarchical business with targets for workers. Suma,\u0026nbspa worker’s co-op where each employee owns a share of the business, offered her a chance to have a say in everything from overall strategy to day-to-day operations.\u0026nbspEating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Organic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I knew Suma was different from what I had been used to,” Hatton says. “But the more I learned about co-ops, the more I realised that by feeding into business decisions\u0026nbspyou have an equal opportunity to say how the business should be run.”Suma is known as the largest whole food distributor in the UK. But fewer people know that Suma is also Britain’s biggest workers co-operative, with an annual turnover of £55m. More than 200 people now work at Suma after rapid growth in the last few years.\u0026nbspAll of them are considered equal. Every worker at Suma is paid the same salary of £33,000. They get the opportunity to work in every part of the business – including the canteen kitchen – on rotation at the company offices in Elland, Yorkshire. And they get to vote on business decisions. “We are an equal business and we’re very proud of what we’re doing here,” Hatton says.\u0026nbspBut customers, like Hatton, often aren’t instantly aware of Suma’s co-operative status or what that means, according to a survey they commissioned in 2017. “One of the embarrassing points was that not everyone knew that we are a co-op,” Hatton says. So in 2017, Suma workers decided it was time for a rebrand.\u0026nbspPearlfisher (Courtesy Photo)Suma was started over 40 years ago in the kitchen of a house in Leeds. Reg Taylor, owner of a small retail shop, proposed at a meeting attended by other wholefood shops in the north of England that they set up a wholesaling co-operative, to supply to each other, in 1975.The name Suma was first used when the business moved to a lock-up garage in Leeds. In 1977, the business was sold to seven employees who became the founder members of the Triangle Wholefoods Collective Ltd, trading as Suma.Suma has recently benefited as consumers have become more conscious of their health and the ethics of food, plus the growing popularity of veganism. The business introduced its own vegan line in September 2017. New vegan products, including the 2018 introductions of meat-free mini-burgers in tins, have helped sales grow in the last decade.Suma now sells over 7,000 products. The branding has evolved\u0026nbsphaphazardly as lines have been added. Workers knew from customer feedback that they needed a redesign to create a single identity across all ranges, including essential, body and home. Designers also wanted to position Suma at the forefront of the new movement for sustainability and contemporary food.“We really wanted to show off that it was a co-op,” says Harriet Ferguson, senior designer at Pearlfisher, the agency commissioned to do the work. “The existing identity didn’t really do that.” Pearlfisher designers added a tagline to the logo\u0026nbsp“Co-op since 1977” to make Suma distinctive against competition against younger brands. Then they designed a logo out of different shapes to show the different personalities in the co-op.“We called this our Suma of parts and used these shapes to create the logo type. This\u0026nbspdynamic pattern can be used on the packaging at\u0026nbspdifferent levels,” Ferguson says.Suma’s inhouse design team picked some of the trickiest products for Pearlfisher to work on in the redesign, including fiddly products with small labels, like pate tubes, and some that didn’t obviously fit into one range, like coconut products.Pearlfisher turned their designs into a set of packs for Suma’s inhouse designers to roll out across old and new lines. The agency also introduced colour palettes to make different products more identifiable. They used earthy tones for the basic products, simple colours for unprocessed food and bright, natural colours for processed pastas and peanut butter. For the premium products, like speciality coffee, they used a charcoal colour palette with pops of colour.The most important thing, says David Jenkinson, creative designer at Pearlfisher, was creating a sense of the collective in all the elements. “The new identity embodies the idea that this is a collective of iniduals,” he says. “They are aligned, they sing from the same hymn sheet, but they are different.”The new\u0026nbspcolourful logo, with its tessellating shapes, will be seen on lorries up and down the country and on tins and tubes of Suma products in wholefood stockists\u0026nbspfrom January.\u0026nbspWhole Foods releases its 2019 list of new food trendsA key part of Hatton’s job has been communicating the new design to staff internally. In a company where 200 people can vote on every small change, Suma needed a process to make sure the redesign wasn’t delayed by disagreements. “We didn’t want 200 people deciding what colours to use!” says Hatton. Instead the branding team built a case for the rebrand and wrote a business plan. They took the plan to workers, who voted it through. Then the designers were free to make decisions, with in-house work making sure workers were happy with the results.“It’s probably been a little slower, just generally because we’re trying to get consensus and make sure people are behind everything before we proceed,” Hatton says. Some longstanding members wanted to stick with the existing designs, because they saw that it had worked. Hatton and other Suma members listened to them and tried to alleviate any concerns. “In a typical commercial industry people just get told what is happening,” she says. “The difference is that we want people to be passionate about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film.

PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. Disney pulled it out of the bag once again with this tale of\u0026nbspa world run by animals,\u0026nbspin which a bunny (Ginnifer Goodwin) attempts to break out of her rural roots to become a city cop.\u0026nbspOne of the best animations of the decade.\u0026nbspHaving time off work over Christmas provides you with time to catch up with the classics you might not have seen. Start with Rear Window, the Alfred Hitchcock thriller following a housebound photographer who becomes convinced his neighbour has murdered his wife.Gremlins may have seemed like a risky experiment (it’s a creature feature Christmas horror comedy, after all), but it’s one that paid off. When a teenager is given a cute new pet named Gizmo, he’s instructed to follow a set of three rules, which he swiftly breaks. You know the rest...Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Channel 5, 1.05pmIf you’ve not seen this musical – which features a standout performance from screen legend Howard Keel, and deserves as much love as Stanley Donen’s other classic, Singin’ in the Rain – this Christmas is the time to\u0026nbsprectify that oversight.\u0026nbspThe BBC’s big premiere is Disney’s live-action remake of The Jungle Book, which was released to acclaim back in 2016. Director Jon Favreau (Iron Man) did such a good job, the studio handed him the reins for a similar\u0026nbspLion King remake,\u0026nbspwhich will be released in cinemas in the summer of 2019.Naming your favourite Pixar film is an increasingly difficult task, but Monsters, Inc should always be in contention. In it, monster\u0026nbspduo Sulley and Mike Wazowski (brilliantly voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) live in a city fuelled by children’s screams, which is turned upside down by the arrival of a young girl named Boo.Song of the Sea, Channel 4, 5.40amThis little-seen fantasy film, an Irish co-production, charts the journey of a young boy who discovers that his mute sister is a mythical\u0026nbspselkie. The beautiful hand-drawn animation alone makes it\u0026nbspworth your time.Raiders of the Lost Ark, BBC1, 1.25pmAs is Christmas norm, the BBC will show the original Indiana Jones trilogy over three consecutive nights. Apologies to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but there’s no denying the franchise\u0026nbsppeaked with its debut – an adventure film unlike any in existence.Saving Mr Banks is a worthy watch if only for the on-screen chemistry between Emma Thompson – here starring as Mary Poppins creator, PL Travers – and Tom Hanks who plays the man responsible for bringing the character\u0026nbspto screen: Walt Disney. John Lee Hancock’s film brings the emotion (all together now) in the most delightful waaaay.The Pirates! In An Adventure with Scientists!, BBC1, 9.25amCast-iron proof that Aardman Animation is every bit as good as\u0026nbspPixar and DreamWorks. This feature takes viewers to the high seas for an adventure centred on Hugh Grant’s kooky captain.Bond 23 may be patchy, but it features several highlights, namely Javier Bardem’s genuinely eerie bad guy. The thrilling opening sequence is\u0026nbspone of the most memorable in 007 history.Jimi: All Is by My Side, BBC2, 12.50amThis music drama was a festival favourite upon its release in 2013. Written by 12 Years a Slave scribe John Ridley, it charts the beginning of Jimi Hendrix’s career, weighted by an impressive lead performance from Outkast’s André Benjamin.\u0026nbspPerhaps the most entertaining Jane Austen adaptation there is. Gwyneth Paltrow leads the troupe as the eponymous character who plays matchmaker in her small community in 19th-century England. Toni Collette and Ewan McGregor also star.Whether you’ve recently seen its new sequel or you’re planning a cinema trip before the new year, Wreck-It Ralph is undoubtedly worth your time. The voice work of John C Reilly and Sarah Silverman – who plays video game character Vanelloppe von Schweetz – is Disney’s most compelling since Goodman and Crystal’s in Monsters, Inc.Watched Rear Window the other day? Now it’s time to tick another Hitchcock classic off the list (or re-watch it for the hundredth time). This regular fixture at the top of “Best of...” lists demands to be devoured.If it seems like\u0026nbspGroundhog Day’s on television at the same time every year, that’s probably the point. Harold Ramis’s seminal comedy – starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell – is as charming now as it was upon its release 25 years ago.\u0026nbspIf you find the Marvel Cinematic Universe slightly impenetrable, but are on the hunt for an undemanding way in, Ant-Man‘s the film for you. Starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas, it’s a film that can be enjoyed by all the family, regardless of whether you like superheroes or not.You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll cheer in this incredible adaptation, which charts the journey of an Irish woman (Dame Judi Dench) searching for her\u0026nbspson, who was\u0026nbsptaken away by nuns at birth. Steve Coogan, who plays the real-life journalist helping her on her way, co-wrote the Oscar-winning script.While Paddington 2 may still have a 100 per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes, don’t go forgetting that its predecessor was equally as glorious. Paul King brilliantly captures the spirit of Michael Bond’s beloved bear, who finds himself taken in by a kindly family in London after straying from his home turf of Peru.It’s been a rough year for the Star Wars saga, with disappointing box office takings for its second spin-off, Solo. However, The Force Awakens remains a glistening jewel that blends the old and new eras effortlessly, thanks to the capable direction of JJ Abrams.John Michael McDonagh – brother of Three Billboards writer-director Martin McDonagh – followed up his razor-sharp directorial debut The Guard with this shocking murder mystery of sorts. it follows Brendan Gleeson’s priest who is warned, in confession by an unknown member of his congregation, that he’ll\u0026nbspbe killed in a week’s time.Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence.

And I love him and that – I don’t blame him. But I was angry, and I got into trouble,” he says.“I had the Old Bill round my gaff every five minutes. I was a wrong ’un. No one knew how to help me. Then I found a father figure I didn’t even know I needed.“I went for an audition for a play and I met this old geezer who wrote it. He was an East Ender, he was a West Ham fan just like me. He thought I was alright and he gave me the part. Turns out it was a fella called Harold Pinter.“He became the most influential man in my life… He taught me that where I came from didn’t dictate where I went to.”He goes on to add: “Life can get a little stressful and we might get on each other’s nerves a bit, but remember how much there is to be proud of, to be grateful of, and get yourself a Harold, you know, if you can … Merry Christmas, my loves.”Danny Dyer’s Alternative Christmas Message airs on Christmas Day at 3.50pm on Channel 4Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Quentin Crisp, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Brigitte Bardot, Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox have all given past speeches.Dyer provided one of the TV highlights of the year\u0026nbspin June when he appeared on ITV’s Good Evening Britain -\u0026nbspas part of a surreal panel also including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Baywatch star Pamela Anderson – and launched into an impassioned rant against Brexit and former prime minister David Cameron.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Who knows about Brexit? No one has got a fucking clue what Brexit is, yeah. You watch Question Time, it’s comedy”, he said. “No one knows what it is – it’s like this mad riddle that no one knows what it is, right?“So what’s happened to that twat David Cameron who called it on?”, he continued, gathering momentum.Danny Dyer to deliver alternative Christmas message on Channel 4“Where is he? He’s in Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?\u0026nbspI think he should be held to account for it.\u0026nbspTwat.”In November, Dyer continued his diatribe against the British political class and the “age of food banks”\u0026nbspin The Big Issue.“Theresa May, bless her, just got that job by default,” he told the magazine. “Boris Johnson running around with his stupid haircut, spouting bollocks. Young people look and think: ‘If these are the people running the country, why shouldn’t I just go and loot and riot?’”“Politicians are just floundering around. They have been given this thing called fucking Brexit because of one man. One man. Who we voted in to be our prime minister, who purely for his own ego decided to call a referendum just to get rid of Nigel Farage.“Well, fuck you\u0026nbspCameron, you posh twat. Sorry. It backfired on him, didn’t it? And what does he do? He fucks off. He doesn’t like the way it went and he fucks off.”The Londoner’s plainspeaking on TV and on Twitter has made him a folk hero over the years and his vitriol on Brexit\u0026nbspsaw him become an immediate fixture in Cold War Steve’s satirical photomontages on Twitter, as high an honour as 2018 had to offer.Dyer – who first rose to fame starring in low-budget Cockney gangster films and as host of Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men -\u0026nbspwill also address American politics in his Christmas Day broadcast, describing Donald Trump as an “absolute melt”. He previously asked his Twitter followers:\u0026nbsp“Is it me or is this geezer completely off his strange-looking nut?”One of his most famous tweets of all concerned events across the pond in 2012:\u0026nbsp“Can’t believe it’s nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the Twin Towers. It still freaks my nut\u0026nbspout to this day.”As for the Queen, his rival for viewing figures on 25 December, Dyer is actually distantly related to her, as we learnt from a memorable 2016 instalment of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are?, which traced his East End roots back to the Tudor epoch and Edward III, a revelation he was stunned by.“I think I’m going to treat myself to a ruff… Just get a massive ruff, just bowl about with it and if anyone questions it then I’ll explain to them why I’m wearing a ruff,” he said, rather touchingly.\u0026nbspWishing the Queen a happy 90th birthday on an episode of ITV’s Celebrity Juice, he said: “You probably ain’t got a clue who I am… Go out tonight and get off your fucking nut. Enjoy yourself!”The author of The World According to Danny Dyer (2015) has done some of his very best work on social media, routinely dishing out deathless wisdom in his signature style: “I hate that early bird. You know, the one who catches the worm. Get back in ya nest ya feathery little mug.”On Christmas, he posted in 2013:\u0026nbsp“Just whacked me tree up. It’s looking slightly camp this year.\u0026nbspCan’t work out how to give it a pair of bollocks.”On pubs:\u0026nbsp”You’re going in for a drink and a laugh with your mates.

It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”What frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your

First, there isn’t going to be a New Year election and, even if\u0026nbspMr Corbyn was in charge, Brussels would still demand the same “backstop”\u0026nbspto protect the Irish border in the orce agreement.Either his understanding of the Brexit impasse doesn’t extend beyond key stage one level or he is guilty of the same charge he levels at Theresa May – of running down the clock, rather than making hard choices.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal BrexitLabour’s Brexit policy, such as it is, is set out in the “composite motion” agreed after many hours of agonised bargaining by more than 200 people at the party’s conference in September.It vows to defeat the prime minister’s deal and then “support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote” should Labour not be able to secure a general election.All clear? No, of course not – because, in the three months since, Mr Corbyn has never set out what the other “options” might be, beyond his support for a permanent customs union.Most political observers believe there are three crashing out of the EU with no deal, softer ‘Norway-style’ exit terms (but with the backstop) and a Final Say referendum.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Looks shocking on the film, unacceptable in any environment.”However, shortly after prime minister’s questions, Mr Corbyn’s spokesman denied the allegation, insisting: “He did not call her a ‘stupid woman’. So I don’t think there is a basis for an apology. As I understand it he said ‘stupid people’.”The spokesman told reporters: “Lip reading in such circumstances is always open to doubt.”As tempers flared, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, said he did not see or hear the alleged remark, but made clear: “Is that language unacceptable? Yes.”He also urged Mr Corbyn “to return to the chamber” to hear his verdict on what happened later this afternoon, after watching the TV footage.Corbyn\u0027s barely there leadership could lead to mutiny – againLabour \u0027would fall behind Lib Dems\u0027 if Corbyn backs May\u0027s Brexit dealJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027In a BBC TV studio, Barry Gardiner, a Labour frontbencher and Corbyn ally, said he was “not a lipreader” but agreed it appeared that Mr Corbyn had said “stupid woman”.The row blew up after Ms May likened Mr Corbyn’s attempt to force a confidence vote in her earlier this week to a Christmas pantomime – accusing him of dithering.First he said he would call a no confidence vote, Then he said he wouldn’t. Then he did, but it was not effective. “Oh yes he will, oh no he won’t,” she taunted – saying the Labour leader should “look behind him” at his own despairing MPs.But Mr Corbyn hit back, saying it was the prime minister’s job to deliver the negotiation and, if she was incapable of doing so, she should step aside for someone who can.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereVote of no confidenceOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He has been under house arrest for the last 16 monthsFor two days last week, audiences at\u0026nbspMoscow’s Gogol Centre theatre were served up an age-old question: “Just who in Russia has a happy life?”In common with the rest of the theatre’s repertoire, Nikolai Nekrasov’s 1869 classic came with a bohemian workaround. The 2018 version had rap music, contemporary dance scenes, sex and fairly gratuitous nudity. But the gist of the tale remained the same: seven peasants traipsing across the largest country on earth, all in search of just one happy Russian.\u0026nbspThe men move from priest to boyar, labourer to bureaucrat, men to women. Along the way, they are hindered by Russia: by incarceration, corruption, violence and vodka.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialEventually, they conclude no one is really happy or free. Only, perhaps, the tsar has it good. And even then, no one is sure.\u0026nbspThe contemporary resonance of Nekrasov’s epic will have been lost on few in the audience. No one will have\u0026nbspneeded to see the cast’s “Freedom to the director!” T-shirts, revealed on final curtain, to know one important member of the production was missing.\u0026nbspOr that the man, the virtuoso director Kirill Serebrennikov, was at home under house arrest, as he has been for the last sixteenth months.\u0026nbspRussian theatre director detained on embezzlement chargeSerebrennikov is one of four people who stand\u0026nbspaccused of forming a “crime syndicate”, defrauding\u0026nbspthe Russian state to the tune of\u0026nbsp133m rubles (£1.5m). The charges relate to a grant awarded by then-president Dmitry Medvedev to develop experimental theatre.Serebrennikov and his co-defendants deny all the charges, and have described them as “absurd”.While the\u0026nbsptheatre world occasionally cuts corners with tax and cash payments,\u0026nbspfew believe the director’s problems are at all down to money. With provocative productions that touched on many taboo subjects such as homosexuality, Serebrennikov had, after all, created powerful enemies in the conservative elite.\u0026nbspFor many, the trial has become\u0026nbspno less than a test of creative freedom in Russia.\u0026nbspAt the very least, it is a test of creativity in the state prosecutor’s office. Less than 0.1 per cent\u0026nbspof all trials that reach court in Russia end with acquittals. And so far, there is little evidence\u0026nbspthis case will buck the trend, with proceedings\u0026nbspoccasionally\u0026nbspbordering\u0026nbspon the absurd.\u0026nbspInitially, Serebrennikov and his co-accused stood accused of taking money for a play that supposedly\u0026nbspnever made it to the stage. Defence lawyers pointed out A Midsummer Night’s Dream\u0026nbspwas not only staged but actually received theatre awards.\u0026nbsp‘Banned’ Russian ballet about gay Soviet dancer finally premieresRussia bans The Death of Stalin in first for post-Soviet eraThis week, investigators presented several new tomes of “evidence” –\u0026nbspinvoices, all supposedly signed by Serebrennikov’s co-defendant, Alexei Malobrodsky. The vast majority of these\u0026nbspdocuments bore no relation to the charges.\u0026nbspMost were innocuous phone bills, and electricity statements. But a\u0026nbspsubstantial number of the documents also contained\u0026nbspforged signatures.Over the course of an hour, Malobrodsky and his lawyers attempted to raise objections with the presiding judge.\u0026nbsp“This is not my signature, your honour,”\u0026nbspMalobrodsky said. “These documents are forged and should not be considered.”\u0026nbspAt one point, Malobrodsky’s lawyer,\u0026nbspKseniya Karpinskaya, called for the state prosecutor Oleg Lavrov to be removed from the case. Presenting false and tendentious\u0026nbspevidence, she argued, showed he had no interest in the objectivity of his case.\u0026nbspJudge Irina Akkuratova promised to retire\u0026nbspconsider the request. Three minutes later, she\u0026nbspreturned\u0026nbspwith a decision that surprised no one.\u0026nbsp“The judge does not see any basis for the claim,” she said. \u0026nbspSpeaking with The Independent outside the courtroom, the lawyer Karpinskaya said the evidence presented by the state prosecution\u0026nbspwas “highly irregular”, and proved nothing:\u0026nbsp“Maybe they haven’t made a decision yet about where they are taking the case. But the danger is that when we reach the end of the process, the judge will have forgotten that it’s all junk.”\u0026nbspAlready, the trial has come at considerable cost to the defendants and their families.\u0026nbspSerebrennikov, an only child, was this year unable to be by his dying mother’s side. His father, too, is currently suffering ill health, and is isolated from his son,\u0026nbspseveral hundred miles away in Rostov.\u0026nbspKirill Serebrennikov\u0027 film, shot by two film institute students,\u0026nbspreveals a message \u0027Russia, what do you want from me?\u0027\u0026nbsp(Oliver Carroll)Alexei Malobrodsky meanwhile saw his health deteriorate significantly during a year of pre-trial detention. He suffered a suspected heart attack in May, and only afterwards was released from detention. Last week, the trial was interrupted several times following another heart\u0026nbspscare, and he remains under close medical supervision.\u0026nbspKarpinskaya says her client’s pre-trial detention was clearly “disproportionate,” and used to push him to give evidence against Serebrennikov, the only real\u0026nbsptarget\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthe prosecution.\u0026nbsp“Someone had\u0026nbspit in for\u0026nbspSerebrennikov,” she says. “I can’t say who and why, though I have my suspicions. The other defendants are simply collateral.” \u0026nbspThe resources being thrown at the case\u0026nbspbear little correlation to the alleged sums involved. There are many theories — but little light — about who could\u0026nbspbe the driving force\u0026nbspbehind the prosecution. Might it\u0026nbsprepresent an attack on Vladislav Surkov, the once-all-powerful presidential aide and a prominent Serebrennikov backer? Was Vladimir Medinsky, the ultra-conservative culture minister somehow involved? Could Tikhon\u0026nbspShevkunov, Putin’s “personal\u0026nbspconfessor” be scheming?\u0026nbspThe only man who matters, Vladimir Putin, has made several contradictory statements on the case. At one point, he called investigators “fools”, before later suggesting\u0026nbsp“serious economic crimes” had been committed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne thing seems certain: The trial has become unusually sensitive for the Russian political system.\u0026nbspEarlier this month, two students in Russia’s leading film school were threatened with expulsion after they began\u0026nbspmaking a film about\u0026nbspGogol\u0026nbspCentre and the Serebrennikov\u0026nbspaffair.\u0026nbspDirector Artyom Firsanov told The Independent\u0026nbspthe school’s management subjected him to\u0026nbspseveral hours of intense questioning. They asked him to stop filming and\u0026nbspwithdrew permission to use the school’s facilities –\u0026nbspallegedly\u0026nbspafter receiving a call “from above”.\u0026nbspShooting for Being Kirill Serebrennikov continued nonetheless in a hastily rearranged studio located in a suburban shopping centre.\u0026nbspOver the course of a day, more than fifty people turned up to deliver short pieces to camera.\u0026nbspSome employed song, while others appeared with paintings\u0026nbspof the absent\u0026nbspdirector.\u0026nbspThe last participant stood simply, with his back to the camera, before removing his t-shirt to reveal a message written across his shoulders.\u0026nbsp“Russia, what do you want from me?” it read.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Yet all too often, their needs are ignored.My own family started as blacksmiths in Uttoxeter, Staffs.In , my father, Joseph Cyril Bamford, rented a lock-up garage for  shillings a week.He developed Europe’s first hydraulic tipping trailer for use by local farmers — and then, in , the backhoe loader, the classic JCB digger.JCB — JC Bamford Excavators Ltd — has produced more than a million machines.We have a turnover of more than £billion and factories around the world.Yet we remain a proud ­family business, headquartered in the Midlands and employing thousands of people there.Ours is not a unique success story. Yet it is rarer than it should be.Our main factory in Staffs used to be surrounded by thriving family manufacturers, mostly in the Black Country, Birmingham and Manchester.Over the decades, they have disappeared — because of tax regimes that made it impossible to pass firms on, or takeovers that stripped away what was special about the company, or government mandarins who thought they knew better what industry needed.In Germany, their world-class manufacturing sector thrives because they champion family firms, not least via tax breaks that make it normal for ownership to move across generations.In Britain, the tax system pushes entrepreneurs to sell up, and family businesses find it harder to get finance.No wonder that fewer than  per cent expect to keep their firm in the family.Yet we at JCB still have many excellent family firms among our suppliers — and our customers.In manufacturing, there are more than a quarter of a million family companies, employing more than a million people in jobs that add real value to the community.And such firms are found in every sector of the economy, not just ours.A company such as JCB is big enough to stand up for, and speak for, itself.But too many small firms do not get a hearing in government.Despite the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises — SMEs — are creating almost three times as many jobs as larger firms, it is the voice of the giants that dominates.Yes, these large firms contribute enormously to the economy, but they tend to be the most comfortable with the status quo.They might moan about regulation but they can afford to deal with it, knowing that it deters their smaller competitors.They see Brexit, for example, in terms of costs, rather than opportunities. This is reflected in government.Theresa May’s approach to Brexit was safety-first, focusing on protecting the cross-border supply chains of the multi-nationals.Yet  per cent of British firms do not export. Their main worries are to do with competition and regulation.But regulation, in particular, is harder to addresswe are still following European rules — as is striking new trade deals.Protecting the big companies means reducing opportunities for little ones.I voted, proudly and publicly, for Leave.I believe there is nothing to fear in trading on World Trade Organisation terms, as we at JCB already do — exporting to, and importing from, dozens of countries around the world.But this is not about Brexit. Millions of business owners throughout the country feel they are not represented or spoken for.Polling by Deltapoll recently found that even Tory voters do not think their party is on the side of small business.For the politicians who listen to these firms, the rewards will be political as well as economic.I have spent my le working in a family business.I believe family businesses, of all sizes, are tied to and invested in their communities in a way other firms can never be.And I worry that Britain has a model of tax, regulation and politics in which everything is arranged to suit the big firms on the FTSE, not those that might one day hope to replace them.Whatever the outcome of the Brexit wrangling, we can only succeed long termwe make Britain the best place in the world to start, run and keep a business of your own.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

above all  is a sign that the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party are prepared to back her Brexit deal.“Without the DUP, they haven’t got a chance of passing it,” warns one Cabinet minister.What, then, do the DUP need to come on board One Secretary of State who has kept open lines of communication with them, tells me that “by grim necessity, they will need something more than cosmetic concessions to vote for the deal”.This minister explains that “the DUP want a bankable reassurance that the backstop won’t be permanent and that there won’t be progressive ergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.The good news for Theresa May is that, according to one of those intimately involved in the negotiations, “the DUP want to sort things out”.“Relations between the leadership and the DUP had been in the deep freeze, they are somewhat better,” one Cabinet minister tells me.Adding that “the carelessness with which some of the principals have been treated has been repaired”.But the bad news for Theresa May is that the changes they want are signicant — and the EU aren’t going to offer them up straight away.The only way to get these changes might be to have Parliament vote for them and tell the EU that this is how the deal can get through and seethey are prepared to cooperate, or whether they’ll crash the entire Brexit negotiation over these additions.But one senior Cabinet minister laments that “Number  is miles away from being in that position”.This Secretary of State is adamant that they are “going to have to move”.Intriguingly, I am told the Irish have, via diplomatic back channels, communicated that one of the reasons they wouldn’t give May what she wanted at last week’s European Council was that they weren’t certain that what she was asking for would satisfy the DUP.I understand that privately senior Irish figures have been making clear thatthey knew precisely what the DUP wanted, they could then engage with that.I am told the Government will devote the dog days between Christmas and New Year to exploring what the DUP will accept, and what the EU can give.Getting the DUP back on board is vital for May because without that there is no chance of reducing the Tory rebellion down to a manageable size.The Tory machine is having a bit of success in whittling down the numbers against May’s deal.One hardcore Brexiteer admits that some backbench rebels “will go a bit soft”.But this sht is not yet anywhere near big enough to save May’s deal.Some in Cabinet are pinning their hopes on “people coming back after Christmas more pragmatic and less militant”.But one of those who has been trying to reduce the rebellion wearily remarks, “I don’t see much evidence of that.”The person who in Parliament, perhaps, knows the Tory Party best tells me that the equation is this: “If they get a legally binding codicil on the backstop, they’ll get it through.If they don’t, they won’t.”Over to you, Mrs May.A TORY MP is already telling colleagues that he has submitted his letter calling for a no-confidence vote in Theresa May next December.It is another reminder that the leadership issue isn’t going to go away.One loyalist Cabinet minister argues thatMay makes it through Brexit, she should then announce the timetable for her departure at conference next year.Having said when she’s off would probably be enough to prevent a confidence vote next December and allow her to leave with some dignity.May, though, is unlikely to bite on this idea.She is extremely resistant to boxing herself in on a departure date.The confidence vote has won May some time.But she won’t make next Decembershe interprets the result as a licence to carry on as before.One senior party figure is already complaining that she’s “not prepared to make the personnel changes that would help her own position”.While one figure inside the Government machine fumes that “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing in Number  and that is causing havoc for the rest of us”.Meanwhile, ambitious Cabinet ministers are continuing to lay the ground for their leadership bids.But as one Secretary of State points out, “It is normally the manner and nature of the departure that determines the successor” which is one of the reasons why the coming Tory leadership race will be the most unpredictable contest in living memory.THE Tory rage at Jeremy Corbyn over his alleged “stupid woman” comment at Prime Minister’s Questions was fuelled by a sense that the Speaker John Bercow is biased against them.As Anna Soubry, who is normally infuriating her fellow Tories by calling for a second referendum, pointed out: If it had been a Tory man who had apparently said it about a Labour woman, Bercow would have been all over it.In recent months, senior Labour figures have openly admitted that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to the allegations of bullying against Bercow because they think he’ll help them on Brexit.This is an untenable position – it is like a team keeping a referee on the pitch because they think he’ll give them a penalty in injury time.As Wednesday showed, we are dangerously close to the Tory side of the chamber simply not accepting Bercow’s authority.One senior Tory backbencher, who has defended the Speaker in the past, tells me “it felt like an insurrection”.The tragedy of Bercow’s speakership is that once gone, the chair’s reputation for impartiality will be almost impossible to restore.MPs will never again trust in the neutrality of the Speaker as they once did.THERESA MAY is planning a New Year charm offensive as she tries to persuade Tory MPs to back her Brexit deal.All of them – and their spouses – have been invited to a party in Downing Street in the week of January , which is when the Commons debate on her deal resumes.The implicit message is clear: If the Government falls over Brexit and the Tories tear themselves apart over the issue, then there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time.Whether this is enough to win round any wavering Tory MPs remains to be seen.It is going to take more than a few drinks to make the hardcore Brexiteers swallow their objections to the backstop.EvenTheresa May can win the big vote on her Brexit deal, she won’t be home and dry.Once the vote is won, the withdrawal agreement will have to be turned into law.This will provide plenty of opportunities for guerrilla warfare in Parliament.Cabinet ministers are particularly worried that rebels might put down an amendment making the payment of the £billion orce bill conditional on progress in the trade talks.If that passed, the EU would say that the UK hasn’t ratied the agreement and so there was no deal.Our journalists strive

We have minds of our own, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions.The reappearance of naked prejudice on the terraces can’t be blamed on anyone other than the racists themselves — and the other fans who stay silent instead of calling out the racists.These people should be named and shamed. Social media could be put to good use by posting a rogues’ gallery on every  and the faces of the bigots should be prominent, so that their wives, mothers and children can see what they’ve done. Roll on #stampoutracism.But the mystery is why there is an upsurge in such incidents right now.I, for one, thought that with the determined efforts of the clubs, led by the Kick It Out campaign, such scenes would cease. But I should have known better. Back in the early Seventies I lived ten minutes from Stamford Bridge — but I never went to home games.When it became fashionable to throw darts at our own fans, a black face standing in the Shed was nothing less than a walking bullseye.By the mid-Nineties I hoped it would be OK to bring my seven-year-old daughter and her pals to a game.Surely, there could be no danger in seats below the directors’ boxes, away from the common herd It took  minutes for me to learn the truth as two men in front of us leapt up to abuse the Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Carlton Palmer, screaming “You lanky-legged black ****”.I tapped one on the shoulder. He looked around, saw my face, and immediately apologised profusely. But the damage was done.Three weeks later, I attended a dinner at the City of London’s most glittering venue, the Guildhall.Suddenly, I found myself confronted by a familiar face — one of the same two men who had sat in the stand in front of us.A true racist, yet here he was, suave, suited and booted, at the heart of the British establishment. So much for the idea that all racists are ignorant, lower-class idiots.So what’s happened It seems bizarre that the Premier League, dominated by foreign players, many of them black, should still suffer from prejudice.And with top teams regularly playing in Europe, plus a successful England team nearly half of whose members are black or mixed race it’s hard to see why fans should start throwing bananas on the pitch again.But the truth is that many of the factors that drove racism on the terraces have never gone away, and have never been challenged effectively. Yes, recent political arguments about the EU and about immigration have allowed some of the scumbags who the game thought it had chased away to resurface with renewed bravado.It’s also possible that the increase in the number of fans from Eastern Europe, where attitudes to ersity are decidedly less tolerant, may have had an effect.Perhaps some of the brilliant players from Europe who now grace the English game might put themselves in the front line of their re-education.Butthe game wants to stamp out racism for good it needs to take a long, hard look at itself.In the Premier League, around one in five players are black.The number of black owners and coaches is negligible. This is sending out the worst message imaginable.I welcome the advent of great players like N’Golo Kante, Romelu Lukaku, and Dele Alli. But this is a sport owned and run almost exclusively by white men, who buy and sell black men at will.Yes, of  course, the heaviest weight that the players have to lt is their own multimillion-pound pay packets, so I don’t seek sympathy for them.But basically, football looks like the th-century plantation economy of the American South.It’s time for the game to start taking steps to make sure that its owners, their boards of directors and their executive and coaching staff look more like modern Britain.Arsenal v BurnleyAFC Bournemouth v BrightonCha v Leicester CityHuddersfield Town v SouthamptonManchester City v Crystal PalaceNewcastle United v FulhamWest Ham United v WatfordCardf City v Manchester UnitedIf the people at the top of the game seem to think that it’s OK to treat black people like field slaves, why would they expect the fans to treat the players with respect I saw my first game — Arsenal vs Leicester City — at the old Highbury ground.My dad wanted me to see his hero, the great inside-left George Eastham, in action.He realised that I was too small to see over the parapet, so we took the biggest book we had in the house for me to stand on. I watched Eastham while standing on Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the bestselling anti-slavery novel that had touched off the American Civil War.Maybe every owner needs to be sent a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book to remind our contemporary plantation bosses that it’s time for them too to confront the bigotry written into the game’s soul.Football’s racism hasn’t gone away, and it never will until we all look at its evil full in the face.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This lets them, and our country, down.The SNP also attacked Mr Corbyn, with Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling him the midwe to the delivery of the Torys Brexit plans.Blackford said: Jeremy Corbyn has finally come off the fence hes been sat on for the past two years.But unfathomably hes come down on the same side as Theresa May.The Labour party is incapable of providing opposition to the worst UK government that most people can remember.Lib Dem leader Vince Cable added that Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off.He added: He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.On Brexit, you simply cannot put a cigarette paper between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.The Labour chief was rated below Iain Duncan Smith, William Hague and Neil Kinnock after  months in the job."},{"url":null,"title":"surrogate mum abort baby parents birth defects","story":"One year on Stephanie Levesque has spoken out about her mourning and heartbreak after the little boy was taken away from her just moments after he was born.On December ,  the three-time surrogate mum gave birth to the boy - whose name she doesnt know - in Dallas, Texas.In the th week of her pregnancy it was revealed the baby, who she has named Luca, had a serious heart defect which could require surgery, but she is against abortion and says she was surprised at the request from the parents.Stephanie, a real estate agent from Texas, and her biological twin daughters heard a strong heartbeat at scans throughout the pregnancy and believed the baby would be born healthy.But when it came to the birth, Stephanie got a mere glance at the boy before he was taken away by the parents - she doesnt even knowhe went straight to have surgery.This is unlike her previous two surrogate births, as she is still very close to families and children and called the experiences the most beautul gt there is.Stephanie now wants to speak out about her experience a year on and spoke to WFAA in an interview this week.She said: I thought we were completely on the same page...

In an exclusive interview with the Sunday Mirror, the Labour leader spelled out his plans for the year ahead. His party has been on a war footing since the last election and he thinks those preparations might come in very useful. On his predictions for , he said: “The Government is going to struggle. It may well resign. There may well be a general election. And I can’t wait.” If Labour wins, he says he already has a Brexit plan –to Brussels and negotiate the best possible deal. And Mr Corbyn insists he will make sure Theresa May’s deal is thrown out by Parliament.   “I’m determined to hold this government to account, vote the deal down and reopen those negotiations,” he declared. “We know what we’re doing. We’re clear on our objectives. This government is getting it badly wrong and a lot of jobs are at riskthey go on like this.” He said the Government had reneged on its vow to hold a meaningful vote and his priority was to secure one soon so the present plan could be voted down. If Britain were to leave the EU, Mr Corbyn added that “on current form we would be very badly off”. He told how a briefing by his shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth had highlighted the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. “Jon gave us an outline at the last Shadow Cabinet meeting of just some problems the NHS would face,” he said. “For example, insulin isn’t made in the UK – it has to be imported from Europe.”   More than a million people with shydiabetes live in the UK, yet the main manufacturers are all based abroad. And Mr Corbyn said quitting the EU without a proper deal would cause other complications. “We’d be stuck in a backstop with no escape unless approved by the EU. Andwe fail to get a deal we’d end up with World Trade Organisation conditions from the end of March. “That would be disastrous for manufacturing. “That’s why I’ve put forward the need for a customs union with the EU and access to the single market.” The May deal will be debated and finally voted on when Parliament s in January. Mr Corbyn said a second referendum was still possible, though he does not feel the House would back such a move. On how he would vote in one, he said: “It would depend what the question was – but we’re quite far from that anyway and I’m not sure there’s the support for it in Parliament. The issue is protecting jobs, manufacturing and the rights and conditions we’ve got – not making us the bargain basement of Europe.” He is confident of being able to shynegotiate successfully with Brussels and would ensure his Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer was involved.  “We’d obviously be doing it jointly,” he said. “I’d be involving my Cabinet in what we did – something Theresa May appears not to do. Keir would be free to travel to Brussels as many times as he likes. The Eurostar is quite good fun.” The final Prime Minister’s Questions of the year saw Mr Corbyn pose a number of queries about Brexit. But they were overshadowed by a row as he was caught on camera muttering something at the Tory benches. Social media was quick to accuse him of mouthing “stupid woman” at the PM. But he says: “I’d put six questions to the Prime Minister. I pointed out they were spending poundbillion of public cash in preparation for a no deal when there are , NHS vacancies and , police officers have lost their jobs. “At the end she and her colleagues – and it all looked pre-orchestrated – turned it into a pantomime. And I just stared at them and muttered to myself, ‘Stupid people’. That’s all. “Minutes later it was all over Twitter. The furore in the media and Parliament after was utterly contrived.”  Mr Corbyn said he was regularly barracked and shouted at during PMQs. “You can’t help but hear it,” he added, “but it doesn’t bother me. I don’t lose sleep on a Tuesday or a Wednesday night. “Or any other night for that matter. If people are shouting at me, they’re usually doing it for a reason.” He contrasted the Commons scenes with another story this week about a homeless man dying at Westminster Tube station – yards from the entrance to Parliament. Mr Corbyn said: “He’s not the first person to die outside Parliament but somehow this is not a story that’s worth talking about. “Hang on, we’re the world’s sixth richest country yet people are out there desperate for something to eat and a warm, dry place to sleep. Like this man. He won’t be the last person to die on our streets.” He told how his Islington constituency has a growing population of outdoor sleepers. “Within five minutes’ walk from here a very large number of people are sleeping rough in Finsbury Park and under the railway bridge there,” he said. “I talk to many of them. “Lots of people round here give them support. That’s great. But they need a place to live. The solution has to be institutionalising food banks and shelters. We need to institutionalise the belief everyone deserves somewhere to live.”  He said meeting a homeless person on a train made him realise how serious the issue is – and he has vowed to end rough sleeping during Labour’s first term. “It’s incredible how people end up on the streets,” said Mr Corbyn. “A guy asked me for some cash on the train last year. I gave him some then asked what happened to him. He told me, ‘A few months ago I felt I was doing well. I got a job as a bar manager, with a flat and decent pay. “Then I found I didn’t actually have a job – I was self-employed so I had no rights. They got rid of me. I explained to my landlord. He said it wasn’t his problem and threw me out.’ So in a month this man went from what he thought was secure to sleeping rough.” Mr Corbyn hopes Parliament will give more time to issues affecting the country. “This week there was an hour of Commons time given over to spurious points of order,” he said. “Laura Pidcock raised Universal Credit and poverty but was barracked by Tory MPs. It shows the Tories shypriorities – that they want to ignore the stress people are living under.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 5 told mum worried","story":"NewsBoy, , told mum he worried about the homeless - so they did something wonderfulKylie OBrien, , of Porthcawl, Wales said her son Osian Harries became concerned about the plight of the homeless after a shopping trip in CardfShareCommentsByPhilip Dewey:,  DEC NewsOsian helped make up  bags of gts and distributed them to the homeless \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA schoolboy has been spreading Christmas cheer to those less fortunate by handing out gts to the homeless.Osian Harries, five, has been on a mission to help give those less fortunate than himself a good Christmas.

Peter and Jean Fowlers Christmas dinner was thrown into turmoil after their local Crawshaws refused to accept their stamps. The couple, from Bransholme, Hull, had saved up for months to treat themselves to a turkey, beef, ham and pork over the festive period. Theyve been told that they wont receive a refund until the new year, and they say theyve been forced to borrow money to pay for their Christmas food, Hull Live reports.   The Fowlers had planned to use their stamps at Crawshaws branch in North Point shopping centre. Mrs Fowler, , said: “I have been buying these stamps since January to pay for all the meat this Christmas, and now I’m being told I can’t use them. “I’m on oxygen at the moment and my husband is out of work, so money is very tight for us and we were relying on these stamps. Now we’re being told we won’t be getting a refund until after January.”   Crawshaws, which has shops around the country, went into administration earlier this year. However, the Hull stores were saved from closure after another firm bought them out at the last minute. Mr Fowler, , said: “We’re going to have to borrow the money now to pay for our Christmas meat, but I’m not speaking out just for us. “I can’t help but think about the families out there who are relying on these stamps to feed their children over Christmas, and they might not even know yet they can’t use them.”   Mr and Mrs Fowler were told to send their stamps to the Crawshaw office in order to qualy for a refund, which they were told would take just days.

Mrs Fowler said: “I photocopied my stamp book and sent it through the post office on recorded delivery. “I did it after seeing a note in the door of the shop saying they would no longer be accepting the stamps and gave us a number to contact. “I appreciate we will be getting a refund but the end of January is just too late.

Steve Stratton, , quit his job to look after son Joe but was unable to save him from his addiction to prescription drugs, reports Essex Live. Steve said Joe bought hundreds of the pills on the dark web.The -year-old had tried to talk Joe out of his habit but his nightmare came true on September  when he found the body of his son at his flat in Chelmsford, Essex.Steve, who had cared for Joe through his debilitating mental health issues, described the moment he screamed not my boy after finding his son. He admits his le as he knew it ended that day. At an inquest on Friday at Essex Coroner’s Court recorded an open verdict regarding Joes death.   Joe, a -year-old father-of two, had died as a result of taking in a high dose of codeine and pregabalin. But at the heart of his death lies a y battle Joe had with his mental health, his father claims. Steve, a nurse who has worked in mental health himself for around  years, said: Joe started to get really unwell - awful depression, panic attacks, anxiety and this inability to manage situations which people who didn’t suffer from mental health wouldn’t have. Those situations were quite catastrophic for Joe, for some people they would say this is really awful, but for him they were really magnied tenfold. I was leading away from work and having to weigh up a balance in caring for Joe. Then, as we know he got on the wrong side of the law, which I firmly believe was his poor judgement and vulnerability from his mental health. In , when Joe was aged , Steve decided to leave his work in order to become his son’s full time carer. Joe had a few run ins with the law, being spared jail in February  when Steve wrote an emotional letter to the judge. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how the vulnerable -year-old had acted as a custodian for almost pound, of cocaine. He was handed a two-year prison term, suspended for two years, for possessing drugs with an intent to supply. “I did all I could as his dad to look after him and care for him,” Steve said. “That meant getting him rehoused and fighting his corner in terms of benefits and just being there every single day to make sure he had had his medication on time and his meals on time. “He became a massive part of my le, even more than he ever was. “We were inseparable.”   He added: “I rescued him so many times from real depths of depression and I pointed him in what I thought was the right direction. “He had a daughter and he adored her. “The mother of his daughter was really fantastic and she understood and cared for Joe. “She felt it was important that he didn’t have the misery of being excluded because of his mental health. “I looked after him and they would stay at my flat. “Then he met another girl after they split up, and they had a baby - she’s just a year old now - and he adored her.” After fighting his son’s corner for so long Steve managed to get his son a flat of his own in Chelmsford. Joe moved in over the Easter period of this year and Steve says everyone around him felt it would lead to things improving. “You hold onto anything you can but behind the scenes was this gradual deterioration in his mental health and a real problem with the mental health services,” Steve said. “It was such a struggle to get continued mental health treatment, care and support. So it was down to just me and mum. “We know that Joe had an addiction and that had gone from alcohol, to drugs and then he would have these clear periods where he wasn’t interested in anything. “He would get back to the gym, he would go cycling, he would join the boxing club and this kind of went in cycles.” Steve said: “There was a swapping and exchanging of medicine until he was prescribed this medicine called pregabalin. “Pregabalin was what killed him.” He added: “Pregabalin is now a controlled drug.   “When the coroner phoned us and said that was the cause - it was a reaction of the codeine enhanced by the pregabalin. “That’s what killed him.” Joe was going through an intense amount of pain, so much so that his dad suspects he completely mismanaged the amount of drugs he was taking. “Joe would have popped Co-codamol like Smarties to get rid of the pain,” Steve said. “That was part of his mental health. “A week or so before his death I noticed he was quite sedated. “I went to see him and I think now looking back that’s when we said goodbye to each other. “Here in the background was the Grim Reaper and I said ‘I’m worried about you Joe. You’re slipping away from me and I think you’re going to dieyou keep getting confused and taking this medication. “He was buying the same prescription off of the dark web and he wasn’t buying them singularly, he was buying  at a time. “I couldn’t stop him and I said ‘Joe I will stop your benefits, I am your power of attorney’. ‘I’ll take the drugs and I’ll put them down the toilet’. “We tried everything and of course I was met with conflict with him and it just upset him. “Such was his mental illness and his inability to sleep he wanted to sedate himself and have his own control over him. “But he mismanaged it.” Steve continued: “He said to me ‘dad don’t be stupid I’m not going to die - I know what I’m doing’. “I cycled home that night and I was crying. “I was crying thinking that I’d lost my son. “I cuddled him on the doorstep and I knew he’d gone.”   With Joe seemingly on the mend around Easter time, Steve decided to take that opportunity to get back into education and complete a Masters degree. But on the day Joe died, Steve got bogged down with work. “On the day Joe died I was at my laptop and I never saw Joe in the day,” he explained. “I will always live with the fact thatI hadn’t got stuck at that laptop I would have been with Joe and I didn’t go to him. “I just went straight home. “Sometimes he slept for long periods and we would leave him and he would get up in the night and take more sedatives - his prescribed medication. “But when he had his sleep we would get back together and talk. Steve, along with Joe’s mother, discovered his son. It never gets easier hearing how and for Steve it is still a horrendous episode to retell. “His mum then said - as I had keys to the flat - we ought to really go round and see him,” Steve said about that night. “I cycled from mine to Joe’s, it was .pm and a warm evening. “It was the beginning of September and we met at the flat in Wharf Road. “I had butterflies a bit, Mum did as well, and we got up and knocked. “He didn’t answer so I put the key in the door and the chain was on. “I shouted through the door and there was no answer so I smashed the door down. “We went into the front room and he was laying there with his vape in one hand and his mobile phone in the other on his mattress in the front room. “That was very common because he slept in the front room by watching telly. “He was there propped up and I thought he was asleep and I went ‘hey alright boy ’ “Of course as I got closer we saw that he was dead. “I screamed and said ‘not my boy!’ “I ran out into the road, I screamed, and people came out on the balconies. “I went back upstairs and we tried to resuscitate him and the emergency services were on the phone on loudspeaker. “I hit his chest but I knew he was dead and he had been for a long while.” Paramedics and the police both showed up quickly on the day Joe was found - with Steve giving a special mention to those that attended and the amazing work that they do. But the repercussions will be there for ever. “As dramatic as it might seem my le ended that day,” he said. “I never will recover from this, this is what I do everyday. “I just exist at the minute, there’s never a minute where I’m not thinking of him and that exhausts me anyway. “I can’t reach him, I can’t tell him I love him, I can’t phone him, I can’t cuddle him and I can’t care for him. “I have a photo of him and I kiss that photo every night before I go to bed.” Through the pain Steve is now determined to do something good and bring a sense of positivity out of Joe’s untimely death. While his own recovery will take some time - he is planning on spending time at a retreat with other parents who have lost children in January - his attention is turning to raising awareness over mental health and the dangers of prescription drugs. He’s also keen to look after his grandchildren - who he sees a lot of Joe in. “He’s not going to die in vain,” said Steve. “The biggest thing for me is this ease of access to people who buy prescription drugs and how easy it is to get it. “You can find it and you can buy whatever medicines you want. “People can’t get the service they needthey’re ill so they turn themselves to self-medicating and here is the end result. “Drugs like pregabalin, you have to be aware of the interactions, the indications and the management side. “I hope I did all I can to give my son the best le he can - that’s all I wanted to give him in amongst his mental illness. “Some people thought Joe took his le but that wasn’t the case. “But nonetheless its only two or three clicks away to the dark web.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dog lover dedicates christmas nine","story":"NewsDog lover dedicates Christmas to NINE dogs with stockings and their own dinnerEXCLUSIVE: Ali Murphy will spend most of her Christmas Day pampering her nine pooches, including five Great Danes and a PekingeseShareCommentsByPeter Robertson:,  DEC News \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDog lover Ali Murphy will enjoy Britain’s most barking mad Christmas - with the whole festive season dedicated to her pampered pooches.

Doctors feared that large cysts compressing her airways could potentially lead to fatal breathing problems at birth. Taylor and Cha were given the devastating news that Eden might not make it past her first day. But at .pm on August , , miracle baby Eden defied all the odds and was delivered by C-section in a room full of doctors, paediatric ENT surgeons and NICU nurses.  She was born with a lymphatic malformation in the form of a mass on her neck. Two years, countless hospital visits and nine treatments later, Eden has kept surprising doctors and defying the odds to become a perfect, happy and beautul little girl. Shes also become a big sister to three-month-old Auggie Raye. In a bid to kick the stigma of her disability, Edens mother Cha has opened up about their lives and has started writing a blog about their journey. Providing an intimate, emotional and personal glance at their lives, Cha opens up about everything: from the dark, scary beginnings of her pregnancy, to disgusting comments from trolls the family have encountered online and finally, the beautul young girl Eden has become. Heres a look at just one of Chas inspirational blog posts, which was originally published on the Love What Matters website.The night before she came, we were up late, Cha writes. I was so anxious. I cried so many times that night. I was so scared of the unknown. How could I be excited when I didn’t know what was going to happen to our baby  I felt a whirlwind of emotions, I was SO excited but more fearful. Will she survive  Will she be breathing  Will I get to see her before they take her  There were so many things going through my mind it was impossible for me to go back to sleep. So, I got out of bed and got ready for one of the biggest and most important days of my le. Too shaky and nervous to drive themselves to the hospital, Cha and Taylor were driven by family members and Cha was hooked up to a number of monitors to observe the baby.  It was strange, sitting there just the two of us, waiting to be rolled back to the operating room. We managed a few nervous smiles and laughs. We kept talking and wishing that we’d soon be a family, and that our baby girl would be OK. I wasn’t nervous at this point. I tried to switch off from what was happening - otherwise, I would have gone into complete frantic mode. I don’t think it had quite hit me yet. But it wasnt long before the true reality of the situation started to set in. All the fear and nerves that I carried right through my pregnancy hit me all at once, Cha writes. Taylor tried to help me stay calm, but he was just as nervous.  This was it - there was no turning back, and for a second, I wished I could have stayed in that moment forever. Where I knew I could keep my baby safe breathing inside me. I had carried her for the past nine months and soon doctors would be taking her away from me, ready to try and save her le. Around  doctors and nurses were involved in the delivery of Eden, so much that they filled the whole corridor outside the operating room. It was such a tiny room - I began to feel claustrophobic. I tried my best to not look at how many people were actually in the room as it made the situation a million times scarier. I was rolled onto the cold operating table to begin [the birth]. Was this really happening   Cha was given spinal pain killers and doctors immediately began the C-section surgery. Taylor kept reassuring me that everything was going fine and suddenly - within  minutes of going into the operating room - I heard the most beautul loud cries! I can’t even tell you what I felt at this moment in time, Cha said. Everyone was in complete shock. Our baby was here and she was crying - just like some miracle. No one was expecting it and even some nurses began to cry with us. I was in complete disbelief. It all felt so surreal. I have never felt a flood of joy like I did that moment we heard our daughter cry. It was something we were told was unlikely to happen - even though I spent nine months praying it would. Eden was taken immediately for medical checks, where doctors made sure she was healthy and her airways were clear.  She was then brought briefly back to Cha, before being whisked away once more to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Tears of joy were streaming down our faces and Taylor stroked my hair and askedI was okay. I only had a quick glimpse of Eden as they had to take her down to the NICU. I wanted her to be warm and safe more than I wanted to hold her right away. I was eventually wheeled out of the OR and brought to the recovery ward. It wasnt long before Chas anaesthetic started to wear off, and as the physical pain increased, so did Chas longing to see her newborn baby. I looked at all the other mothers with their babies and I felt helpless, she writes in her blog. My baby was alone with strangers and I no longer had control of anything. ‘When can I see my baby ’ I asked the nurse who was taking my vitals. Around six hours after giving birth, Cha was finally allowed to meet her daughter, and was taken to the NICU by wheelchair. I was finally able to gaze at our baby through a plastic baby incubator, and although there were wires all over her beautul new skin and into her tiny little nose, they never once stole who she was.  She was beautul even with all those tubes and wires, and I just couldn’t believe she was mine. I stroked her head, staring into her tiny incubator and told her how much I loved her. She was our miracle baby. They finally lted her out of her incubator and I got to hold her. I instantly felt whole again. She completed us. I felt a love that I never knew was possible. I got to hold her for nearly an hour before I had to leave her for the night to get my rest. After such a traumatic pregnancy, Cha and Taylor were warned to prepare for the worst. But after just two days in intensive care, little fighter Eden was moved to the ward with Cha before the two of them were allowed home: which meant Cha and her baby spent the same amount of time in hospital as a normal C-section patient. The weeks that followed were long and slow, and at seven weeks old Eden was admitted into Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital, where she spent nearly a month of her young le.  We did our very best to get her home, Cha said. We fought medical teams and proved our worth. We learned how to care for our daughter beyond the requirements of any parent. We were medically trained. We knew more than some doctors did about her condition. All we knew were hospital walls, MRI scans, and car journeys. I cried every day. We couldn’t have gotten through that time without our family visiting every day. We loved her so much then, as we do now. Finally, baby Eden was allowed home. She came home, and it was a miracle. She defied odds. She proved people wrong. She got rid of tubes and wires like they were nothing at all. We never expected it, but she DID IT. When we found out Eden had a lymphatic malformation, we were scared. We searched the Internet looking for any answers. We were told Eden wouldn’t be normal. We were told she would be malformed. We were told there was a chance she wouldn’t survive.  Cha said doctors were concerned about the size of the mass putting pressure on Edens airways. We were told surgery would be a normal course of le for years to come, she wrote. But, here we are two years on, countless hospital visits and nine treatments later - with our perfect happy little girl. Eden is now two years old and so far has had a total of eight sclerotherapy treatments and a laser and cyst removal on her tongue to help reduce the size of the mass in both her neck and tongue. Shes due to have a tongue reduction in January next year and will eventually undergo serious surgical removal for the remainder of the malformation. I don’t know how its possible, but all of this has just made me love this little girl so much more, Cha writes in her blog. She is such a fighter and my heart grows bigger with love for her every single day.  We won’t let Eden’s illness define her and although we can’t do anything about it, we want to give her the best chance of beating it - physically and emotionally, Cha said. We still have a long journey ahead of us and no-one knows what challenges we may face along the way. We have had to learn to do things we should never have to as parents and we have built up courage that we didn’t know we had. But we have come so far. If I have learned one thing as a mother, its that motherhood is a journey filled with ups and downs. Just when I think I have it all figured out, the game changes, but I still never give up on hope. Above all, rather than trying to be the perfect mother, I try to be the best mother by always giving my best.”This story was was originally published on the Love What Matters website.

Two police vans and a car remain at their semi-detached, new build house in Crawley, West Sussex, just three miles away from the airport. There is still a police presence at Gatwick, while vans from Thames Valley, Kent and the Met Police were seen parked in nearby Horley, Surrey. Neighbours described Paul and Elaine as a hard working couple who graft six days a week, and share a a love of gadgets. Bob Simpkin, , said: Paul is what you could describe as an average person, a hard working builder.  I was shocked to hear what happened, I do believe the police have got the wrong people - this is totally out of character. Last night I heard a lot of screaming and shouting, when I looked outside I saw a woman being led to a police van by a female copper. The van was parked outside their house and I saw a woman led into the van. Paul and Elaine have been together for about five years - I sometimes see a young lad of about ten there too. Elaine doesnt seem the person to get involved in any trouble - she works a lot too from what I can tell.  Bob, now retired, is a fundraiser for military charity The Danny Gallivan Trust - but used to run his own carpentery company. He said: Paul is the kind of man I would have given a jobI was still running my company. He has done a lot of work around his house, he built his own conservatory. When I saw his work I asked him to help me and he came over and gave me a hand with a room upstairs. Paul never came across as a nutter and he had no silly opinions.  Another neighbour, who wished not to be named, said: They dont seem the type to do this, theyre down to earth. Hes a builder and she works somewhere six days a week. They keep themselves to themselves really.  I see why the police are investigating - its likeyou had a big flash car that was out of place. Another neighbour said: Paul is a hard working family man, it is unbelievable. These are just two lovely people that met dog walking and worked six days a week.

This time last year Hayley Martin was preparing to give birth to Ava-Joy. Heartbreakingly, the little one had been diagnosed with a fatal condition shyhalfway through the pregnancy. Hayley and her husband Scott were told they could opt for a shytermination. Instead they decided to go ahead with the birth – so Ava’s organs might be donated to desperately ill babies. But Ava, who survived for  shyminutes was underweight for a donor and died in her parents’ arms.   Now Hayley has revealed she is  weeks pregnant and is due to give birth just  days after what would have been Ava’s first birthday. And she plans to train as a shybereavement midwe to help others in similar heartbreaking situations. Speaking to the Sunday People, which first revealed her incredible story, Hayley said: “There has been such pain for us as a family this year. “But I couldn’t be more overjoyed to be carrying this baby.

The mum-of-three gave up her porn career for her children but now fears she will have toto adult films just to feed them. The cruel new benefit system is being rolled out in her area and Emily is fearful she could be left waiting weeks on end for her first payment leaving her with no choice but to do porn for quick cash. Emily is a mum-of-three and despite working part-time, she is worried her benefits could be cut under the new system. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  Her daughter is disabled and Emily says she would rather put herself at risk and do porn than let her childs quality of le suffer. During her s, Emily worked as apornstar and modelled for several lads mags. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Emily said: “It’s like we’ve ed to Victorian times with mums having to do X-rated videos or prostitute themselves in order to put food in their children’s bellies. How has it come to this  “I don’t want to go back topornbut what  can I do  I’ll make pound for a few scenes and still be home in time to collect my kids from school. At least I have that option to make some good cash, other people don’t.” Emily spent her younger years in care after being abused by members of her family.In her late teens, her then boyfriend convinced her to respond to a call for models in a top lads mag.  She was then offered a large sum of money to star in apornfilm and her X-rated career continued for the next decade. Emily, now is her s, spent years travelling Europe to star in films and while she did not enjoy the work, she did it for the money and the freedom that offered her. “I used to just zone out,” she said. “They used to coerce me into doing things I didn’t want to do but I just thought of the money and got on with it. It did end up causing me a very bad injury...down there. I had to go to hospital, it was really traumatic but I went back for the money. “It felt very glamorous at the time, because I had lovely clothes to wear, had my make-up done, and I felt very special. No one had ever made me feel special.   “I felt good about it at the time but I was younger then. “I was talked into it by the vast amount of money I was offered basically. “It would have been around pound for sex with a male model - hardcore porn. “It’d take a couple of hours, I’d had HIV tests all the time because some of the male models did gay porn as well. “I really liked doing the magazine shoots and that because it wasn’t dangerous. “When you’re on a porn shoot, you put on a persona, it’s like a mask.   “But I look back and I feel ashamed, I was brought up in a very religious household. “I think theres a real stigma about porn in the UK, it’s just not the done thing is it  “People treat me terribly when they find out.

My daughter is disabled, she suffers from a learning disability and goes to special school, I cant work full-time because of child care costs and childminders dont like having her because of her behaviour. I take her to lots of dferent activities like horse riding and swimming which help her and I dont want to have to stop all thatmy benefits are cut. “If I go back to porn I’m putting myself at risk because this is unprotected sex - I’m at risk of HIV and other STIs. “I feel utterly degraded even thinking about going back to it especially because I never thought I would have to do this again. “But I can’t get another job so this is an easy way to make money while the kids are at school.  “I don’t want to go back to it but I’d do anything - even prostitute myself - to feed my kids. “I’d be too embarrassed to queue up at a food bank or beg people to donate gts for my children at Christmas. “I just couldn’t do it, but at least this way I could make enough money to take my daughter to her activities.

People living in the potential flood zones have been warned to be prepared, as the Met Office expects wet and windy weather over the next few days. Rain will be heavy at times as it sweeps across the nation on Saturday night and Sunday, setting up a soggy start to the festive period as millions hit the roads. But rain will begin to taper off on Christmas Eve, while Christmas Day is expected to be mostly dry and cloudy with some patchy rain.  It means those hoping for a white Christmas will be disappointed. Temperatures will stay mild over the next week - hitting the double digits in some regions - but they wont be pleasant in places where it is wet and windy. The Environment Agency has issued  flood alerts for England, while Natural Resources Wales has issued five. Many streams are almost at capacity, and further rain could see them breach their banks, putting homes, businesses and roads at risk of flooding. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern told the Express: “There will be a frost in the north of Scotland on Saturday morning.  “Chilly start to the day, here, temperatures a few degrees below freezing. “One or two fog patches, as well, that will all clear up and a crisp, sunny day to come for the north-east of Scotland.” Long spells of sunshine are expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, he added, with showers affecting mostly western and central parts of Scotland. But showers will spread across the country in the evening and weather fronts will bring a wet start to the day on Sunday, he said. Heavy rain will move into the Midlands, East Anglia, northern England, Northern Ireland and the south of Scotland. It will be breezy in places.  Journey times are expected to be longer in severe weather. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be dry in most places. Ladbrokes has slashed its odds that Christmas Day this year will be the warmest ever. Its now a   chancethat the mild temperatures will set a new record. The odds of a white Christmas are  .Jessica Bridge, a spokeswoman for Ladbrokes, said: Unfortunately, it now looks like were going to have a wet Christmas instead of a white one, but the country can at least rejoice in the warm temperatures on offer. She added: Although, its perhaps not quite warm enough to barbecue the turkey and sprouts. Is there a flood alert in my area  Thirty-seven flood alerts are in place in England and five in Wales as of Saturday morning.

WednesdayBoxing Day should be mostly settled with a ridge of high pressure across the UK. Southerly winds will bring mild air across many parts making Boxing Day a rather cloudy affair with drizzly patches over western coasts and hills. The best of any bright or sunny spells likely in the east or north-east. What is the New Years Eve forecast  A precise forecast for New Years Eve will become clearer in the next few days, but temperatures are expected to be average. Some places in the north could see heavy rain and strong winds. Heres the Met Offices outlook for Thursday  December to Friday  January: Through the remainder of December and into early January settled conditions should dominate bringing iable amounts of cloud across many parts with temperatures generally around normal.

Cindy Cottrell - who left home aged just  and lived off Pot Noodles - can afford a little luxury this Christmas, thanks to taking her kit off for a living. She now earns up to pound, per week and, in her own words, has made her le comfortable for her family as a result, Birmingham Live reports.I had an argument with my mum and I left home, explained Cindy, , who fell pregnant two years after leaving home. I stayed at my nans for a bit before moving to a horrible sh**hole in Kingstanding. I was living off pound in benefits.  I couldnt even afford to get to college and I contemplated not having my baby because I couldnt afford a child. I reached rock-bottom. During a time of desperation Cindy, from Great Barr, Birmingham, was introduced to exotic dancing and web cam work by a friend. I started dancing and a friend of mine suggested Id do web-camming, she added. I was like, Oh my God but I decided to give it a go. Ive been doing it ever since and now Ive got my own apartment, a nice new BMW X and I can afford to support my -year-old son.  Cindy earns up to pound, PER WEEK and, in her own words, has made her le comfortable for her family - especially at Christmas. I love my son to bits. Hes aware of what I do and were going to have a great Christmas together - me, my mum and him. An average day for the single mum involves getting glammed up in sexy lingerie before turning her web cam on, with alerts pinging through to let her know paying customers are ready and waiting. She charges pound-a-minute and aims to keep men logged on for as long as possible. What Id do is Id get ready, put all my make-up on and all the sexy lingerie and Id spend around three hours at a time sitting there talking to men, she said.  Its all online and it goes ding-ding when someone wants to speak to you. You cant really go off and do other things and it can be quite tedious but I keep them talking for as long as possible, asking them where theyre from and stuff. I type instead of speaking because it takes longer. Everything can come off, bra and knickers. I have to put on the website that Im working that day and Im available. I dont do it all the time because it can be too much, you can lose yourself. Since going public about my work, Ive literally had  or so girls inbox me on Facebook asking about how I got into it and what its like. I tell them its so easy and the money is great but, once you get into it, theres no getting out.  Ive tried other jobs but nothings as easy and so well paid. What Id tell girls is to be very careful, it can take over your le which is why Ive tried to step back a little. Ive been doing it since I was a teenager. Girls I know have gotten into drugs to deal with their work - so it can be a dangerous game. Its my job and now I can afford nicer things in le and I can afford to support my family. Ive got no shame, none whatsoever.   Its a million miles away from where I was thats for sure, sitting there eating noodles at Christmas. When askedshed ever give web-camming up, Cindy added: No, its always there for me and its a job. You do lose your pride but Id prefer to lose that and have food on the table. Im not a millionaire, Im a mum who just wants to provide for her family. Were looking forward to a great Christmas, just like everyone .

Sightings of the mystical Scottish beast have reached another record for this century after Caroline Barnett, , saw Nessie over the internet. The business consultant from Farmborough, near Bath was tuning into the Loch Ness Webcam at .am on Wednesday when she clocked something move up the loch. She told the Daily Record: It popped up and down - and kept doing it. It kept splashing about. It was quite a size - the size of a boat but it was hard to tell because it was the other side of the loch. I have been to Loch Ness a few years ago but never saw Nessie then. I didnt knowI believed in her but this is certainly some Christmas present and quite a surprise. I took quite a few videos but my phone died. I dont know what it is - it really is unexplained. Experts have accepted the images. Initially she thought it was a boat or similar but the object appeared animate and then disappeared into the water before reappearing. It was dark in colour and nearer the east shore of the loch, said Gary Campbell, recorder of the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register.   The sighting - the th this year - comes just six days a best-selling author saw a mysterious creature with a ft neck and a head the size of a rugby ball.Ricky D Phillips, a British military historian - whose works include The First Casualty, The Untold Story of the Falklands War - said he was baffled by the sight. Mr Phillips from Edinburgh also works as a tour guide and was leading a party of eight foreign tourists who went on a cruise on Loch Ness while he went a got a chippy. It was as he rested at the River Oich, just as it flows into Loch Ness at Fort Augustus, that Mr Phillips saw the strange sight at .pm. It was a grey creature - almost bird like - in a grey stretch of water. Its neck was three to four feet long, a head the size of a rugby ball and a ridge across its eyes, said Mr Phillips, .I was baffled. The previous Wednesday I had heard a strange noise as I was stood by a cafe at the edge of the loch in Fort Augustus. The noise sounded almost metallic, but like something was blowing air - like Darth Vader.   I have swum and sailed with whales and dolphins, seen hundreds of seals, and it sounded like nothing I have ever heard. I spun around and saw something grey, just a side of a body and a flipper. Okay, this could have been something explainable, so I left quite interested but unsure. The noise was really weird though. Then last Thursday after my tour party went on their cruise I decided to take a walk along the river Oich, mainly to see the old bridge, and was taking a few pictures of the loch and the scenery when I again heard that curious noise. I looked up from my phone and saw a long, straight neck, all completely grey, and a narrow face, which was only about ft away and then it turned and disappeared all in a few seconds. I looked down and realised that it was in my picture, so zoomed in and there it was. It actually looks like a giant bird or a peacock in the face, with high ridges above its eyes and what almost looks like a beak. I know dinosaurs came from birds and that many had hard lips, almost like a beak - but this is simply what I saw. It seems to have almost a frill on its neck. It is very odd. All I will say is that,I was going to fake a Nessie, I would certainly have made it look less like a bird and more like... well, more like what we think Nessie looks like!   The image has been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register. It is a record year for seeing Nessie this century, said Mr Campbell. Sightings are now at a level that were being recorded in the s. There are more visitors to the Highlands now so that may have something to do with it. It was in , Mr Campbell saw something resembling a mini whale - with a black shiny back - at the south end of the loch. Since then Mr Campbell has researched and logged over  sightings. He accepted  sightings this year, but one referred to an image taken in  and will be logged for that year - meaning that Nessie has been sighted  times in . In  there were  sightings, then a record for this century. In recent years the most sightings in a year we have had is  - and that was in . Before that the s and s were the times that had most sightings - sometimes more that  in a year, added Mr Campbell. According to Google there are , searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster. The monster mystery was estimated recently to be worth poundm to the region. Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in AD. Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in  by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson. The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

Tear gas, water canon and baton charges were used by riot police on a so-called ‘Act VI’ Day of Rage organised by the Yellow Vest movement.  people were arrested in Paris alone by pm, including Eric Drouet, one of the group’s leaders. He is accused of organising an illegal demonstration on a public road, carrying an offensive weapon, and taking part in group violence, said a Paris prosecuting source. Many others are under investigation for similar public order offences.  Some of the worst trouble was on the Champs Elysee, where thousands of Christmas shoppers were caught up in the fighting, as stores, restaurants and cafes were forced to shut early. There were similar scenes in cities such as Bordeaux, Toulouse and Marseille, where rioters also took to the streets. It came as a tenth member of the Yellow Vests movement died during blockades organised at major roads around France. The -year-old man, who has not been identied publicly, died after being hit by a lorry at a roundabout in Perpignan, in the south of the country.  The victim was with a group of demonstrators when the accident happened just before midnight on Friday, said a local police spokesman. An enquiry has been launched. The Vests have been protesting since November  and, despite a range of concessions by President Macron including scrapping green taxes of diesel and petrol, continue to call for him to step down. ‘Macron Resign’, a crowd shouted today as they gathered at Montmartre, the tourist district overlooking Paris first thing on Saturday morning. There had been claims that they would gather at the ancient palace of Versailles, to the west of the capital, but this turned out to be a ersion. Jean Caron, a -year-old from Brittany, said: Our protests have been hugely successful in Paris itself, and that’s why we’re back here.  What everybody now realises is that the government cannot control us, and that’s why we will continue until Macron resigns. Last Saturday there were almost  arrests for public order offences across the city, while last month some  were held in custody on a single day. High-end shops including luxury fashion boutiques were boarded up in Paris, along with banks and post offices. Mounted police, water cannons, and  armoured vehicles capable of spreading high-intensity gas were all on standby as part of the security operation.  They have failed to prevent widespread disorder over the past few weekends, with the worst violence normally coming at nightfall. The Vests have been joined by extremists from the far right and the ultra-left, as well as anarchists intent on causing as much damage as possible. Crisis-ridden Mr Macron has not only climbed down on imposing green surcharges, but increased the national minimum wage by seven per sent, and scrapped tax on bonuses.  But the Yellow Vests said their protests would continue indefinitely as they campaign for even more concessions. The independent Mr Macron, leader of the Republic On The Move party, won the French presidential election in a landslide in , but he is now dubbed the ‘President of the Rich’ with polls showing his popularity rating down to just  per cent.

That was always going to be the case no matter the result.“We’ve got some good players but we need some help.“We’re bottom for a reason so we’ve got to try to strengthen otherwise it’ll be a long season.“I don’t look at where we are just now.“I look at performances, responsibility taken by players in games and the consistency of what we’ve been getting, the decisions being made when a couple of things go against us and how we react.“That’s what I look at and will determine what I need.”Right from kick-off the Dark Blues were second best as Aberdeen moved to within a point of leaders Rangers.Cosgrove’s strikes in  and  minutes sealed the points before calamity at a corner where Andy Boyle and Nathan Ralph bundled each other over to allow Andy Considine a free header just after the break signalled a long second half ahead for the Dark Blues.The manager said: “It wasn’t good enough.

I know what it is like over here from my time with Aston Villa,” he said.“In Switzerland last weekend it was the last game and now every one of my friends is on holiday. They are all sending me pictures so I block them on social media. I’m only kidding, for me it is just nice to be playing.“There is not one bit of jealously, I would rather be here and playing football over Christmas than be on holiday with them.“For me as a foreigner having been involved in the English game and now the Scottish game, I think it is beautul to be playing at this time of year.“You spend time with your family on Christmas Day but Boxing Day it is back into training to prepare for the next game and that’s what I like. We are playing today and then the th, there is no midweek game so it is perfect.“Listen, I live for playing football, I live and breathe football, so for me there is nothing better than having Christmas and then a game right away.”And, for Siegrist, the best Christmas presents he’ll get will be maximum points from Falkirk and Alloa.If United go about their business the way they did up at Inverness last weekend, he believes they will do exactly that.Although that Highland trip saw them have to fight back to earn a point, he believes the level of performance bodes well for what lies ahead in the league programme.“You never know what that point is worth until you finish the season, so that might be a very good one. However, the gaffer spoke about it to us during the week and the way we played compared to the week before at Morton was miles better.“That’s the way we want to play and we believe it gives us the best chance of winning every game or at least most of the games.“You are not going to walk through this league but we like to play with high tempo, pass the ball and cause problems for the opposition we can take advantage of. We just need to put it all together and get the three points.“We should be full of confidence the way we played last week because we know not every opposition can withstand the pressure we put on them.“It’s all about our performance, the way we go on the pitch and put into practice what we think we want to do.“The ability we have in the dressing-room, the characters we have, I think we have a really good team whether that’s in terms of spirit or ability.”After injury forced him off in the recent defeat against Ayr and forced him to miss the draw at Morton, Siegrist admits being recalled to the line-up last weekend was a boost for him.So far this term, one of his biggest battles has been to claim a starting place ahead of Matej Rakovan but that was an indication he’s now considered the first choice keeper by boss Robbie Neilson.“I’ve kind of over-extended when I was ing in the game against Ayr and it was a mixture between a knock and a muscle injury.

Here it is, in full, below.Congratulations on your purchase of Dundee United. I guess the obvious first question is why Dundee United My son Scott and I have been looking for investment in European football for some time. We looked at a lot of dferent options, and we looked at this particular club, the club#s history, the support of the fans, the previous success and rich history.The Irish history appealed because we are of Irish descent. We know the Club had financial issues and that makes it dficult for any Club to be successful.For the Club staff to work within that scenario where there is financial dficulty, you are hampered by that. Decisions are then based on where you are at rather than the best interests of the Club. We felt it was a sleeping giant and we could come in with our advisors and use our business experience to make a dference and get Dundee United back where it needs to be.How much did buying United cost you I will not answer that question directly but what I will say is I have seen some numbers thrown about out there and I wish we were buying it for as little as that! It comes to a combination of money paid to shareholders, money put in for the retirement of debt and a commitment to working capital to ensure funds going forward to do what we need to do to be successful.How long has buying a sporting opportunity in Europe been an interest or passion for you It has been there for several years. Scott#s passion for European football goes back much longer than that. It was his passion that rubbed off on me. His English team is Newcastle United, and we caught a match a few years back and had a lot of fun. In the last year, we really took the interest seriously.Are you looking to make money from this deal Yes. This isn#t a hobby for us, and we expect to make money long-term but, let me say, for that to happen we need to be competing in the Ladbrokes Premiership on a continual basis.How much do you know about Dundee United and Scottish football I know a ton. We spent a tremendous amount of time and money doing our due diligence. Legally, on the business side and on the performance side. We know a lot about Dundee United, and we have researched Scottish football, and we know where we are and where we want to go. We have an excellent plan to get where we want to go.Do you expect to own Dundee United for several years Yes. I expect to own the team long-term.What would you say to reassure Dundee United fans about the long-term future of the Club I guess what I would say is based on the due diligence conducted, spending a lot of time and money researching, we know what we are getting into. This isn#t just a passing fancy where we are going to get in and discover something that would create any issues for us. We are confident about what we are getting into and where we want to go. We would not invest in the Clubwe weren#t convinced about the long-term future of the Club.How does this purchase affect the structure of the Club Mike Martin has stepped down as Chairman, and I would like to recognise the work Mike has done during the process. He is a big fan of the Club, and he has steadied the ship since his appointment in March.As new owners, we are going to take it in a dferent direction. We plan to appoint a Managing Director who will be in charge of running the Club and he will be responsible for the aspects of the commercial and business side of the Club.We will also have a Sporting Director who will be responsible for all the performance aspects of the Club. He will work with Robbie Neilson efficiently and effectively from the Club’s standpoint.We will be making some announcements in the very near future regarding this.What type of Chairman would you describe yourself So I’ll be the Chairman and my son Scott will be the quasi-Vice Chairman. He will sit on the board with me. From a Club perspective, people can expect that I#ll be interested in all that is going on I will be very supportive of what#s going on and who is doing it I will be available whenever, but I will not be a micro-manager. We will have what we think are the right persons in the right positions to be a successful Club and I will absolutely expect results.From a fan perspective, I will be a low profile Chairman and fans will hear more from the Club leadership in the new structure than they will from me.Do you plan to work remotely Yes. I will work remotely and travel over as much as possible. Scott and I have talked about this. We will have board meetings that we will come over for, but we will try to tag-team and come across at separate times, so at least one of us is here as often as possible.How can you get a feel for the Clubyou aren#t over in Dundee With today#s technology it is almost asyou are over there but having the right people in the right positions is what matters. Jimmy Fyffe and David Dorward are still on the board, and we anticipate one or two other people to be on the board from the Dundee area. It is essential for the fans to know we will definitely have local representation and they will be in constant communications.There are American owners at Dundee FC, also within the city. So let me ask this directly. Do you have any plans to merge the clubs No. None whatsoever.Do you have any links at all with the owners of Dundee FC No, I have never met them, and quite frankly I do not even know who they are.Do you have any links to the previous owners of the Club including Stephen Thompson No, I have heard his name, but I have never met or had a discussion with Stephen Thompson. Obviously, I have met Mike Martin and Jimmy Fyffe.You have an interest in a Baseball team. What experience have you gained that will stand you in good stead for a football team based in Dundee I believe firmly, that a person needs to know their limitations. As Chairman and owner that is the situation. As far as performance of the squad aspect of the Club is concerned, I expect to be consulted with, I will be involved and interested in decisions, but in reality, I will defer the main decisions to those that know the game much better than I do. As I said previously, I#m not going to micro-manage. I expect to be much more involved in the business side.Have you spoken to the Head Coach and can you confirm that you see him leading the team forward So when I travelled across recently, I was introduced to Robbie, but quite frankly I don#t even think he knew who I was! I just happened to be a visitor who was introduced. That#s been the extent so far, but in answer to your question, I absolutely do believe he is the man to lead the team forward. He has made a positive impact since his arrival, and he has proven himself with Hearts before.Will he be given financial backing to help in the task of getting the Club back into the Ladbrokes Premiership I guess what I’d say is that it is not an open chequebook, but we absolutely intend to invest the necessary funds to get us into a position to get promoted. Equally important is when we get up we stay there.You will appreciate supporters will be curious and apprehensive about motives. How do you plan to communicate with fans of Dundee United Talk is cheap. What I would say to our supporters is judge us by our actions and, even more importantly judge us on our results. Obviously, due to the structure that I#ve discussed earlier, we will be implementing changes, and the fans will hear from the Club leadership rather than me.What targets do you intend to set for the team and the Club as a whole Let me answer it this way. We are looking at short-term and longer-term targets. The short-term objective is simple # promotion to the Premiership. We expect it is this year absolutely. We need to be United and have the one vision, # success # and get to the Premiership. The timing of the transaction is excellent. We have a transfer window shortly in January, and this will allow us to get with Robbie and figure out the team, andwe need to make some changes, we are ready and willing to do that.Longer-term, maybe three to five years, we need to be competing in the top six of the Premiership. We want to be competing in European competition and challenging in the cups. That#s our ultimate goal."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-charles-rennie-mackintosh-statue-given-cone-treatment-10-days-after-being-unveiled","story":"THE city looks to have quickly taken its newest statue to heart - as itrsquos given the Glasgow cone treatment."},{"url":null,"title":"better-bus-services-are-arriving-says-boss","story":"Bus bosses say passengers will quickly begin to see improvements from a multi-million pound investment."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-wagamama-staff-have-spring-in-their-step-after-christmas-bonus-announcement","story":"Staff at three Glasgow restaurants are over the moon after finding out they will be given Christmas bonuses worth up to pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"planning-boost-in-bid-to-build-new-suburb-in-glasgows-north-east","story":"A BID for  new homes in north Glasgow has taken a leap forward."},{"url":null,"title":"bongos-bingo-behind-one-of-glasgows-wildest-club-nights","story":"SINCE first hitting Glasgow back in , Bongos Bingo has become a regular fixture on the social calendar having racked up more than a dozen events in this year alone."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-star-leigh-griffiths-returns-to-social-media","story":"CELTIC ace Leigh Grfiths has broken his social media silence for the first time since stepping away from the club due to ongoing personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-and-australias-argument-over-tom-rogic-is-a-real-soap-opera","story":"GRAHAM Arnold was granted face-time with Brendan Rodgers on his recent visit to Scotland and came away unexpectedly with an extra player in Martin Boyle."},{"url":null,"title":"airnbnb-glasgow-city-council-bans-estate-agent-from-running-holiday-let","story":"AN estate agent has been banned from running an Airbnb let in a residential block on Glasgowrsquos West End in a landmark case."},{"url":null,"title":"deliveroo-glasgow-delivery-drivers-sacked-en-masse-just-days-before-christmas","story":"TWENTY courier drivers have been sacked just days before Christmas after being accused of fraud by a worldwide delivery service."},{"url":null,"title":"as-the-world-was-partying-we-were-welcoming-babies-meet-the-staff-in-charge-of-glasgows-festive-deliveries","story":"WHILE most of us are opening presents and tucking into turkey, staff at Glasgowrsquos maternity hospitals will be making sure the cityrsquos very special Christmas deliveries have a safe arrival.

We all saw the benefits of having had a left-back in Max andwe can get something like that it might be something we would look at.”Lowe has made  appearances for the Dons this season and has been a regular starter in recent months.Derby boss Lampard opted not to extend Lowe’s loan deal because he is short on left-back options. Scotland international left-back Craig Forsyth suffered a serious knee injury this month that is expected to keep him out for the rest of the campaign.Swedish international Marcus Olsson is still recovering from a long-term knee injury, leaving Scott Malone as the only senior left-back available.McInnes said: “Derby have injury issues with a couple of their left-backs.“Max is going back to play. The feedback is that he is not just going back to sit on the bench.“They have been watching him closely and they see the development in him and how well he has done for us.“I am not surprised Derby feel he can go back there and play now.”While McInnes aims to bring in another left-back in January, he insists there is no panic to land the right candidate as there are players who can operate in that position already at the club.Andy Considine, currently playing at right centre-back while Mikey Devlin is out injured until the new year, has played left-back in recent seasons.McInnes said: “There are people in the building that can play left-back.“We will have defenders coming back in January as well with Mikey Devlin, Mark Reynolds and Tommie Hoban, which helps that side of it.”Centre-back Reynolds ed to full-training yesterday for the first time since undergoing knee surgery in July.McInnes said: “Mark was back in full training and it is brilliant to have him back.“He has been there or thereabouts with us for the last few weeks doing bits and pieces.”Aberdeen will today face Hearts in the knowledge a fourth straight win will keep them in the mix at the top of the Premiership.They are just three points behind leaders Celtic, who they host on Boxing Day.Hearts are reeling after suffering a - loss to Livingston and McInnes expects a reaction.He said: “When you lose that type of game all you do is work even harder.“Hearts have had a whole week to get ready for this game so I am pretty sure they will have been working and getting organised to try to come up here to be harder to play against.“On the back of that matchI don’t think it makes our game any easier.“When you lose like that you expect a reaction from your team and Hearts are too good a team not to have a reaction.“They have too much experience and ability and a good manager who will get them back to winning ways before long. We just have to hope it is after today.”The top five of the Premiership is so congested the Dons could conceivably be sitting top of the table at New Yearthey can maintain their winning streak before the winter shutdown.McInnes refuses to look that far ahead.He said: “It is good that we are in and around it but we are just looking at the next game against Hearts.“However, there is no doubting we can clearly see the benefits of getting consecutive wins.”McInnes has challenged the Reds to beat Hearts today to reach the -point mark at the Premiership’s halfway stage.He said: “We felt it was important to hit the  points after  games.“Hearts is the th game of the Premiership and the halfway stage and it’s normally where we are, on target to break  points.“I said to the players prior to the St Mirren game they have three games to get to  points.“We’ve had those two wins since then, and have taken nine points since Livingston .“Now we go and try to get the next three against Hearts.“If we can win to get that it will give a more familiar reflection of what we normally produce at that halfway stage.”Winger Gary Mackay-Steven is out of today’s clash as he is still recovering from concussion having been knocked unconscious in the - Betfred Cup loss to Celtic on December .He could be fit to face Celtic at Pittodrie on Boxing Day. Centre-back Mikey Devlin is out until January with a foot tendon injury."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/5c189bae22791-767x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen city council backs calls for peoples vote on brexit","story":"Aberdeen City Council has backed a call for a people’s vote on Brexit as its administration was defeated for the first time.Councillors supported the motion  to nine yesterday to back Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill in calling for a people’s vote, with the SNP joining forces with the Lib Dems to defeat the ruling Tory and Labour coalition.The council’s Labour group instead called for the council to support an immediate general election as a way of resolving the Brexit stalemate.But their Conservative administration colleagues lodged an amendment calling for the council to take no action in a rare ision between the two parties.Prime Minister Theresa May has said MPs will vote on the UK’s Brexit deal the week of January .Addressing the chamber, Jenny Laing, co-leader of the council and leader of Aberdeen Labour, said: “There is no doubt in my mind the current Brexit deal is a bad deal for Aberdeen, Scotland and the UK.“We believe the people have a right to vote to elect a new government. A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens back in control and give everyone the chance to decide whether the Prime Minister’s deal is good for the country andthe UK should leave the EU on those terms.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home dec15","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  Lovely laidback ladies Ruby and Sophie are looking for a forever home together.The pair, who are  years old, still enjoy their walks but also like a sofa day too.Someone who is at home most of the time would be ideal for these girls, who are likely to follow their new owner around the home.The pooches, who are not suited to a household with children, will need to be kept on a hypoallergenic diet. vw, px\"  Gorgeous girl Freya is looking for a new owner who can take her on lots of country walks.The six-year-old, who has been neutered, has previously beem around children and will need an owner with experience of the breed.Freya is also used to other dogs but can can be quite vocal with them until she gets to know them.Can you give her a home  vw, px\"  Handsome lad Louie is on the prowl for a new home where he can get outdoors to explore.Although six-month-old Louie can be quite a feisty boy, he also adores receiving cuddles.And when it comes to playtime, this cute cat has lightning reflexes.It is not knownLouie has previously been around other animals or children.Can you give him a home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"building a dream home for childrenhow to donate","story":"A north-east charity’s plans to create a specialist centre will involve a huge range of facilities to support families.Charlie House submitted planning permission to Aberdeen City Council for a site at Woodend Hospital where it hopes to build a specially-designed centre with eight bedrooms and accompanying family accommodation.The charity, which is based in Aberdeen, supports children with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions and their families.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated. If this is what you call habitable condition I wouldn’t like to see what ACHA classes as inhabitable.’Since the Argyllshire Advertiser published the article, Gary maintains the holes in the side of the building have not been filled, the damp not dealt with, nor has black mould in the bedroom.He said: #When they got someone to look at it he just wanted to plaster over the problem. That won#t solve the damp in the whole house.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty.

We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in Tweeddale are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

If you order a drink in Italy, at the very least yoursquore going to get olives, bits of pizza, focaccia, dips. Sometimes the snacks that accompany an ldquoaperitivo amount to a meal, as in Venice. Down the sinuous backstreets and alleys of La Serenissima, yoursquoll find those little bars, bacari, whose cicchetti pre-date the fashion for small plates and tapas. They donrsquot look like much when theyrsquore closed: a narrow front, bottles obscuring the window, a couple of rickety tables outsideyoursquore lucky. Then they spring to le in the early evening when theyrsquore thronged with locals, and the bar tops fill up with plates of Adriatic seafood from the Rialto market, cured meats, local cheeses, salt cod, and much more.Itrsquos this spirit that West Room tries to capture. Drably Venetian decor wouldnrsquot work here. Instead therersquos supersized lampshades, one of those geometric tiled floors that makes you feel dizzyyou look at it for too long, and led walls enclosing a grid of gold leaf squares, the look you get in historic Italian caffegraves that have been recently refurbished.West Room misses a trick: the wine list isnrsquot Italian enough, with only one Venetian red. But the food  It starts and ends well. Fritto misto, the acid test of clean deep-frying, competence with batter, and truly fresh fish, passes with flying colours: pearly squid, stf, crisp whitebait, surprisingly good prawns , a mellow aioli. Focaccia is a touch amateurish, in a good way, less airy than some but with an addictive, salt-dusted, well-oiled crust. Risotto of East Neuk crab with chilli and tomato is fighting an internal battle with itself. The rice is cooked to a correctly firm consistency it forms the requisite gentle slump and you can see ample strands of white crab meat within it. But the acidic whack of the tomato and the heat of the chilli beats its gentle charms into submission. Three fat pea, mozzarella and basil arancini are a steal for pound., interesting too with fresh green peas at their heart and a pesto that tastes homemade.Broad bean bruschetta, meanwhile, is the antithesis of the usual lazy effort. Painstakingly double-podded beans piled high on toasted focaccia spread with whipped ricotta, and heaps of oily fresh mint to dress it. Homemade ravioli of the day constitute another bargain for pound. Their ricotta filling is simple, even timid, the perfect foil, in fact, for a vibrant, handmade parsley pesto. They come with a clutter of toasted hazelnuts, crisped-up cavalo nero, cylinders of salt-baked golden carrots that are still in their skin, and ribbons of sweet pink pickled carrot. The totality, although most definitely not an Italian line-up, makes a jolly interesting veggie option thatrsquos speaks of kitchen effort.Prices of artisan cheese being what they are, I am amazed by our pound. plate of Pecorino al Vino, a mouth-filling cheese from the Veneto that matures in red wine for at least three months. Here are three thick chunks, four crostini toasts made from the in-house focaccia, a tablespoonful of fragrant acacia honeycomb. I couldnrsquot buy these ingredients in a shop for this price.We polish off the tiramisugrave in seconds, that often tedious dessert, which is rather compelling here. Nearly liquied, thin sponge floats on powerful espresso, under a thin creamy froth punctuated by fatty curds of mascarpone cheese.

If we have the chance to do so through another EU referendum we should grasp that opportunity.ldquoBut there is no doubt whatsoever that the utter chaos of Brexit from the Tory party has strengthened the case for Scotland taking its future into its own hands through independence. We cannot go on like this with Scotlandrsquos interests ignored at every turn."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-why-is-scottish-labour-determined-to-let-down-scotland","story":"When the Tories spoke about Scotlandrsquos best interests being protected by the Union you sensed they actually believed this heart and soul. The word Unionist is included in the full title of their party and the historic privileges enjoyed by them and the cultural constituency they represented have all indeed flourished when Westminsterrsquos writ has run in its four constituent parts.This is not to say that they are anything less than fully Scottish, just that they believe Scotlandrsquos destiny to be forever entwined with the UK. Itrsquos merely one among many declarations of what it means to be Scottish and none the less valid for that and is characterised chiefly by an historic affectionnot love for what they understand Britishness to be.Thus, there was an honesty and integrity about the Scottish Toriesrsquo opposition to independence that was absent in much of the campaigning of Scottish Labour chiefs and their water-carriers on social media. This seemed to be fuelled less by any great love for the Union than by an implacable malevolence ndash sometimes approaching outright hatred ndash towards anything sponsored by the SNP. At times you formed an impression thatScottish independence was being proposed by wee green men emerging from a spaceship they would receive a fairer hearing in some Labour circles than anyone sporting a yellow and black rosette.The seeds of such bitterness were probably sewn in hundreds of Westminster and electoral campaigns keenly contested and with a signicant degree of rancour with the SNP. On these occasions it wasnrsquot the Tories who were threatening their influence and privileges but the SNP, even though they may have shared largely similar social agendas. Many simply couldnrsquot stomach the possibility of permitting what would be the ultimate triumph of the SNP evenit meant ignoring what their instincts were telling them: that Westminster was beginning to favour options for the rich in its economic policies and to re-direct any resultant working-class bitterness in the direction of immigrants.Even the most reactionary of Tory governments come to power on the back of working class votes. For this to occur, they must always have an assortment of familiar phantoms and usual suspects to hand and these must be leveraged by calls to national unity and security or the echoes of empire. Any notions Scottish Labour might have entertained about de-coupling from such a polity were swamped by antagonism towards the wretched SNP. They also fashioned a  narrative to conceal such narrow animosity. Thus, the lie that the referendum was nasty and isive and that Yes supporters despised the English became the distinguishing feature of their campaign.It was probably this, as much as anything , that formed the tipping point for many Labour supporters who, having signalled their rejection of such a dishonest narrative, were subsequently marginalised and made to feel like aliens in their own party. None of them have since ed to the Labour fold and this, more than anything  is why Labour in Scotland is a spent force with no immediate prospect of recovery.Foolishly, Richard Leonard, Labourrsquos latest leader in Scotland, continues to oppose independence while exhibiting no shred of original thinking on policy that might make his party attractive once more to the tens of thousands of its former supporters who have abandoned it.As Westminster takes a two-week holiday while the clock ticks towards a No-deal Brexit nothing in the behaviour of Labourrsquos UK leadership has done anything to inspire confidence either. In the last seven days Irsquove asked several Labour supporters to describe their partyrsquos Brexit strategy. No two answers were the same and all were marked by confusion. Any empathy they had previously felt with Jeremy Corbynrsquos policies on social justice has evaporated, largely on the perception that he has been found grievously wanting on this the biggest political issue of their lives. No leadership, no consistency, no courage and no conviction are the unorm verdict of Mr Corbynrsquos lamentable last two weeks at Westminster. By contrast, Theresa May, even in these her darkest dayshas displayed all of these attributes.The spectre of a No-deal Brexit now looms large and with it the real threat, which the UK Government has now admitted, of civil disorder. These and the exposure of Mr Corbynrsquos failure of leadership will test the propaganda unit of the Better Together campaign during the second referendum on Scottish independence.Once, it might have been a valid argument to insist that in a time of national crisis we must pull in the same direction. Butyou have been ignored and treated with contempt as Scotlandrsquos Government and Scotlandrsquos parliament have been in their efforts to help get a decent Brexit or even to mitigate its worst effects then such appeals are rendered worthless and hollow.In  Westminsterrsquos lurch towards reactionary and socially isive policies tipped many of us towards an independent Scotland. Such a hard right agenda also seemed to act as an accelerant for darker elements with racist agendas. More than four years later the England that many of us loved and admired is on the verge of capitulating to these forces and it looks like UK Labour has been fighting them with a peashooter.When it comes time to have our second referendum ndash and we will have it ndash there will be a moral dimension to consider for those who previously voted No and this will outweigh everything . For by this time Brexit and its process will have destroyed their once cherished economic arguments and their warnings of social ision."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9207711.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fast-fashion-in-the-firing-line","story":"Fast fashion has become a byword in the industry for sparkly dresses, smart shirts and t-shirts which sell for buttons up and down the high street.Yet now there is a growing weight of evidence the prevalence of clothing so cheap it can be easily disposed of is harming the environment - and adding to the dangers of global warming.And experts and campaigners are warning shoppers not to add to the pile as Scotland gets into the swing of the party season and the rush of last-minute Christmas gt-giving.Recent research on the textile industry has found that it accounts for  per cent - .bn tonnes - of global greenhouse gas emissions.:Fast-fashion can be just as durable as designer brands, says academicThe UK play a large part in this, consuming almost kg of new clothing per head per year compared to only  kg in France.Global clothing production has doubled since , and it takes  gallons of water to make  t shirt, the equivalent of  yearsrsquo drinking water for your average person.Politicians are now urging people to think of more sustainable options for their wardrobes, to help cut down on waste.Labours Environment spokesperson Claudia Beamish said: ldquoThe festive season is the time to get your glad rags on and you may look to fashion for presents for loved ones.ldquoMany of us are used to being mindful about recycling Christmas cards and wrapping paper ndash but we are more blaseacute about fast fashion and textile waste.

This is what I said:ldquoItrsquos friendship and memory, wonderful moments and the emotions that go with them ndash the perfect partner to unforgettable events in all our lives.ldquoIt is the heady night my first daughter was born, when I arrived home from hospital and poured an Old Fettercairn to make a joyful, tearful toast to my we and tiny new baby.ldquoOr the bright May evening outside the Kingrsquos House in Glen Coe after my friend and I had climbed Agagrsquos Groove on the Buachaille Etive Mor.

That is, at the absolute basic, the essence of whisky.People often say that something is greater than the sum of its parts ndash well, that phrase could have been coined especially for Scotlandrsquos national drink.Since I first fell in love with whisky in , Irsquove been lucky enough to try some unforgettable drams ... including one or two whose price tag ran into five figures.But over the years itrsquos become clear to me that you donrsquot have to pay thousands ndash or even hundreds ndash to get your hands on something really special.If you know what yoursquore looking for you can find a spectacular dram on a supermarket shelf or in your local whisky shop, and you certainly wonrsquot need to spend as much as you think.Over the following four pages, Irsquove listed a few of my favourites ndash some of the most interesting and exciting whiskies around today.

It boasts a depth of flavour that belies its youth ndash a heady mix of sweetness and citric sharpness, but with the richness of dried fruits and a satisfying biscuity creaminess. Far off there are hints of pepper and the odd waft of smoke. Yum!The  AD continues parent company Adelphirsquos pioneering use of blockchain to give unique levels of provenance to every bottle. By scanning the unique QR code on the back label, consumers can trace every ingredient and every stage of the ldquomanufacturing process, from field to bottle.And,yoursquore still not convinced, just look at the bottle.

When he handed the Glenkinchie to me he said: ldquoLook for the ice cream.And when I drank it, it was there, coating my mouth and at the back of my tongue hellip and I was hooked!Nowadays, Irsquod say therersquos far more to this dram than hints of vanilla and a lemon cheesecake creaminess. In fact, I think that for a Lowland malt ndash itrsquos distilled just outside Edinburgh ndash it has a wonderful richness and depth, and it really stands scrutiny against the biggest guns of Speyside, and some of the great Highland malts.Add to that a lovely natural, almost herbal note and you have a dram that really is one to remember.www.maltsArran The Bothy Quarter Cask Batch ABV: .%Price: pound.They say the Isle of Arran is Scotland in Miniature. But, believe me, therersquos nothing miniatureabout this fantastic dram from a lovely distillery in the north of the island.It packs as impressive a punch as any expresssion Irsquove tried over the years.As you can guess from the name, this is the fourth release of the Quarter Cask. Each one so far has been an absolute winner, and this is no dferent.The idea is simple: take the usual Arran whisky and, for the last  months of its maturation, move it into smaller casks ndash yes, you guessed it, a quarter the size of the original and made of American Oak.This allows far greater contact between whisky and wood, resulting in a faster, more intense maturation.The result is an absolutetreat ndash rich and powerful with tonsof vanilla sweetness and peppery spice. Itrsquos fruity and fresh, but at the same time really luxurious.This is a real star in a brilliant range. The distillery is well worth a visit too ndash the scones are amazing!www.arranwhiskyKilchoman SanaigABV: %Price: poundSpeed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing, over the sea to Skye.

Sometimes itrsquos about something thatrsquos far more simple.Sometimes, when you smell it, it transports you somewhere  ndash to a memory or a favourite place.For me, this -year-old Benromach does just that. It takes me back to when I was young, six or seven, maybe, to a time when we lived in an old house, with a big open fire, and we used to sit there of an evening ndash it would have been about this time of year ndash roasting marshmallows.I can smell the fire ndash not a roaring one, but mellow embers with the odd little puff of smoke. I can taste the rich toffee-sweetness of the melting marshmallows.But, therersquos something  too ndash is that Jamaica ginger cake  Not homemade, but the sticky one out of the packet.

And itrsquos still the one Irsquoll go forI see it on a menu after dinner at a hotel.Caol Ilais a Muhammad Ali of a dram hellip it dances around, all lightness and fruit itrsquos fascinating and mesmerising.But at some point or other, you just know itrsquos going to knock you out with a wonderful smack of smoke.It starts off light and refined, with fresh herbal notes and hints of damp grass, but then the coastal smokiness really kicks in ndash not unlike hot-smoked salmon. Itrsquos full-bodied and has a long, warming finish.As you add water, a wonderful freshness ndash much like Ardbeg ndash takes over, making this a hugely satisfying dram.www.maltsOld Particular Cameronbridge -year-oldABV: .%Price: poundWe couldnrsquot let a list of brilliant whiskies go without including a single-grain. And what better place to find one than at legendary Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing The Cameronbridge isnrsquot exactly blessed with the beautul surroundings of Strathisla or Glengoyne, or the rugged backdrop of Dalwhinnie ndash it sits in Fersquos industrial heartland, just a stonersquos throw from Methil and Leven.It may not have had the most romantic of beginnings, but this Cameronbridge is a real ndash and rare ndash treat.In my mind, the defining characteristic of single-grain whiskies is cream, and this expression is awash with it.In fact, when you smell it, therersquos almost an aroma oftoffee sauce ndash salted caramel mixed with all that cream, but with a bit of honey thrown in for good measure.You could almost pour it on your sponge pudding.Therersquos cakiness too ndash in fact, this is more like a big, rich sharing dessert than a dram.Now, wherersquos my spoon  I want another helping .www.douglaslaingcomOld Pulteney -year-oldABV: %Price: poundIf anyone ever says that whisky isnrsquot a product of its surroundings, this is definitely a dram to make them change their mind.Itrsquos made in Wick, and its warehouses are exposed to the full force of the North Sea.This gives the whisky a wonderful coastal, salty personality ndash and once you get to know it, you can recognise it anywhere.But donrsquot think this dram is harsh in any way at all. The -year-old is aged entirely in bourbon casks, and this gives the finished product a wonderful richness and sweetness ndash and the distinctive vanilla that is always there when bourbon casks are used.Look for vanilla, tablet and almost burnt sugar on the nose, with a flavour balancing chocolate and toffee indulgence with citrusy fruit and that coastal tang.This level of quality is great value at pound, but be aware that Old Pulteneyis regularly on offer ndash I think itrsquos pound in Tesco right now, and at that price itrsquos a steal.www.oldpulteneyKilkerran -year-oldABV: %Price: poundBefore we start, letrsquos take a moment to thank Kilkerran ndash because the distillery where itrsquos made, Glengyle, effectively saved Campbeltownrsquos status as a whisky region.After many years of only having two distilleries, Springbank and Glen Scotia, it was deemed that Campbeltown could no longer be classed as a region.However, when Glengyle was resurrected ndash it was an old distillery that closed in the s but was brought back to le in  ndash the three operational distilleries could maintain their status.And just as well, as Campbeltown malts are unique ndash robust, oily and bursting with character ndash and this Kilkerran -year-old is certainly a classic of its kind.Itrsquos oaky and slightly peaty, but super-rich, sweet and velvety smooth at the same time. And, of course, therersquos the oiliness and saltiness yoursquod expect from a Campbeltown dram.This whisky was only launched in , but it surely deserves its place among the true greats of this amazing region.All hail Kilkerran ndash you are indeed a hero!kilkerran.scotMacallan -year-old Double CaskABV: %Price: poundThe Macallan has been looking a million dollars lately hellip literally. One of its bottles ndash a -year-old distilled in  ndash broke that mad, seven-figure barrier just a few weeks ago, but far more importantlythe distillery moved house hellip to possibly the most beautully perfect building I have ever seen.So, as the year draws to a close, I was pretty sure my impression of this superbrand couldnrsquot get any more positive hellip until I tasted the Double Cask.Much of my whisky journey has been a hunt for the dferent and the new, but when I come back to a dram like The Macallan and its perfect richness, I remember therersquos a reason why this is a worldwide favourite.The Double Cask uses whisky aged in barrels of both American and European ex-sherry oak to take the spirit to a whole new level.Therersquos the classic dried fruit. Itrsquos creamy and you can almost see the drops of honey. But therersquos the sweet sharpness of marmalade and almost the spiced luxury of a cinnamon pastry.A finish of vanilla and more sweet fruit and I have only one challenge on my mind as we end .Go on Macallan, I dare you ndash top that next year.www.themacallanArdbeg An OaABV: .%Price: poundTo me, Ardbeg is about only one thing ndash itrsquos what identies it the minute I stick my nose in the glass.Smoke ndash pure, perfect, wood-embers smoke.And the An Oa ndash launched last year as the first addition to Ardbegrsquos core range for more than a decade ndash doesnrsquot disappoint.Itrsquos there in spades, mixed with a wonderful cocktail of cakey sweetness and butterscotch richness. Therersquos a luxurious creaminess in the background too, just in case you didnrsquot get just how special this dram really is.Then,you add water therersquos another treat in store ndash something I donrsquot understand from such a peaty whisky, but which I always look for in an Ardbeg.The peaty oomph remains, but something  appears ndash the most wonderful freshness. Itrsquos like a summer breeze blowing through freshly washed linen just hung out to dry on a line by the sea.If you like peaty whisky, you really canrsquot go wrong with Ardbeg, but this was the first time Irsquod tried the An Oa.Time to rewrite my whisky wish-list, I think!www.ardbegGordon  MacPhail Discovery Bunnahabhain -year-oldABV: %Price: poundThere are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that take a barrowload of peat and stuff it down your throat ndash and there are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that tone things down, some a teeny bit, some a lot. For me, Bunnahabhain sits in the second camp hellip and itrsquos all the better for it.So when Gordon  MacPhail ndash one of the countryrsquos small band of legendary independent bottlers ndash gets hold of an already interesting dram, itrsquos time to take notice.This Discovery expression ndash part of a wider range from around the country ndash is rich and exciting, with dried fruit and sherry on the nose, and hints of spice, rich vanilla and orange. Itrsquos super- smooth, and as you taste it the initial spice morphs into more richness of dates and plums. At the finish, therersquos chocolate ndash maybe not milky bar, but definitely not bitter dark ndash and more fruits.The bottlerrsquos art is a critical part of the whisky firmament ndash they hunt out interesting casks and, when they find them they bottle them. Soyou see a bottlerrsquos version of one of our favourites, go for it ndash you will definitely be in for a memorable voyage of Discovery.gordonandmacphailNaked GrouseABV: %Price: poundAs I said in the introduction to this whole article,yoursquore after something truly memorable, you really donrsquot have to spend a fortune to get it hellipyou know where to look.

The bleak splendour of Drumochter and Dalwhinnie are miles behind the Cairngorms and Aviemore are a rapidly fading memory. Inverness isnrsquot far off, and from there itrsquos on to the wild lands of Ross and Caithness.Yoursquod expect a whisky here to have ruggedness its heart ndash to be as unforgiving as a northern winter. But no, not a bit of it. The climate round here is softer and more gentle than you might imagine ndash and the spirit thatrsquos born from this land reflects that.The Tomatin -year-old is smooth and silky, with a rich, fruity aroma coming from its traditional mix of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. Itrsquos buttery at first, but there are also notes of marzipan. The flavours are powerful, but therersquos sweetness and richness, with oaky vanilla, ripe apples and pears. Hints of stem ginger and citrus add a tangy treat.Soyou ever thought the Highlands were bleak, think again. All you need to do is stop a while, look around you, and yoursquoll find a real gem hidden in the north.www.tomatinDouglas Laingrsquos Remarkable Regional MaltsABV: VariousPrice: From pound to poundI could choose one from this range, but really, therersquos no point. Quite simply,you try one you really should try them all, because theyrsquore as good a lesson in the dferent characteristics of Scotlandrsquos whisky regions as yoursquoll ever need. Theyrsquore a ready-made whisky collection.There are six names to look out for, and each blends together some of the best malts from its region to capture the unique character of each area.The fun, light Epicurean is the lowland offering, while rich,complex Speyside is represented by Scallywag.If you head into the Highlands, look out for Timorous Beastie, and slightly peated, slightly salty Rock Oyster is a island-inspired tidal wave.If yoursquore into a dram from Islay or Skye, why not try Big Beat , while the newest addition to the range,The Gauldrons, captures the unique, excellent power of Campbeltown.The range was launched with ldquobasic versions, but since then it has grown, and a host of special editions and extra expressions have turned these Regional Malts into a veritable reference library of whisky.So put on your reading glasses, pull up a chair and get studying. You will be tested at the end of the lesson.www.douglaslaingOld Pulteney HuddartABV: %Price: poundThis is a strange experience. Old Pulteney has been a favourite of mine for many, many years, but trying the Huddart ndash released just this year and named after the street in which the distillery sits ndash was like meeting the younger sister of my best pal that I didnrsquot know existed.I recognise her immediately, but at the same time shersquos so dferent from the friend I know and love.The Huddart is definitely an Old Pulteney ndash the saltiness and drtwood-on-a-beach coastal personality tell us that ndash but itrsquos been finished in casks which previously held peated whisky, and this gives it a wonderful far-off smokiness that adds a layer of real intensity to an already powerful dram.But therersquos a ton of richness too, with sweet vanilla balancing the intensity of smoke, and I loved the buttery, mouth-coating finish. This is definitely one to come back to on a cold, stormy night when I have some time on my hands, and the music player to myself. Van Morrison, I think.Huddart, itrsquos been a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting.

More than , young people were at the heart of it, and planned a calendar of sporting, music and cultural events for all ages to enjoy.A world-first initiative, Year of Young People was a commitment made by the Scottish Government. Young people worked alongside decision makers to make sure they were involved in the creation of government policy. This year, they established a Youth Commission which examines mental health services. They will have a greater say in their education with the creation of a Scottish Learner Panel, and will hold those in power to account with the launch of the First Minister’s Question Time for children and young people.YoYP was delivered in partnership with local and national organisations including schools, youth work services, EventScotland , Young Scot, Scottish Youth Parliament, Children in Scotland and YouthLink Scotland.More than  young ambassadors volunteered their time to challenge the negative stereotypes of their peers. Their role is to represent their local area, promote activities and showcase the positive contributions young people make to their local community.Orkney’s Hope Laing was one of those who volunteered to be a young ambassador. She said: “Year of Young People has given Scotland an opportunity to build young people’s reputation, and provide more opportunities for them to influence and take action. “I am very proud that I have been one of the ambassadors for my area, and being involved in helping young people shine in my local community.“A few highlights are: Stromness Drama Club winning the National Youth Festival Estrella, on their amazing Young Enterprise Venture which won three awards at the Young Enterprise Finals and their Managing Director, who has been announced as Young Entrepreneur of the Year!“One group which I am part of, the West Mainland Youth Achievement Group, had success this year competing in the MoneyforLe scheme.

The appeal ends at the end of the year.Donations forms have been published in The Orcadian over the appeal, with donations also accepted online at: www.gofundme longhope-leboat-museumThe trust can also be contacted via email: longhope@gmailcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Incredibly, the pound target was smashed within days, hundreds of complete strangers inspired by his determination amongst the backers.Speaking to the Ross-shire Journal this week, he said: \"Since getting access to the best facilities and coaches, my performance has improved and Im getting personal bests. Cycling in front of a home crowd in London was just so much fun ndash the noise was ridiculous and I just didnt want to come off the track.\"He powered through the km four-lap race in m s, pipped by just a fraction of a second by the reigning world champion.Fin, who needs a leg brace to race, was quick to thank those who have shown faith in him, not least parents Dee and Drew who have backed his dream from the start and driven him thousands of miles around the country to compete. \"Without them, none of this would have happened,\" he said. \"They were able to come down to London to watch, which was very special.\"After being invited to talk to pupils at his former school, Fin said he shared his highs and lows and spoke of the importance of setting a target ndash even amidst setbacks such as his illness.A spokesman at Dingwall Academy said: \"Effort, resilience, embracing challenge, listening to feedback, never giving up and learning from failures were all great messages.\"His mum Dee, a childrens nurse, earlier told the Journal: \"We have no idea what the future holds.

Most cash was paid to Scottish wind farms, with some earning more than £m a month for not supplying power.Whitelee and its extension on the outskirts of Glasgow, the biggest onshore wind farm in the UK, has received almost a fth of the entire pot since , with payments totalling more than £m to date.Meanwhile, the MW Clyde scheme, near Abington in South Lanarkshire, has raked in more than £m and the Grfin, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire, nearly £m. The amount paid out has been rising annually, despite a new transmission cable to export power from Scotland south of the Border.The fees, known as constraint payments, are paid for by households across the UK.Anti-wind campaigners say spending on constraints has got “completely out of control”, and described expansion of the industry as “reckless”.Lyndsey Ward, who lives in the Highlands, said: “The constraints situation is completely out of control. The Scottish Government is recklessly approving more and more turbines to be connected to a grid that has little hope of managing any power they produce. “The result is an ever-increasing number of turbines have to be switched off and it is the consumer who pays. “Industry also has the wind costs on their energy bills and they add that on to the goods and services they sell us.” The £. billion Western Link interconnector, which became operational last year, runs  miles underwater from Hunterston in Ayrshire to Connah’s Quay in North Wales.It was hoped by exporting power to England and Wales the cable would cut levels of compensation paid to energy firms when Scottish turbines have to be shut down because supply outstrips demand.But faults have seen the cable – a joint project between network operators National Grid and Scottish Power Transmission – unable to operate at full capacity until last month.So far there seems no reduction in payouts compared to the same time last year.Dr John Constable is director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity which first exposed constraint payments to wind generators and publishes data on the costs.He said: “No-one expected the Western Link to be a complete solution to wind power constraint costs, but the continuing level of payments is strikingly high – £m in November, £.m in December so far – raising the question as to whether this very expensive interconnector represents value for money.”Energy regulator Ofgem approved the Western Link project following a cost-benefit analysis that showed it would reduce consumer bills.A spokeswoman for National Grid said: “The Western Link project is playing a vital role in reinforcing the existing UK transmission system … The project is in the early days of operation but will signicantly reduce the levels of constraint payments being made to wind generators.” A spokesman for Ofgem added: “Ofgem sets National Grid, as electricity system operator, strong financial incentives to manage constraint costs efficiently. Overall these costs are less than  per cent of a typical household electricity bill.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847378.1545391589!/image/image.jpg","title":"funding injection for smart central heating project","story":"East Lothian-based thermal energy storage specialist Sunamp and energy supplier OVO have secured seven-figure funding to develop a commercially viable smart central heating system.The project brings together OVO’s intelligent energy management , called VCharge, with Sunamp’s super compact “heat batteries” which are said to store four times more heat than hot water tanks of a similar size.The firms have received £. million of grant funding from the UK government’s Low Carbon Heating Technology Fund for their collaborative zero carbon home project.Andrew Bissell, chief executive of Macmerry-based Sunamp, said: “It’s a fact that  per cent of energy used in UK homes is for heating and we are delighted to team up with the UK’s leading independent energy supplier and bring our UniQ heat batteries together with OVO’s Time of Use technology.“We aim to develop an accessible heating solution to deliver heating and hot water on demand and improve levels of comfort and lower fuel costs, energy consumption and carbon emissions in homes everywhere.”Toby Ferenczi, director of strategy at OVO, said: “Replacing a gas boiler with a smart electric system is the most practical and low-cost way to decarbonise heating.“By combining VCharge and Sunamp’s UniQ heat batteries, power can be drawn down according to the needs of the grid, resulting in running costs comparable to gas heating systems but without carbon emissions.“We are excited to work with Sunamp to develop this game-changing smart electric heat solution.”Energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said: “By replacing fossil fuels with smart heating systems we have the potential to cut carbon emissions and save consumers money on their heating bills.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847903.1545470140!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn says brexit would go ahead if labour won snap election","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would continue with Brexitit won a snap general election in the new year.The opposition leader told thehe would “go back and negotiate and see what the timetable would be” with BrusselsTheresa May triggered a vote and lost, thrusting his party into power.Meanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker’s behaviour towards women has been “grotesque” after the former Luxembourg prime minister played with a woman’s hair at a European Council meeting.Mr Corbyn told the paper that he would advocate Brexitthere was a second referendum on the issue, and attacked the bloc over its rules on state aid and competition.He told the : “I think the state aid rules do need to be looked at again, because quite clearly,you want to regenerate an economy, as we would want to do in government, then I don’t want to be told by somebody  that we can’t use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country.”Asked about Labour’s positionthere was a fresh popular vote, he told the paper: “It would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.”Ms Rudd, who backed Remain in the referendum, launched a scathing attack on Mr Juncker, labelling him “ghastly”.Mr Juncker and Mrs May were caught on camera having a robust discussion the day after Mr Juncker used a press conference to describe her negotiating strategy as “nebulous”.Ms Rudd replaced Esther McVey at the Department for Work and Pensions a month ago, having been sacked as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal.In a wide-ranging interview, which will fuel speculation she has leadership ambitions, the Hastings MP was asked about Mr Juncker.She said: “ ghastly.

This is a month noted for its joie de vivre, bonhomie and what the German language, with typical economy, calls Weinachteneinkäuferwartung . It is signicant, perhaps, that the English language has no specic noun for the state of mind that settles on many of us during this special month. This state is marked by a niggling desire to get away – anywhere – in order to escape the state of mind that appears to affecting others.For some, the first appearance of Christmas lights is the signal that things are about to go downhill. In Edinburgh, this happens now in September, immediately after the Edinburgh Festival. This is in accordance with the desire of our local tourism promoters – a couthie lot – to inflict festivals on the long-suffering inhabitants of this city  , as the expression has it, and, indeed,  . For this, many feel they should be awarded  . But that is another subject, and it is too depressing to talk about it in a month during which we are all so spontaneously cheerful. The Reverend I.M. Jolly we most certainly are not.However, one feature of December that is genuinely enjoyable is the Christmas letter that people like to send their friends and relatives round about now. These are wonderful things to receive, and who does not feel a certain disappointment when they open a Christmas card and find that it contains nothing but good wishes for Christmas and the New Year  There is no point in sending others such thin fare: of course they have such wishes for you, and it would be odd,not actually hurtful,they were not to harbour such thoughts. By contrast, finding a cyclostyled letter within is a bonus, and sets the heart racing with anticipation.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downAn important thing to understand about these letters is that they give an opportunity to boast, usually about one’s offspring. Usually this involves exam results, which form, on average, about half the content of a Christmas letter. When it comes to Highers and A levels and such things, people have no shame in trumpeting them loudly in the seasonal letter. Indeed, I have heard that the SQA, which controls exam results, is seriously thinking of withholding their release until December each year in order to ensure their topicality for Christmas letters. This is a helpful suggestion, although it may complicate university admission, which of course is another very fitting topic for the Christmas letter.What you should do in this respect is mention exam results indirectly. Don’t say Jane got nine As in her exams this year. That is clearly boastful and in bad taste. Rather, you should write, “Janeis still a bit worried about her university admission. I have assured her that anyone who gets nineA grades in her Advanced Highers has no need to worry, but does she listen to me  You know how children are!” Other family achievements should not be forgotten, and should all be referred to in a good Christmas letter. Once again, insert the information indirectly, as in this example: “We all went to Rome this year and had a wonderful time. The Pope looks so much younger, you know, when you see him close up. I mean, really close up, in his private study.” That conveys, in a very tactful way, the message you wish to convey. Then you might add, “We were a bit nervous of course, as this is the first time that we have had a direct experience of the beatication of a close relative . But it was such a simple, rather moving ceremony and we had a lovely dinner afterwards in a modest trattoria ...”: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee If you received an OBE or similar award this year, do not mention it directly. The following form of words will suffice: “We couldn’t get away in July, as planned, as I had to go down to London– just for the morning – what a bind!” If you went to the Garden Party, then the only way of conveying that information is to say something like this: “My goodness, it was a battle getting into my morning suitin July. There I was enjoying my statutory cucumber sandwich under the gaze of Arthur’s Seat, thinking of the strict diet ahead!” No more than that is necessary.All heavy colds and injuries must be mentioned. The attachment of a small photograph of an X-ray plate is optional. That, believe it or not, really was in a Christmas letter we received a few years ago. The fracture was an interesting one.

But he also reserved time for a thinly-veiled critique of the  SNP MPs at Westminster.: Would an independent Scotland face a hard border with England In conclusion to a maritime-themed analogy, in which he described Mrs May as “a barnacle clinging desperately to the hull”, Mr Salmond said: “Even the Scottish contingent seems unsure as to when, or even whether, to launch our Caledonian leboat and chart our own course for the continent.”“In fact, the only parliamentmentary group which appears secure and determined in their objectives are the Democratic Unionists. Speaking in the show’s closing monologe, Mr Salmond added: “Parliament should now take advantage of the Scottish ruling from the European Court of Justice and instruct the Government to revoke Article . This would allow the time and space for either a general election or a renewed referendum, or even just a rationale discussion to break the deadlock and chart a way forward, free from the looming clf edge. As we say in Scotland - that would make for a guid new year.”An SNP spokesman said: “The fact of the matter is this – an alternative must be found to the PM’s  choice of a bad deal which lacks support, or a bad deal which would spell disaster for jobs and living standards.“The SNP is the only party showing true leadership by knocking heads together and making the case for a better way forward.“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in Europe. If we have the chance to do so through another EU referendum we should grasp that opportunity.“But there is no doubt whatsoever that the utter chaos of Brexit from the Tory party has strengthened the case for Scotland taking its future into its own hands through independence.

What followed has been the stuff of dreams.Back in , as the debate over Scotland’s constitutional future became ever more fractious, I grew accustomed to receiving some fairly unpleasant messages and Tweets from keyboard warriors who saw my scepticism about the SNP’s proposal as a matter of considerable treachery. Often they’d want to know what I was being paid to espouse the views I didand, when they were referring to my trade, they’d be sure to put the word journalist inside inverted commas, lest anyone be in any doubt that the truth was I was nothing more than a shill.Every day, I’d block dozens of accounts – ,, at the last count – and get on with my “so-called” “journalism”. But when the owner of an account by the name of @ropoem popped up on my timeline to challenge something I’d written, he stood out. Unlike my usual correspondents from the Yes side of the tracks, he was polite and playful.And so I followed him back and enjoyed our little exchanges, which never ended in agreement but always passed in good humour. Occasionally, I’d wonder who this guy was we seemed, politics aside, to have a lot in common. I’d wonder, too, what he made of me. Before long, I was to find out exactly who he was and, it turns out, he thinks I’m not so bad.In , the owner of my local video rental place bought a job lot of ”singles that had previously been used in jukeboxes. There were boxes and boxes of the things, which he knocked out at p each or a quid for three. To a -year-old music fan of limited means, this was a treasure trove. Over a period of months, I bought dozens of s – among them such classics as Rip it Up by Orange Juice, Werewolves Of London by Warren Zevon and  Carat Love Affair by The Associates – that I cherish still. When the stock on display ran low, the shopkeeper would produce yet more boxes containing yet more gems and, thus, one Saturday afternoon I walked out of his place with three recent hit singles – Cath, I’m Falling, and Young At Heart – by The Bluebells. What a magnicent score.These records – I’m Falling, especially – have remained great favourites of mine throughout the ensuing decades. I know them intimately yet they retain the power to thrill me.So when a friend emailed me in  to say he’d noticed I seemed to be getting on pretty well online with Bobby Bluebell, I was surprised and delighted. This @ropoem bloke, it turned out, was the songwriting genius behind some of my favourite records.An invitation to watch The Bluebells play in Glasgow a few days after the independence referendum followed, and when Bobby dedicated Young At Heart to me from the stage, I was fully smitten.I can be awkward with new people but Bobby and I slipped into an easy friendship, opening up about times good and bad, and enthusing about the music we loved.Perhaps I was being a little cocky, \u2028but when my mate Kenny, a drummer, and I, a sort-of guitar player, began renting out a rehearsal room in Edinburgh to make a racket, I invited Bobby along,he wasn’t doing anything , mind, and it was okayhe couldn’t make it.Not only did he make it, but he gave generously, patiently listening to scraps of music I’d written, to half-realised rfs, and offering gentle and wise guidance. Usually, this would entail him suggesting the removal of unnecessary noodling and the focus on the essence of the song. I may have been a know-it-all newspaper columnist but I was a know-nothing novice songwriter and here was someone who’d written for some of the biggest names in popular music – he’s written for Brian Wilson, for heaven’s sake – acting as my mentor. Soon, I was in not one but two groups with Bobby. Last year, our group Best Picture released their first single, Isabelle, and last week our other band, Fat Cops, released their debut, Hands Up! Get Down!, a song written by Bobby, the band’s keyboard player Neil Murray, and me. It was named single of the week by BBC Radio Scotland’s Afternoon Show. Proud  You bet.For someone who bought his first single in  and still buys them, these have been truly magical moments. And underpinning these developments is a friendship that came out of the blue. Bobby and I still disagree about politics, of course, but the circumstances of our meeting act as a constant reminder in these horribly turbulent times that political disagreement needn’t be a barrier to an enduring human connection.On  March, , Fat Cops’ debut LP will be released. We’re proud of it. It’s better than any of us – Bobby, Neil, Chris, Bass Chris, Al and I – imagined it might be and we’re looking forward to playing gigs to promote it.

But the party has also left open the option of supporting a second referendum.But Corbyn saidhe becomes Prime Minister he would “go back and negotiate and see what the timetable would be” with Brussels.Asked about Labour’s positionthere was a fresh popular vote, he told the paper: “It would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be, but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.”Last week Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said that a second referendum could be the most plausible scenariothe Commons rejects May’s deal and cannot agree an alternative.A cross-party coalition of opposition parties at Westminster, including the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru, back a so-called People’s Vote.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Corbyn “refuses once again to take the blinkers off”.He added: “He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.“On Brexit, you simply cannot put a cigarette paper between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847924.1545485477!/image/image.jpg","title":"rail chiefs defend pay rise for scotrail boss amid performance criticism","story":"Rail chiefs have defended a  per cent pay increase for the head of the ScotRail Alliance with Network Rail despite its poor performance.Managing director Alex Hynes’s salary increased by £, from £, to £,, it has emerged.However, Network Rail, which employs Mr Hynes, said his increase was in line with everyone  at the UK Government body.This year, ScotRail’s punctuality has fallen to its worst for  years, although the latest figures showed an improvement for the first time for three months.Scottish ministers have said  per cent of the delays have been caused by Network Rail faults, such as to track and signalling.Network Rail said media reports of a “bumper pay rise” were untrue because the Cabinet Office had miscoded Mr Hynes pay band.A spokesman said: “Alex got a  per cent pay rise- in line with everyone  at NR - and his salary is now £k, up from £k.”But Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association, said: “Alex was the highest paid public servant in Scotland when he started and he’s now presiding over the biggest failure in public service in Scotland.“He should waive future pay increases until ScotRail performs better, to show passengers he’s on their side.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead. I just hope the changes are for the better of the collective rather than for the few    #I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.# O dear dear me, it is all a wicked capitalist conspiracy.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Niahm-Morrison-10-Loch-Duich-primary-winner.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated. The work includes a new social area and ICT room, plus innovative youth mental health rooms for the Flare Project.Work began to transform the centre in March, with some staff working out of the Waveney Youth Centre, and young people only being able to use a small section of the building.From June of this year the centre has been closed to facilitate the refurbishment, therefore young people and staff were really looking forward to getting back to the building.Many young people rely on the youth centre on a daily basis.Running clubs and activities five nights of the week, around  youths use the facilities. Monday and Friday nights are for nine to twelve year olds, while Tuesday and Thursdays are the senior nights for teenagers.On Wednesday the centre is available for all on their split night.Run by the Education Authority Youth Service, the centre is a valued part of the community and provides important le skill training for young people, as well as providing them with activities.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Our business and domestic rate payers deserve it. “It is imperative that we invest in our town centres to make them a vibrant and attractive place to live, work, shop and do business.”, Emma Harrison, Pearl Sibanda and Lauren Graham with Anne Kerr from the British Psychology Society and Mrs L Duke .\"  , Emma Harrison, Pearl Sibanda and Lauren Graham with Anne Kerr from the British Psychology Society and Mrs L Duke .\"  Pupils investigate the ‘Power of Unorm’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8745017.1545218388!/image/image.jpg","title":"double celebrations for stuffabusni toy collection","story":"Thanks to the generosity of the Northern Ireland public, thousands of children living in poverty across the province will receive presents this Christmas.For the second year in a row, Translink and U joined forces for the Stuff a Bus Toy Appeal, in aid of The Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dups emma pengelly reminds academic she has arts degree from ulster university","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Statue of Liberty was still open for tours, thanks to money from New York state, and the US Post Office was still delivering mail, as an independent agency.Yet the disruption has affected many government operations and the routines of , federal employees.

Absent from the guest list were Republican leaders or any Democrats, who would be needed for a deal.“I am in the White House, working hard,” tweeted the president, who cancelled his Florida holiday getaway to his club Mar-a-Lago due to the shutdown.

He has given mixed messages on whether he would sign any bill into law.After the luncheon at the White House, Senator Lindsey Graham said, “It’s clear to me he believes the additional funding is necessary.”Senators approved a bipartisan deal earlier in the week to keep the government open into February and provide . billion dollarsfor border security projects, but not the wall. But as Mr Trump faced criticism from conservatives for “caving” on a campaign promise, he pushed to House to approve a package temporarily financing the government but also setting aside . billion

nurses helped save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the

will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him. One way or another, I would be interested to hear from anyone who saw him recently.KILLYLEAGH mdash Mr David Watson thought he had fought his last battle with the end of World War  mdash but he was wrong. Mr Watson, who is  and probably one of Killyleaghrsquos oldest residents, has been fighting a gruelling battle with the Housing Executive to obtain a house without stairs.At his Comber Road home Mr Watson and his  year-old we, Liza-Jane, have been tormented for a long time by problems which are easily overcome by the young, but cause massive complications for older citizens.The normally simple operation of climbing stairs is is a great task for Mrs Watson. Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy.

When the borders came down there was a great sense of freedom, he said.He painted a bleak picture for farmers and industry stating that the UK have half of the European flock of ewes and that there was ldquono other market for sheep farmers and that a no deal Brexit would see the industry ldquofall off a clf.Father Joe McVeigh told the meeting that he was ldquovery concerned about the potential impact that Brexit would have on people on the Border. He said he did not want to see a ldquo to the bad old days of checkpoints.Councillor Alex Baird, UUP, stated that he had voted remain in the referendum but said he found there was a ldquopolitical connotation to the Border Communities Against Brexit group and that as a unionist he felt that there had been a ldquoparty political element brought in to the discussion by the lobby group.Councillor Raymond Farrell commented that ldquohe was no fan of the EU and quoted Pope Francis in saying that ldquothe EU was in danger of losing direction. He asked Mr. Sheridan how sending poundm to Europe a week and getting just over poundm back was ldquogood economics.Mr. Sheridan replied by saying ldquowe could argue about figures all day but that it was ldquoa fact that Northern Ireland received pound. for every pound that went out.

Letter to the editorThe faculty are ‘Internationally Renowned Experts’ who are ‘experienced and active practitioners. Students for theology at Queen’s have a ‘ per cent overall satisfaction rate for their degree in the most recent National Student Survey results , ranked joint th in the UK.’ ‘The excellent standards of our education are recognised by employers who value the quality of our programmes and recognise the skills of our graduates.’Those aren’t actually my words, but the words of Queen’s University, promoting the BA Theology course taught by Union Theological College. To this day those words remain on their website, encouraging students to study at a high-class educational institute.QAA, the independent organisation which assess higher education in the UK, speaks in similarly glowing terms in its  review of the college, praising ‘The culture of supporting students and the meticulous care taken to foster personal growth and academic attainment’ as an area of good practice. They note the ‘very strong sense of community among staff and students, which enhances the students’ learning experience’ and highlight activities which ‘reflect a culture of student-centeredness and underpin the trust between students and staff, which enhances student engagement.’It is hard to understand how a college praised by independent assessors and promoted enthusiastically by Queen’s can suddenly be seen as unfit to teach. How can a college which helps students ‘develop breadth of vision and understanding of the place and role of Theology and Religion, in both the past and the present’ be unsuitable for ‘today’s post-conflict Northern Ireland’  Union seems to be getting blame for allegedly coming from a single denominational perspective. But a few years ago there were four colleges from a iety of backgrounds working with Queen’s. Now none are teaching undergraduate courses for Queen’s and some partner with universities in England where the likes of Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham all work with denominational colleges.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all. I would like to thank her for writing the book - especially with the personal things.The book is pound at www.jamessommerinrestaurant. co.uk  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But few expect it to be approved by a heavily ided Commons, and Tory MPs including Cabinet ministers appear to have begun to polarise between those who might support a no-deal Brexit and those who would actively battle against it.However, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, who supports the Best for Britain group backing a second referendum, insisted that MPs do have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit.She said: ldquoIs this really where the Brexiters have ended up  The merchants of lsquotake back controlrsquo have pivoted to lsquoyou canrsquot stop us from crashing the carrsquo.ldquoThis is a barking dog that will never bite. The reality is that Parliament can, and will, stop a no-deal Brexit. No politician worth their salt would allow such chaos and unnecessary harm.George Osborne warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to years in opposition for the Tories Earlier, Mr Osborne had launched a scathing attack on the Tories, warning that the party will not remain in power ldquounless it engages more with modern Britain and changes direction on Brexit.The politician-turned editor of the Evening Standard, who has been a vocal critic of Theresa May ndash who sacked him from the Cabinet in  ndash also attacked the Prime Ministerrsquos handling of negotiations.He accused her of following a ldquoBrexit means Brexit ideology because she backed Remain at the  referendum, ldquoalbeit sotto voce, and therefore ldquohad to prove her Brexit credentials.He told BBC Radio rsquos Today: ldquoThat was essentially a massive mistake by the Conservative administration, which it was punished for at the general election because the Conservative Party decided to embrace the Brexit result in such a way as to essentially dismiss the views of those who voted Remain, treat them as saboteurs or traitors, and run against urban Britain.Mr Osborne, who said he had warned then-PM David Cameron against holding the referendum in the first place, also attacked the ldquoreckless decision of hard Brexiteers to pursue a no-deal Brexit, saying: ldquoI donrsquot think the country voted to mobilise the Army, stockpile medicine, hoard food and go around the world buying every fridge available.ldquoThat is not what was offered and that is now what is happening..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: No-deal Brexit  udefault position uno alternative deal works, says Leadsom article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mexico has refused to do so.In recent days, though, Mr Trump tried to sht blame to Democrats for not acceding to his demand. He has given mixed messages on whether he would sign any bill into law.After the luncheon at the White House, Senator Lindsey Graham said, ldquoItrsquos clear to me he believes the additional funding is necessary.Senators approved a bipartisan deal earlier in the week to keep the government open into February and provide . billion dollarsfor border security projects, but not the wall.But as Mr Trump faced criticism from conservatives for ldquocaving on a campaign promise, he pushed to House to approve a package temporarily financing the government but also setting aside . billion dollars for the border wall.A test vote in the Senate on Friday showed that Republicans lacked the  votes needed to advance the House plan..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: US government unlikely to get fully back to business for days article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Parents in Moira, Maralin and other outlying areas would rightly be thinking whether a bus to Lurgan, then another bus to Portadown in the morning, then reverse the process in the afternoon - earlier starting and later finishing – would be conducive to their children’s well-being or learning.“The best way to meet their needs is that they remain on the Toberhewny site where teachers who know them, really know them, can offer them a first-class education.“Educators will tell you that transition at any age can bring regression for many children so why in Lurgan are we willing to let this happen “Previous Craigavon Senior High School principals often said it took at least a full term for pupils to settle down to learn. We are always teaching for readiness and when relationships are formed, the learning can begin.” They said staff at Lurgan Junior High School ‘would willingly embrace these young people and provide for them the best educational outcomes possible with a curriculum suited to their needs’.Their letter added: “The ideal solution would be for the pupils to remain on the Toberhewny site at a new - school, which would accommodate not only our - children but also those who would have gone on to Craigavon Senior High School .

Our pupils deserve to be treated equally.“Lurgan Junior High School is almost  years old so now is the time to be bullish and push for a modern, state of the art solution for all children in our catchment area.” In an appeal to parents they said: “Make every effort to attend the consultation meeting, Ask questions at the meeting, Speak up for your children – all are important whether Grammar or High School pupils.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
