Our Market Place containers are already widely recyclable, but we want to go a step further with the introduction of an incentive to encourage customers to switch to reusable containers.’Founder of the environmental charity, Hubbub, Trewin Restorick, (correct) said: ‘People are rightly concerned about the environmental impact of single-use packaging.‘It is massively encouraging to see M\u0026ampS become the first major retailer to offer customers a financial saving encouraging them to make an important change to their shopping habits. We hope customers will respond positively and other retailers will follow this lead.’Waitrose launched a trial in June at a store in Oxford that involved taking more than 200 products out of their packaging and selling them loose to people who use their own containers.         It\u0027s hoped the landmark move will encourage consumers to bring reusable plastic containers and cut out single-use packagingThe company is now extending the trial at this store beyond the original end date of August and is to roll-out elements of the initiative, which it calls Unpacked, to outlets in Cheltenham, Abingdon and Wallingford after an ‘overwhelmingly positive response’.All three shops will have a dedicated refillable zone, which will include dispensers for dried products, such a pasta, frozen ‘pick and mix’, coffee, wine and beer refills, as well as Ecover detergent and washing up liquid refillables. There will also be a wide range of loose fruit and veg.The breakthroughs provide evidence as to how people power and the Daily Mail’s more than 11 year campaign to highlight the dangers of plastic waste and pollution have helped trigger a dramatic cut in packaging across all the main supermarkets.Packaging manager at Waitrose, Karen Graley, (correct) said: ‘Like the Daily Mail’s campaign, we recognise that reducing plastics is a really important issue for the environment and for customers.’ Waitrose spokesman, Tor Harris, (correct) said: ‘The reaction to Waitrose Unpacked has been incredible with the invaluable feedback from thousands of customers giving us the confidence that they are prepared to change how they shop with us.‘We are keen to take the Unpacked concept forward and these additional tests will help us achieve this as well as understand its commercial viability. Through working with our customers and suppliers we will continue to learn and develop ideas which have the potential to be rolled out more widely.’ The campaigning group A Plastic Planet has been pushing supermarkets to do away with plastic packaging. Its co-founder, Sian Sutherland, said: ‘We are so encouraged to hear that Waitrose have had such a positive reaction from their customers on the ‘Unpacked’ trial. It is no longer acceptable to blame the public for plastic pollution.‘This is not a litter problem or a waste problem. It’s a manufacturing problem. Brands and retailers simply need to offer their customers a better choice, a new way of shopping that is guilt free. People buy what they are sold we need to be sold something different - it really is that simple. Businesses that do not step up to the challenge will be the next dinosaurs.’ Ocean plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK, Fiona Nicholls, said: ‘It’s great that Waitrose customers are embracing refillable containers to buy things like rice, coffee and detergent from dispensers, and that sales of these ‘unpacked’ product lines have overtaken their packaged equivalent.‘Other supermarkets now have no reason not to follow suit. We urge them to introduce dispensers for food and other products in their stores and ditch unnecessary plastic packaging without delay.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/14/5028F97F00000578-0-image-m-33_1536931549955.jpg","title":"Loch Lomond island oasis goes market 95 000","story":"Share this article Owners are expected to manage and conserve its special features, due to it being a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The island, about 364 metres long and 303 metres at its widest point, gets its name from the fact it is completely covered in ancient ivy draped trees including some Wych elms.

As he hits Edinburgh with sandwich boards, he explains why he’s never really happy with the resultsTwo light-box tables, like the ones a photographer would use to look at slides and negatives, are set in a corner of Alfredo Jaar’s airy studio in Manhattan. One is suspended from the ceiling, the other standing on the floor directly below it. Over the course of a minute, the suspended table is lowered to meet its twin. A thin black shadow is cast on to the studio’s walls at the moment of closure. As the table rises, the artist is brightly lit again, just as visitors will be when the piece, Lament of the Images, goes on show in Japan (Tate has an earlier version).There are no slides on the table, something that often confuses spectators, even those too young to have seen a slide. And that’s the point, says Jaar. The piece illuminates the onlookers in “a failed attempt to try and get people to see each other”, he says. Jaar is big on failure.For 30 years, the Chilean-born, New York-based artist has been confronting failure – our inability to see, our unwillingness to look, our struggle to communicate – fearlessly tackling some of the darkest horrors of our age, from the Rwanda genocide to the US’s “black site” detention centres and torture rooms. He’s never really happy with the results.“I’m an idealist and a utopian,” he says. “I want to change the world. And so in that sense, I fail all the time because I have failed to change it. I’ve failed to change the reality around me. Even though that was what I was trying to do.”At the Edinburgh art festival, Jaar is failing again. As part of the festival’s commissions programme, he is organising a public artwork that takes its title, I Can’t Go On, I’ll Go On, from the closing words of The Unnamable, a novel by another chronicler of failure, Samuel Beckett.Edinburgh’s Bridge of Sighs (appropriately enough) is home to a large neon sign quoting Beckett’s text, and his words will be spread through the streets of Edinburgh over the course of the festival by performers wearing sandwich boards: I Can’t Go On on their chests, I’ll Go On on their backs. It’s like the characters who used to walk around advertising The End Is Nigh. In this case it’s The End Is Nigh, But Perhaps Not Quite Yet.“It’s about our incapacity to change this reality, even though I keep going, I keep trying. Because this is the only thing I know,” Jaar says.A conversation with him will leave you with a reading list a mile long. He hoovers up the daily news, the only way he says he knows how to work, and salts his chat with quotations from favourite authors, films and magazine pieces. Today he recommends the bleak Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran (“It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late”), the poet Adrienne Rich and the films of Cuban director Tomás Gutiérrez Alea.Beckett’s words trigger a conversation about another favourite writer, Italian neo-Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who wrote about “the pessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will”. Gramsci was the source of another recent Jaar intervention, plastering Rome with posters of another of his quotes: “The old world is dying. The new world is slow to emerge. And in this chiaroscuro, monsters are born.”That chiaroscuro – dark as Caravaggio – is everywhere, Jaar warns. “We live in dark times.” Just look at the climate crisis, he says. “We face extinction. What does it say about us and about the world that the leader trying to change this reality is a little Swedish girl” – Greta Thunberg – “who is 16 years old?”All is not lost, however. “With my will, I have to be optimistic. If not, I would just kill myself,” he says, miming a gun to his head even as he beams another of his frequent, playful smiles. It’s obvious which has the upper hand in the battle between Jaar’s pessimistic intellect and his optimistic will.Born in Chile in 1956, Jaar grew up under the bloody rule of General Augusto Pinochet, the US and UK-backed dictator whose soldiers travelled the country murdering and torturing opponents in a “caravan of death”. Jaar escaped in 1982 after finishing a degree in architecture. The experience has informed his work ever since.“I know fascism when I see it,” Jaar says. When he escaped, “not even in my wildest dreams” did he expect to see the world facing what it is facing now. “We have fascism growing everywhere. In this country, in your country, in half of Europe, in Latin America.”Jaar has been tackling nationalism since at least 1987 when he erected a lightbulb-studded screen in Times Square, A Logo for America, reading: “This is not America.” It was saying the US was part of a continent, not the continent itself, at a time – then as now – of great conflict between the US and its neighbours. It was “a huge controversy. People were saying, ‘This is illegal, how could they let him do it?’” He has restaged the work several times since and its meaning has shifted as the politics have changed. Today, it seems to have been adopted as a comment on Trump, he says. “The semantics of what is America have changed completely and I accept that, gladly.”Today’s problems are different but seem just as dangerous. Thanks to the proliferation of social media and the rise of “fake news”, people are drowning in information and increasingly unable to disentangle truth from lies. “It’s insane,” Jaar says. “When the internet was created, we thought we had found this extraordinary tool that would change our lives. It was going to create the free flow of information, of ideas, with the rest of the world and so on. And now we have discovered the ugly end of these technologies.”He points to the way technology has been used to influence elections, both in the US and the UK, the constant distractions it creates, the undermining of truth. This, he believes, is where art has a role. Art can teach people to see, it can offer a way to get “back to the essential”.In a 2006 piece, The Sound of Silence, Jaar built a mini-theatre dedicated to one image, the Pulitzer-prize winning photographer Kevin Carter’s devastating picture of a starving Sudanese child crouched in a stony field and stalked by a vulture.The idea was to ask viewers to dedicate some time – eight minutes – to the picture and its story. A green light bids you to enter to watch a film that examines the history and politics of the image. Given the average time someone spends in front of a piece in a museum or gallery is 15 to 30 seconds, it’s a big ask, but it’s one Jaar believes is essential. “We see, but we don’t understand, because there is a lack of context. We have not created the models to resolve these problems.”Around the world, people are taught to read, “but who teaches us the influence that images, the media landscape, have? How it changes our vision of the world,” Jaar says. “I really believe that images are not innocent. Every image contains a conception of the world.” And too often those conceptions go unchallenged. The art world – not the art market, Jaar is keen to point out, which is fixated on money – is perhaps the only place where those conceptions are being challenged today, he believes. A place made up of millions of young people “who against the wishes of their families and the pressures of society have decided to become artists and are trying to make sense of the world”.He’s hopeful about the new generations now coming up, new artists, new thinkers, new leaders such as Thunberg. It’s one of the reasons he dedicates a third of his time to teaching. “I learn from them enormously,” he says. Perhaps someone who sees his Edinburgh piece this week will be inspired to make their own work. Perhaps they will offer us a new vision that can help us navigate the darkness. Intellectually, Jaar may be pessimistic about whether others can really succeed where he keeps “failing”. But his will is filled with optimism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d941004377786d607f439fd542378d4ae2bc9eb6/0_1482_2470_1481/master/2470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dfb6cc45dca6773fe1e804ffa3b466e","title":"philip pocock best photograph miriam berlin punk and her rat bestia","story":"‘The punks were sceptical of my presence. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think it was a sign of acceptance’I was in my mid-20s when Cornell Capa, director of the International Center of Photography in New York, recommended me for a job documenting life in the American sector of Berlin while the city was still ided. As a young photographer, I was so nervous. All of these senior German officials were swanning around my studio inspecting my work.I blurted out that I wasn’t American, that I was born in Canada, almost like a confession. I felt I had to tell them. They just looked at me quizzically, laughed and started speaking in German. I have no idea what they thought of me. But I got the job.In the west, I discovered a different side to the disorder. Every Saturday, punks would hang out, drink beer and blare music through their soundsystems. Cars would be set alight and bank windows smashed in. The cops would arrive, teargas them and send them running to find shelter in nearby bars, and the whole cycle would repeat. They were sceptical of me to begin with. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think that was a sign of acceptance.Getting to know them wasn’t easy, and it happened in the strangest of ways. I would carry a bunch of bananas to snack on while I wandered the streets. When I found the punks, I didn’t know what to say, so I offered them bananas. They just laughed at me. But they must have liked it, because they welcomed me into their crew.As I got to know them, I realised they fitted into the idea of the “wall sickness”, but they were the manic side of the depression that reigned in the east. There was something psychotic about punk at the time. These weren’t just weekend punks and “punk” wasn’t just a look – this was their life.The woman in this shot was called Miriam, and the rat on her shoulder is called Bestia. It was a week or so before Reagan was planning to visit, and there were windows smashed all over the city in protest. Despite the violence and the militancy, she was extremely gentle. She was big, much bigger than me, but she had a soft way of gesturing and moving.She invited me to her place, a nearby squat. We hung out, drank tea, took some shots and became friends. She introduced me to her rat, Bestia, who lived in her oven. Being a squat, it had no electricity, so it was perfectly safe. Bestia was almost like a  angel for Miriam, keeping her safe amid the anarchy. I think it was useful to keep guys off her back, too – nobody’s messing when you have a rat draped around your neck.People feel this image represents a moment in Berlin’s history, or the punk movement more broadly, but to me it’s a shot of someone I got to know, who welcomed me into a hard-to-reach scene. It was a doorway for me into other activist and protest scenes, and I remember the time fondly.People seem to think that punk has died, and maybe elements of the aesthetic have. But the spirit of punk was so much more than a look, and I think that lives on, albeit in different forms. I think we saw it in the Occupy movement, within elements of the Arab spring, and I think we are seeing it today in the UK with Extinction Rebellion.Training: Film and television production, New York University.Influences: Diane Arbus, Brassaï, the Capa brothers, Eikoh Hosoe, André Kertész, Dorothea Lange, Helen Levitt, Mary Ellen Mark, László Moholy-Nagy, Gordon Parks, Thomas Ruff, Aaron Siskind, Francesca Woodman.Low point: “A life-changing accident on a film set in 1979.”Top tip: “Draw with your eyes.

Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

Here’s how it wentLast week, as Paris faced down its hottest day since records began, the city authorities declared their readiness. Since the notorious heatwave of 2003 that killed thousands across France, the capital has put in place a heat strategy: cooling areas, a checking system for vulnerable people, shady parks kept open all night.Could these strategies actually work against a predicted record temperature of 42C (107.6F)? A study released this week shows that the world has never warmed faster than now. By 2050, the average temperature in the hottest month in Paris will rise by six degrees. This heatwave might be the new normal.Now that the heat has eased across Europe, it seems like time for some cool reflection on how effective the official advice actually was. Here’s what happened when I followed it.Temperature outside: 29CStrategy: shutter your house, spend three hours at low temperatureI wake in a sweat, having managed some fitful sleep with the help of a fan during one of the hottest nights in Paris history. Now it’s time to try to keep my tiny, 100-year-old house as cool as possible. Following the advice of the health department, I close all the shutters. Then I take my fluffy dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws. It’s pretty hot outside now, but nothing out of the ordinary: I’m mostly cranky and tired from the high temperatures overnight.Back home, the dog gets a big bowl of cold water, and I get ready for my day. According to the Paris heatwave plan, I have a plan to spend three hours at low temperatures to avoid adverse health consequences, and I’m prepared with other recommendations of the French health department: I’ve made a personal extreme-heat pack with a spray bottle to mist myself with water, a handheld thermometer and a large bottle of water. I’m ready.Temperature outside: 34CStrategy: spend time in air conditioningThe temperature outside my front door has improbably climbed by five degrees in the last hour alone. The city is already uncomfortable: the narrow pavements and heavy traffic make it feel even hotter than 34C. There’s nowhere to hide from the exhaust fumes and the already fierce sun.The official advice is to find air conditioning, so I walk to a nearby hotel. I’m already sweating when I arrive, but as soon as I step into reception my body temperature plunges uncomfortably. I’m also supposed to “eat in sufficient quantities”, which I’m interpreting to mean a buffet spread designed for hungry tourists and involving a lot of cheese. I look around at all the guests. They all passed a blissful night sleeping in 18C. They look refreshed, at ease, unflustered. One woman is wearing a scarf. I hate them.Temperature: 38CStrategy: use the Extrema app to seek out ‘cool islands’ avoid too much walkingIf 34C was uncomfortable, 38C is nasty. As the heat rises from the bitumen, I fire up the city’s dedicated heatwave app, Extrema, which identifies 922 “islands of cool”. The first place it recommends is a library: presumably air-conditioned, unfortunately closed. The next suggestion is a nearby church, the Église Saint-Germain-de-Charonne, which is deliciously cool – but a small mass is being held, and I feel like an intruder, so I pop out to the adjoining cemetery. Here, the heat radiates off the polished gravestones in waves: it’s worse than the street. I drink from a fountain, but the water comes out piping hot. I had heard there was a water mister nearby, so I set out to find it, but fail. Extrema confirms it was only installed for two days.Tramping around has driven my body temperature straight back up. The health department’s advice is to avoid physical exertion, such as walking long distances. I take the bus to a park.Temperature: 41CStrategy: use a heat map to find green spacesI’ve made a huge mistake. The bus is stifling, airless. My handheld thermometer has maxed out at 43C. I see pedestrians in the burning sunlight and I am jealous of them.Collapsing out at the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, I expect some relief, but temperatures outside have now officially broken the previous record, from 1947, of 40.4C. The Buttes-Chaumont is one of the city’s largest parks, with waterfalls, sloping lawns and shady grottoes. Since 2015, it has been open 24 hours a day in summer. Over half of it is covered with more than 100 enormous old trees, making it one of the coolest places in Paris, according to the heat map. But 41C is 41C. There’s an eerie hush as small family groups and the odd shirtless or bikini-clad inidual take refuge in the shade.Temperature: 42CStrategy: use town hall ‘refreshment rooms’ check in on loved onesAfter the 2003 heatwave, Paris set up the Chalex service, which allows vulnerable people to receive telephone check-ups during extreme heat. The worst sufferers can be brought to a refreshment room at their local town hall. In the 19th arrondissement, that’s an air-conditioned meeting room: it’s cool enough inside, but the portable air-conditioner is beginning to struggle against 42C.Emerging again into the blasting heat, I follow another of the health department’s rules: check in on your loved ones. In my case, that means texting my partner to ask how the dog is doing. The dog is lying in front of a fan, his fur gently ruffling. The dog is doing much better than me. I’m still radiating heat, primarily it seems from my face. But I’m also lucky that my loved ones are a young man and a resilient street dog. Elderly relatives, or people with reduced mobility who can’t necessarily make it to cooler spaces on their own, need human connection even more urgently in heat crises.Temperature: 42CAdvice: help the vulnerableIn any city, heatwaves are hardest for those who lack shelter. For the hottest part of the day, I join a walking group of city officials and volunteers seeking out women who are living on the streets. The group provides hygiene kits and offers to take the women to cooler spaces. Leading the charge is Dominique Versini, one of the city’s deputy mayors.Versini says the heatwave presents serious problems for all homeless people, but particularly women, who are “in twice as much danger”. Exposed to high levels of violence on the streets and often dealing with trauma, she says, many are afraid to access services such as refreshment rooms and public baths where they could cool off.The temperature hits its all-time maximum: 42.6C. The 18th is one of the densest parts of the city, and the photographer and I are struggling. My body is burning up, and now my anxiety is also rising sharply. I know this heatwave has almost certainly been caused by the human-created climate crisis. Greenhouse emissions are on track to reach a record high. I know I will live, best case, to see these problems get much worse. I feel a kind of existential dread. My muscles are starting to get sore.We duck into a supermarket and I end up caressing my face with a range of chilled goods. Orange juice is pretty good but a glass jar of foie gras works best.Temperature: 42.6CAdvice: swim in the canalOn a normal day, I harbour no desire to jump into the Bassin de la Villette. I have seen the bikes, shopping trolleys and electric scooters being fished out of there, coated in muck. There are rumours of a crocodile.But the outdoor pool alongside it, which is full of filtered canal water, has been in use since 2017 as part of a plan by the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to make public waterways such as the Seine swimmable in time for the 2024 Olympics. Anyway, at this stage I would happily leap into a Siberian toxic dump-lake if I thought it would cool me down.Unfortunately there’s a monstrous queue to get in, leaving would-be bathers baking along the pavement. Some have given up and are ing into the open canal. Everyone seems fine with this.I eventually make it to the pool, and lower myself with a sound I didn’t know I was capable of: something between a whimper of fear and a groan of satisfaction. The water is a toasty 25.5C, and oddly slimy, but swimming feels incredible. I’m smiling for the first time in more than 24 hours. I try to avoid thinking about how much canal water I’m ingesting, and that E coli scare from a couple of years ago.Temperature: 41CAdvice: douse yourself in cold waterThe effects of the pool wear off more or less as soon as I get out of the water and cross a bridge over the canal in full sun. On the other side, Paris Plage – a sandless beach along the banks of the canal and the Seine, set out with deckchairs, bars and summer games – is a muted affair, with most activities shut down because of the heat. A few people languidly dangle their feet in the water.But at the end of the canal, sweet relief. The city authorities have set up a temporary fountain that spouts water out of the top, not just from the taps below. I drench myself through. This is proper cold water, some of the first I’ve encountered today. It is extremely refreshing. I happily drip home on the metro.I am too traumatised to cook without air conditioning, so I head back to the same restaurant. The good news is that between breakfast, dinner and the refreshment room today, I have accumulated my required three hours at low temperatures. The bad news is the health department says I shouldn’t drink alcohol during a heatwave, and I could really use a beer.Rules are rules, so I stick with a carafe of water. It proves to be a bad choice: a beer would have at least been cold, while this tap water is somehow hotter than room temperature. I was starving but I can now only manage half of my meal, so I wander home to flop on the couch. It’s hot in my living room, but the shutters seem to have fended off the worst.Temperature: 33CAdvice: go to a 24-hour parkAt midnight, it still hasn’t cooled down enough to sleep. At a mere 33C outside I reckon it’s fine to walk the dog, so off we go towards the Square Sergent Aurélie Salel, one of 13 parks open all night in summer. We pass half an hour there, with a clutch of other overheated young Parisians who are smoking half-heartedly beneath a tree, before turning back home. Jammed between two fans, I grab what sleep I can, but I don’t fully relax until 11am the next day when a thunderstorm breaks the spell.I’m also acutely aware that I’m healthy and have some freedom and control over my movements. Many Parisians don’t: they have to move around the city according to their daily schedules, no matter the temperature. Some have no choice but to be outside all day during a heatwave. With its apps, cool spots and check-in services, the City of Paris is doing a lot to help them, but if my day taught me anything it’s that reality seems to be catching up with what research has long been telling us. The effects of rapid climate change are already here – and we are not ready.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f754b7aa2ec906846d30ddaccd43202b814768b7/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f5375041b9bc80d8b6961792b5b81b","title":"most people drink moderation what heavy drinkers can learn adrian chiles","story":"If you think no one sticks to the recommended maximum 14 units of alcohol a week, you’re kidding yourself, just like I once didThis time last year I was busy making a TV documentary about drinking.

Forced to defend her ideas and record as she attacked Biden’s, she showed the weakness of her policies, which are hard to distinguish from those of any of the other centrists in the race.Both candidates found themselves scrambling to stand their ground as the others sensed vulnerability and attacked. The only benefit of this particular match-up is that one middling politician might cancel out another, leaving the field open for a visionary.Joe Biden was anything but sleepy as he fended off relentless attacks over 2.5 hours Wednesday. Kamala Harris found fortune attacking him in the first debate, but she wilted when Tulsi Gabbard came up from behind and whittled her down over prosecuting poor people in California, and over inconsistencies in her healthcare plan. Cory Booker joined the assault on the former vice-president but was upbraided for his handling of the Newark police as mayor. Booker had a masterful close but otherwise barely distinguished himself.Front-runner Biden defended his record vigorously, bonded himself to President Obama on civil rights, and reminded viewers of his experience on the world stage. The real winner over two nights: universal healthcare, strongly endorsed by every candidate. It remains the top issue among primary voters. And nothing over two nights appeared to materially interrupt Elizabeth Warren’s steady momentum, while Harris did not have the best night.On Wednesday, Joe Biden came out swinging at Donald Trump and stayed on top after taking incoming fire throughout the night. Biden’s continued frontrunner status is assured until at least the next debate in September.Divisions displayed 24 hours earlier quickly resurfaced. Biden jabbed at Kamala Harris’s healthcare plan and attacked her proposal for its price tag and anticipated middle-class tax hikes. A former prosecutor and state attorney general, Harris was left uncharacteristically flummoxed.The next time the candidates clash, Biden will finally meet up with Elizabeth Warren in a clash of titans. Break out the popcorn.There were two big barriers to curbing catastrophic warming rightly called out on Tuesday night’s debate stage: the fossil fuel industry and Joe Biden.We still desperately need a climate debate. But the fact that CNN moderators asked Biden whether there would be a place for fossil fuels in his administration (his reply: “We’ll work it out!”) shows how effectively groups like the Sunrise Movement have pushed this crisis into the mainstream consciousness. “The time is up,” as Jay Inslee aptly put it. “Our house is on fire. We have to stop using coal in 10 years,” along with other fossil fuels.From a climate perspective, what’s worrying about Biden isn’t just his hodge-podge climate proposals and promise to return to an Obama-era status quo on decarbonization. It’s his consistently weak, fumbling performances that show how easy a target he’d be for Donald Trump to pick off in the general election. We should be grateful that other candidates went after Biden. Hopefully there’s more of that to come.On the second night of Democratic primary debates in Detroit, most of the moderators’ questions and candidates’ responses took aim at the reputations and policy proposals of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Why? These two candidates lead with white moderates and black voters – the backbone of a winning coalition for the eventual nominee. Cory Booker attacked Biden over his support for crime bills that had a disproportionate impact on communities of color. Tulsi Gabbard went after Kamala Harris’ prosecutorial record in California. Biden and Harris hit each other on nearly every issue up for debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aba399d73b705e2028028c5642990ef2f052dc7/0_129_2421_1452/master/2421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04079e8feb97764bc03945e0fa064f3e","title":"prince harry talking population royal family two children","story":"Oh Harry, it’s all a bit complicated isn’t it? From extracts released of a Vogue interview you have done with the great primatologist Jane Goodall, you imply that you plan to have just one more child because of your concerns about the environment.Well, compared with your parents and grandparents, that’s a good start. But the planet is not responding well to your jet-setting lifestyle, and two more little Sussexes adopting Dad and Mum’s ways won’t help.To make any difference to planet Earth, you and your family really must stop taking those private jets to Jamaica, the luxury safaris in Botswana, the weddings in Montego Bay, the impromptu winter getaways in Tromsø, the “babymoons” in Australia and New York, the downtime on Mediterranean islands and the quick flights to Fiji. Not to mention the ecological cost of living in all those grand houses and palaces or going on the royal tours.But you are right to link the fate of the planet with human population increase. It would be a dereliction of responsibility these days not to protect the planet, and many of the great conservationists, like Jane Goodall, David Attenborough and Chris Packham, recognise that the near tripling of human numbers in the past 70 years, along with the huge increase in the consumption of resources by the wealthy, have been responsible for the collapsing ecosystems, the climate crisis and pollution.So, of all the lifestyle choices you could make, having one less child is by far the best option. Research from Lund University in Sweden found that by choosing to have one less child, a parent would reduce their CO2 emissions by 58.6 tonnes a year during their lifetime over 25 times more than from any other action. Getting rid of the car, avoiding long-haul flights and going vegetarian are all well and good, but these actions, say the researchers, save very small amounts of CO2 in comparison with having one less child.And, Harry, you are no ordinary parent. In ecological terms you and your family are a herd of elephants trashing the forest. Over a lifetime, the average British-born babe will emit up to 150 times more CO2 than one born in Ethiopia. You are only 34, and you have probably already emitted more CO2 and other greenhouse gases than most of the 18 million people living in Malawi will do in their lifetimes.But it’s good that you spoke to Goodall, because very few people want to admit the inconvenient truth that population is a primary driver of global ecological crisis. Most political parties and environment groups are afraid to talk about it because it smacks of prejudice against countries with higher birth rates. How much easier to close the debate and blame all bioersity loss and climate change on the rich for their profligate lifestyles.Consumption matters, of course, but so do sheer numbers. World population, which currently stands at 7.5 billion, is increasing by 82 million people a year and looks likely to reach 11 billion within the lifetime of Prince Harry’s children. Sustaining another 3.5 billion people, or an extra India and China, will inevitably impact on climate, oceans and forests, and deplete natural resources. Many in areas of high growth want fewer children but cannot access contraception.However, population growth, resource consumption and environmental impact are closely linked, and there is little chance that the great extinction of species the world is seeing and the climate emergency can be turned round unless they are addressed together.As David Attenborough says: “It’s not just climate change it’s sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us. The natural world is doing it for us right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf416e20517608277de5d11568591a1a4d0aa4f/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=726c8010434fcb71919308e430e13533","title":"private higher education college goes into administration","story":"GSM London will stop teaching at end of September after failing to recruit and retain enough studentsOne of the biggest private providers of higher education in England has gone into administration, leaving students stranded on unfinished courses and looking for alternative places to study.GSM London, which offered undergraduate and postgraduate business courses at its campuses in Greenwich and Greenford, told its 3,500 students that all tuition, classes and exams would stop at the end of September.The for-profit college said it had been unable to recruit and retain sufficient student numbers to remain afloat in what it described as “highly challenging market conditions”.A GSM statement said: “Our students will be supported as far as possible while efforts are made to provide them with informed options for where they may be able to continue their studies beyond the end of the current teaching semester.“Discussions are already under way with other higher education providers to identify options, and information, advice and guidance will be provided to students as soon as the details have been finalised.”GSM’s demise will be seen as a blow to government attempts to open up the higher education sector to private providers as part of its marketisation of the higher education sector. It also reflects the growing financial pressures on universities.The University and College Union, which represents university and college workers, called on the government to look again at what it described as the “funding free-for-all” around private providers.“UCU has repeatedly highlighted concerns about the marketisation of education and the rapid increase in poorly regulated private providers,” said its acting general secretary, Paul Cottrell.“We hope that the government finally takes note and looks again at the funding a free-for-all among private providers who enjoy a competitive advantage in being under-regulated, but will always put profit before education.”GSM, which awarded degrees validated by the University of Plymouth, has claimed a longstanding commitment to widening access to, and participation in, higher education, offering a route to degree-level study for students from a wide range of non-traditional academic backgrounds.With insufficient numbers, however, it was forced to seek out additional funding, securing capital cash injections of £22m in the last three years. Efforts to find a new buyer earlier this year failed and administrators were appointed.A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said: “We are working closely with the provider and all relevant sector bodies to ensure the students affected are given the support and advice they need to continue their studies.Nearly one in four universities in England were in deficit last year. The number of universities in England with operating deficits in 2017-18 increased to 32, compared with 24 the year before and 10 in 2015-16. Across the UK, the number reporting deficits rose to 47, compared with 40 in 2016-17.Commenting on the collapse of GSM, the Office for Students said: “We understand that this news will be worrying for the students and staff at GSM. We understand that some students who are nearing the end of their studies will be able to stay at GSM but it is likely that most will need to transfer to another higher education provider.“We are, therefore, working with the DfE and partners across the higher education sector to ensure that students are supported and are able to make informed choices about the options that are available to them to transfer and continue their studies, or receive appropriate recognition for their academic achievements to date.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2eab46932a30cb8391b76c60dc040ae10e1052/0_157_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a6f7e10b602737f4434577915b235d7","title":"what should we do with radioactive nuclear waste","story":"The race is on to develop strategies for storing the most dangerous materials on EarthThere’s a small red hammer and sickle flag of the old Soviet Union on my dresser at home. I found it years ago on the floor of a primary school in Pripyat, the town built for workers at the doomed Chernobyl nuclear plant in what is now Ukraine.Perhaps it had been waved by a child at a state occasion, or had been left behind in the rush to evacuate Pripyat after the world’s worst nuclear disaster in April 1986.Less than two miles away, the stricken, crumbling Reactor 4 was one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Everything for miles around, from the mushrooms in the woods to the trucks left in the parking lots to the toys in the nursery and the hospital beds, was radioactive to some degree.Even though a dosimeter showed that after being washed down, the little flag was barely more radioactive than normal background levels found in nature, it should have been packaged up and landfilled as low-level nuclear waste.By contrast, Chernobyl’s Reactor 4 site will remain dangerous for tens of thousands of years. In July 2019, 33 years after the explosion, 200 metric tonnes of uranium, plutonium, liquid fuel and irradiated dust was finally encased below an enormous €1.5bn (£1.35bn) steel and concrete structure taller than the Statue of Liberty. The new sarcophagus will last about 100 years – after which it will deteriorate and future generations will have to decide how to dismantle and store it permanently.Skip forward to Cameron, Texas, on 16 January 2019. This was a nerve-racking day for Liz Muller, cofounder of California startup technology company Deep Isolation and her father, Richard Muller, professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and now chief technology officer at Deep Isolation.The father-daughter team had invited 40 nuclear scientists, US Department of Energy officials, oil and gas professionals, and environmentalists to witness the first attempt to test whether the latest oil-fracking technology could be used to permanently dispose of the most dangerous nuclear waste.At 11.30am, the crew of oil workers used a wire cable to lower an 80cm-long, 20cm-wide, 64kg canister — filled with steel rather than radioactive waste — down a previously drilled borehole. Then, using a tool called a “tractor” invented by the industry to reach horizontally into mile-deep oil reservoirs, they pushed it 120 metres farther away from the borehole through the rock.Five hours later, the crew used the tractor to relocate and collect the canister, attach it to the cable and pull it back to the surface – to the cheers of the workers. Until then, few people in the nuclear industry had believed this could be done.By avoiding the need to excavate large, expensive tunnels to store waste below ground, the Deep Isolation team believes it has found a solution to one of the world’s most intractable environmental problems – how to permanently dispose of and potentially retrieve the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste currently being stored at nuclear power plants and research and military stations around the world.“We showed it could be done,” Elizabeth Muller says. “Horizontal, directional drilling has come a long way recently. This is now an off-the-shelf technology. Using larger canisters, we think about 300 boreholes with tunnels up to two miles long would be able to take much of the US’s high-level nuclear waste. We think we can reduce by two-thirds the cost of permanent storage.”“We are using a technique that’s been made cheap over the last 20 years,” says Richard Muller, who has worked in the shale gas industry. “We realised we could put together the oil and nuclear technologies. One offered the solution to the other. These capsules can be lowered deep down, far deeper than anyone has proposed, and stored underneath a billion tonnes of rock so none of the radiation gets out.”The dilemma of how to manage nuclear waste – radioactive materials routinely produced in large quantities at every stage of nuclear power production, from uranium mining and enrichment to reactor operation and the reprocessing of spent fuel – has taxed the industry, academics and governments for decades.Along with accidents, it has been a major reason for continuing public opposition to the industry’s further expansion despite substantial interest in nuclear’s status as a low-carbon power source that can help mitigate climate change.In 80-odd years of nuclear power, in which more than 450 commercial reactors, many experimental stations and tens of thousands of nuclear warheads have been built, great stockpiles of different levels of waste have accumulated.The rest is made up of vast quantities of what is called low-level and very low-level waste. This comprises scrap metal, paper, plastics, building materials and everything else radioactive involved in the operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities.The consensus is that about 22,000 cubic metres of solid high-level waste has accumulated in temporary storage but not been disposed of (moved to permanent storage) in 14 western countries, along with unknown amounts in China, Russia and at military stations.A further 460,000 cubic metres of intermediate waste is being stored, and about 3.5m cubic metres of low-level waste. About 34,000 cubic metres of new high-level and intermediate waste is generated each year by operating civil reactors, says the WNA.The US, with 59 nuclear power plants comprising 97 working civil reactors, each generating at least several tonnes of high-level waste per year, has about 90,000 tonnes of high-level waste awaiting permanent disposal, according to the US Government Accountability Office.Although it is impossible to come up with a global total because of differences in how quantities are measured and reported, and with some inventories kept secret, other countries harbour significant amounts of waste as well.In the early days of nuclear power, waste of any sort was barely considered. British, American and Russian authorities, among others, dumped nuclear waste – including more than 150,000 tonnes of low-level waste – at sea or in rivers. Since then, billions have been spent trying to identify how best to reduce the amount produced and then store it for what may be eternity.Many ideas have been investigated, but most have been rejected as impractical, too expensive or ecologically unacceptable. They include: shooting it into space isolating it in synthetic rock burying it in ice sheets dumping it on the world’s most isolated islands and dropping it to the bottom of the world’s deepest oceanic trenches.Vertical boreholes up to 5,000 metres deep have also been proposed, and this option is said by some scientists to be promising. But there have been doubts, because it is likely to be nearly impossible to retrieve waste from vertical boreholes.Two scientific developments excite nuclear scientists. One is to build a new generation of advanced fast neutron reactors, which would use the high-level waste as fuel. This slowly emerging “Generation IV” nuclear power programme is billed by the industry as safer and more efficient. But even though such reactors can reduce the degree of hazard the waste poses, they do not solve the issue entirely.“These new reactors will still need a waste repository, likely as large as a repository for the waste produced by the current crop of conventional reactors,” says Allison MacFarlane, director of the Institute for International Science and Technical Policy at the George Washington University and chair of the US nuclear regulatory commission in 2012–14.The other technology that could reduce waste, known as transmutation, aims to reduce radiotoxicity by using lasers to change the composition of dangerous waste. It has been investigated for decades in the UK, US, Sweden and elsewhere but without great success.But the idea was boosted in December 2018 by French Nobel prize–winning physicist Gérard Mourou, who, in his acceptance lecture, said laser beams millions of times brighter than the surface of the sun in bursts that last a millionth of a billionth of a second had the potential to neutralise nuclear waste, reducing its half-life to a few years and its radioactivity to very little.“Nuclear energy may be the best candidate for the future, but we are still left with a lot of dangerous junk. The idea is to transmute this nuclear waste into new forms of atoms which don’t have the problem of radioactivity. What you have to do is to change the makeup of the nucleus,” he said in the lecture.But Mourou accepted that it might take decades before this “extreme light” solution could be deployed to destroy nuclear waste on an industrial scale.After decades of civil nuclear power and billions spent researching different geological sites and ways to best dispose of the waste, the problems are both technical and political, and the consensus of governments and industry is that deep burial is the best solution – at least for the moment.Yet, so far, no country has managed to build a deep repository for high-level waste.“Although almost every nuclear country has, in principle, plans for the eventual burial of the most radioactive waste, only a handful have made any progress and nowhere in the world is there operating an authorised site for the deep geological disposal of the highest level radioactive waste,” says Andrew Blowers, author of The Legacy of Nuclear Power and a former member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, set up to advise the British government on how and where to store nuclear waste.“Currently no options have been able to demonstrate that waste will remain isolated from the environment over the tens to hundreds of thousands of years. There is no reliable method to warn future generations about the existence of nuclear waste dumps,” he says.“The nuclear legacy stretches into the far future it poses a risk to environments and human health for periods which extend well beyond our comprehension. Radioactive waste is the achilles heel of the industry,” says Blowers.The US has come closest with a single deep repository. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is a 655-metre deep complex for the disposal of “transuranic” waste, or long-lived intermediate level waste, mostly deriving from military bomb-making.By law, however, all high-level US nuclear waste must go to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which since 1987 has been the designated deep geological repository about 90 miles north-west of Las Vegas.But the site has been met with continued legal, regulatory and constitutional challenges, becoming a political yo-yo since it was identified as a potentially suitable repository. It is fiercely opposed by the Western Shoshone peoples, Nevada state and others.A massive tunnel was excavated in Yucca Mountain but was never licensed and the site is now largely abandoned – to the frustration of the federal government and the nuclear industry, which has raised more than $41bn (£34bn) from a levy on consumer bills to pay for the repository and which must pay for heavy security at their temporary nuclear waste storage sites.“We need a high-level repository. We are holding waste now at about 121 sites across the US,” says Baker Elmore, director of federal programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute.He is supported by the US energy secretary, Rick Perry. “We have a moral and national security obligation to come up with a long-term solution, finding the safest repositories available … we can no longer kick the can down the road,” he said at a Senate hearing in June 2017.Political and community opposition to plans has made progress painfully slow in most countries. In the UK, the government has offered communities money, but has been unable to persuade any local authority to host a permanent deep repository. Massive protests in France and Germany helped fuel the political rise of the Green party and have indefinitely delayed or stopped work on proposed repositories.Only Finland is close to completing a deep repository for high-level waste. In May, work started on an “encapsulation” plant where waste will be packed inside copper canisters that will be transferred into 400- to 450-metre deep underground tunnels. But doubt has been cast on the long-term safety of the canisters.“The problem is intractable,” says Paul Dorfman, founder of the Nuclear Consulting Group, made up of about 120 international academics and independent experts in the fields of radiation waste, nuclear policy and environmental risk.“The bitter reality is that there is no scientifically proven way of disposing of the existential problem of high- and intermediate-level waste. Some countries have built repositories, some plan them.“But given the huge technical uncertainties, if disposal does go ahead and anything goes wrong underground in the next millennia, then future generations risk profound widespread pollution.”Many people now doubt that a satisfactory final repository will ever be found.“Managing the nuclear legacy is not just a technical issue but a social one,” says Blowers.“Given the timescales involved, there is no need to hurry. Society can and should take its time dealing with its nuclear legacy.”• This article originally appeared on Ensia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cfdddfc69bb014d577004a0d51caa0870df6275/182_225_3825_2291/master/3825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e3f1d7ce3ca61556b7b22d37bc8024b","title":"blackrock lost 90bn investing in fossil fuel companies report finds","story":"World’s biggest fund urged to invest in clean energy for good of the climate and its investorsBlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has lost an estimated $90bn over the last decade by ignoring the serious financial risk of investing in fossil fuel companies, according to economists.A report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that BlackRock has eroded the value of the $6.5tn fund by betting on oil companies that were falling in value and by missing out on growth in clean energy investments.The report found that BlackRock’s multi-billion dollar investments in the world’s largest oil companies – including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP – were responsible for the bulk of its losses.The fund was also stung by the collapse of big US fossil fuel companies, including General Electric, and the coal mining company Peabody. BlackRock faces growing pressure to est from fossil fuels by investors and environmental groups, which have accused the asset manager of dragging its feet on the climate crisis.Tim Buckley, a director at IEEFA and co-author of the report, said BlackRock’s enormous financial heft meant it should take responsibility for leading on the climate emergency.The mega-fund is larger than the economy of Japan, the third largest economy in the world, making it the single largest investor in the global coal industry and one of the top three investors in most big oil companies.“BlackRock wields an enormous amount of influence and shoulders a huge responsibility to the wider community. It has the power to lead globally to address climate risk, yet, to date, it remains a laggard,” Buckley said.The report follows a stark warning from the Bank of England over the “significant risks to the economy and to the financial system” posed by fossil fuel investments.The Bank has estimated that investments worth $20tn could be left “stranded” as governments set more ambitious climate targets.BlackRock has denied responsibility for its fossil fuel investments because the majority of its funds track investment indices which are controlled by third parties, meaning it does not choose inidual companies to back.The IEEFA has used the report to call on BlackRock to propose its own low emissions index benchmark for the passive funds to avoid risking its clients’ investments.It has also called on the fund to appoint a new independent chairman and refresh its 18-strong board, where six members are former executives from companies with close ties to the fossil fuel industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011cdcafce21a4bba2c459b6e1d1ddf0d6f82dc0/76_377_2429_1458/master/2429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=096575d9450184573841377937d12f23","title":"slow fashion how to keep your favourite clothes for ever from laundering to moth proofing","story":"Extending the life of your wardrobe is good for the planet and your finances. Experts give their tips on how to make your outfits last as long as possibleUnless you plan to wear a suit of armour for the rest of your life, there is no way to make your clothes last for ever. You can get close to for ever – if you are prepared to darn. As a society, though, we have become less inclined to make do and mend because the advent of fast fashion has made clothes so affordable that there is no incentive to repair them. In addition, the acceleration of trends – where once there were just two seasons, autumnwinter and springsummer, now there are also resort, cruise and pre-fall collections – means consumers are continually enticed to buy new things. It is estimated that, in the UK, the average lifetime for an item of clothing is 2.2 years.Extending the life of our clothes isn’t just good for our finances, but also benefits the environment: the fashion industry is a major global polluter and human rights abuses are rife in the garment industries of developing nations.Not so long ago, people learned basic sewing skills. The chances are that, if you ask an older friend or relative, they will be able to show you how to patch things. And there is no doubt that, if you want your clothes to last as long as possible, looking after them is the best place to start. But how do you make your clothes last for ever? We asked some experts.It sounds obvious, but if you want your clothes to last, you need to invest in well-made garments in good-quality fabric. Don’t assume that expensive items are best – check for yourself.“The first thing to do when you’re looking at a piece of clothing is turn it inside out and pull at every piece of string you find,” says Orsola de Castro of Fashion Revolution. “When clothes are cheaply made, the seams are often shabby. If it starts to unravel – don’t buy it.”She suggests making sure the seam allowance on a pair of trousers or a skirt is enough to allow you to let them out and the hem is such that you could make the garment longer if you need to. She also advises checking that shirts have a spare button sewn in so if one falls off, you have a replacement.Vintage clothing expert Amy Winston-Hart of Amy’s Vintage says you should hold garments up to the light: “If you can see light coming through the fabric, it’s going to go quickly.”Every garment will eventually wear out after repeated wearing and washing, but the jury is out on which fabrics are the most durable. Some experts prefer the longevity of synthetic fibres such as polyester, while others favour natural fibres such as cotton.Charles Ross, sustainability expert and lecturer at the Royal College of Art says: “I prefer wearing synthetics because I believe they are more durable fibres. If you have two identical T-shirts in cotton or polyester, the cotton will wear out quicker.” The more you wash clothes, the quicker they wear out. De Castro echoes Stella McCartney’s recent advice that we should refrain from over-cleaning clothes. “If something is made from good-quality wool, such as a man’s suit, it’s designed to be brushed clean and not washed,” she says. If you must wash things in a machine, use a low heat, and put delicate fabrics in a laundry bag to reduce tearing.There are plenty of ways to refresh clothes without bunging them in the machine: De Castro suggests spot-cleaning tricky stains, or taking whiffy garments into the bathroom while you shower, to steam them. This will not only help to make your clothes last longer, but is also more environmentally friendly. The average washing machine uses 13,500 gallons of water a year, as much as you drink in your lifetime.Winston-Hart has some nifty tricks for cleaning items without putting them in the machine. “A mixture of lukewarm water and vodka will get rid of smells,” she says. Use three parts vodka and two parts water if something is very stinky, or three parts water and two parts vodka if it only has a light musk. “Stick the mixture in a spray bottle and mist it over. If your clothing still smells bad the next day, give it another spray.” She is also a fan of popping clothes in the freezer, for an overnight refresh. If things are still pongy, hang them out on the line on a breezy day – you will be surprised by how much it can help.None of the experts I speak to are fans of dry cleaning, although they accept it is sometimes necessary. “Dry cleaning doesn’t always clean stuff that well,” says Winston-Hart. “Sometimes it comes back smelling worse – that chemical smell.” By looking after your clothes as much as possible, you can cut back on dry cleaning.An important caveat: items worn close to your skin, particularly underwear and socks, should be washed at an adequate heat. Don’t fling pants in with your dish towels on a 30C wash. “You really don’t want to put bedding, tea towels, gym kit, underwear and socks in at a low temperature,” says environmental health practitioner Dr Lisa Ackerley. All need to be washed at a minimum of 60C.If you are worried about ruining your underwear, wash it at a lower temperature, but add an antibacterial cleanser to the wash.Katrina Hassan, a professional organiser, recommends periodically decluttering your wardrobe. “Get all your clothing in one space – I call it the power of the pile. A lot of people aren’t aware of all the things they own, until they see it.”Decide which items to keep, and check them over for damage. Store things properly – Hassan teaches clients how to fold clothes, then stack them in an upright position, so you can see everything you own at once. “When you store things vertically, you’re less tempted to buy things, and more conscious with your consumerism … you know exactly what you own, and where it’s stored.”Store expensive items in cotton suit bags to prevent moth damage. (If you are on a budget, Winston-Hart suggests using an old single bedsheet, cutting a hole in it for a coathanger to poke through, then sewing up the sides for a DIY suit bag.)To get the most out of your footwear, ensure you look after the leather. “I tend to wear Timberland boots,” Ross tells me, “and every six weeks I wash off the dirt and put on a leather conditioner to keep them going for longer.” (He favours a brand called Nikwax.)It is not just footwear that you can treat to make it last longer: brands such as Polygiene use silver chloride technology, which is antimicrobial, to put a finish on fabrics. “If you have the finish on a polyester T-shirt, you can wear it for five years before it starts smelling,” claims Ross.“I have a deep relationship with my local tailor,” says De Castro. Once a year, she sorts through all her items, and then takes them in for repairs. “They’ll fix niggly things such as dropped hems, change the zips on evening gowns, or let things in and take them out.” When a pair of shoes starts to wear out, consider whether they can be resoled. Ross has worn the same pair of outdoor boots since 1985: the soles have been replaced six times.It is easy to do basic repairs yourself. “If you want to start repairing things and you’re not sure how to go about it, try out on some scrap fabric first,” says repairs expect Tom van Deijnen of the Visible Mending Programme. He recommends watching YouTube videos to learn basic skills, and asking family and friends for help. “In my experience, mothers and grandmothers always come up trumps,” he says.With worn-out jeans, Van Deijnen recommends sewing on patches. “Use a similar colour fabric, in the same weight as the original material – if it’s a woven fabric, patch it with a woven fabric, and if it’s a jersey fabric, use a jersey patch.”A common mistake people make when darning knitwear is to do it too tightly. “It doesn’t leave room for shrinking – sometimes threads can shrink when they are new. And if you pull the hole too tight, it can also cause a pucker, which creates tension in the fabric, meaning it will rip again.”Van Deijnen explains the best way to sew on a button. “Thread the needle, make some stitches in the fabric, then attach the button and sew it on. Do it a good few times. When you’ve finished, tug on the thread. If it comes loose, you didn’t do a good job.”Not every item can be repaired. “I’m quite adventurous and I’ll always give things ago, but sometimes things can be completely beyond repair,” says Van Deijnen. He recently had to bin a knitted tie that was riddled with moth eggs. The fabric disintegrated in his hands when he touched it, so he had no choice.When something can’t be fixed, think of alternate uses for it. “Everything can have another function at the end of its life,” says De Castro. She cuts up old swimsuits to use as hair ties (old tights are also good for this). And old T-shirts make the best cleaning rags.Donate intelligently. “Charity shops are brimming with our clothes,” says De Castro, “so you should only donate to charity what you think will sell. Otherwise, you’re dumping your problem on another organisation.” If you know it won’t sell – perhaps because it is old gym kit – take it to a textile-recycling bank where it can be turned into a new item. (Trainers can be recycled at branches of Runners Need.) The Love Your Clothes campaign has a textile bank locator, along with other resources, on its website.If you want your clothes to last, it can make sense to buy vintage: things made before 1980 tend to be made to a higher standard than modern items. “Even cheaply made 1970s trousers, if you turn them inside out, will resemble couture now,” says De Castro. But there is also a lot of factory-made fake vintage out there. How to tell? Look at details such as zips – is there a hook and eye to keep the zip in place? If not, it may be a fake. Other signs include 40s-style dresses with elasticated fabric – stretchy material wasn’t around then.Look after your vintage. “Armpit shields are really good,” says Winston-Hart. “They’re just cotton half-moons you attach with safety pins to your clothing under the armpits. You remove the pins and wash the pads themselves – which saves you having to wash the garment all the time.”Wearing a slip under a skirt means you don’t have to clean the skirt as often, as it is not touching your skin, cutting down on dry cleaning costs and reducing wear. If the slip is made out of silk, it will also help to regulate your body temperature. There are so many places to find secondhand treasures, whether it is a clothes swap with friends, charity shops or car boot sales. If you are a vintage aficionado, Winston-Hart recommends her favourite stores: Apple Tree Vintage, 1940s Style For You, Scarlet Rage Vintage, Blackout Vintage Fashion and Hunky Dory Vintage. (Many have online stores.) If vintage isn’t your thing, find more contemporary secondhand pieces on eBay or Depop. Sometimes, buying new clothes can be a sustainable choice – Hiut Denim will do free repairs on your jeans for life.It is not just about buying vintage or secondhand clothes. Ross talks about “emotional durability,” or the attachment to our most beloved clothes, because the most sustainable item in your wardrobe isn’t always the one that is ethically produced from non-polluting fabrics. It is the one you love, and will wear your whole life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16b4fff3a67db340c5f6b150da1b03e4d82c04a/0_718_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d0ebfab1302af935c93079f153dad47","title":"samantha morton no regrets at working with woody allen","story":"The actor, who survived sexual abuse as a child, says director was ‘wonderful to work with’Samantha Morton has said she has “no regrets” working with Woody Allen and that she remains “forever grateful” for the experience.In an interview with Vanity Fair, Morton, who worked on Allen’s 1999 picture Sweet and Lowdown, said: “I was working for a director who was kind, funny, and wonderful to work with. It changed my life. And I’m forever grateful for that.” In Sweet and Lowdown Morton played a mute laundry woman who falls for jazz guitarist Emmett Ray (played by Sean Penn) she was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar.Morton said she didn’t have any regrets despite Allen facing accusations of abuse by his daughter Dylan Farrow that first emerged in 1992, and which the director denies. Morton spoke to the  in 2014 about her experience of being abused a number of times while in residential care.“I’m terribly sorry for the situation that is publicly known. It’s heartbreaking,” said Morton. “I was sexually abused. Some of the people that hurt me can’t be brought to justice for complications of time. I have full sympathy for anybody who says that happens to them, and it needs to be taken incredibly seriously.”In the wake of Farrow’s allegations against Allen, a number of the director’s former collaborators – including Timothée Chalamet, Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Rebecca Hall – have publicly stated they would not work with him again. Allen launched legal action against Amazon after they shelved A Rainy Day in New York, a film he shot for the studio in 2017, and they cancelled their contract with him, citing Farrow’s allegations and Allen’s response to the #MeToo campaign.However, a number of other actors, including Jude Law, Javier Bardem and Anjelica Huston, have defended their work with Allen and in Bardem and Huston’s case that they would be happy to work with him again.Allen is currently shooting a film in Spain, provisionally entitled Rifkin’s Festival, starring Christolph Waltz, Gina Gershon and Elena Anaya, saying: “I never think of retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad6055c513860aa5df6fe74f2e56b041dacfde4/835_2967_3287_1971/master/3287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ae87cd968c81f6025f3e9d8a9f60f6","title":"how to make strawberry shortcakes recipe","story":"As summery a dessert as they come, for lovers of strawberries and cream or sconesThough they have their origins in Britain, strawberry shortcakes feel to me like an American summer classic, redolent of long afternoons on the porch with a pitcher of iced tea. Which is not to say they’re not worth repatriating – short of serving up a big bowl of strawberries and cream, these fluffy, buttery little scones are the quickest way to go from fruit to feast.400g strawberries, hulled and washed 30g caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp extra2 stems mint, leaves finely chopped85g cold butter, plus 3 tbsp extra300g flour¼ tsp fine salt2½ tsp baking powder300ml whipping cream1 egg yolk, beaten with a little milk1 tsp demerara sugar, to sprinkleSeeds of 1 vanilla podCut the larger strawberries into quarters and smaller ones in half. Put about a third of them in a bowl (choose any that are slightly mushy, or indeed underripe, if there are any) and crush with a fork into a rough puree. Mix these back into the remaining cut fruit, along with the caster sugar and the chopped mint, and set aside while you make the shortcakes.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7 and melt the extra three tablespoons of butter in a saucepan. Use some of this to lightly grease a large baking sheet, and set the rest aside in a warm place for later, stirring it occasionally if it threatens to solidify.Sift the flour into a large bowl, then whisk in the remaining tablespoon of caster sugar, the salt and the baking powder. Grate or cut in the cold butter, then rub this into the dry ingredients with your fingertips, until it looks like coarse breadcrumbs. Stir in 160ml of the cream, to make a soft dough, adding more cream if need be.Knead briefly, just until smooth (overworking the dough will make the cakes tough, so try to handle it as little as possible), then tip on to a lightly floured surface and roll or pat out until it’s about 5mm thick. Use a 6cm cutter to cut out eight rounds, twisting it as you push it down into the dough for a better rise.Put half the rounds on the greased baking sheet, brush the tops with melted butter, then put the other halves on top of them. Brush the tops of these with the beaten egg, sprinkle with the demerara sugar, then bake for about 20 minutes, until well risen and golden on top.Once the shortcakes are out of the oven, pull them apart as soon as they are cool enough to handle, and brush the middles with any remaining melted butter. Set aside on a rack to cool while you prepare the cream.Pour the cream into a large clean bowl and whip until it just starts to thicken. Use a sharp knife to scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod into the cream, and carry on whisking until you have soft, billowing peaks. Divide the bottoms of the shortcakes (the ones without the egg wash and demerara sugar topping) between four plates and put a blob of whipped cream on each.Put a generous spoonful of the strawberry compote on top of the cream, then finish by putting the tops on each shortcake. Do this gently and at an angle, so the filling is still visible (if you try to sandwich them on top, you’ll spoil the effect). Serve immediately, preferably while the shortcakes are still slightly warm.This recipe works with most summer fruit – raspberries, ripe peaches, plums or apricots, or lightly stewed gooseberries or currants – but you’ll need to adjust the sugar content depending on the fruit. In the case of stone fruits, you may wish to add a squeeze of lemon juice, too. If you use cooked fruit, give it time to cool, or it will melt the cream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddce67f7984ea3c223851eeced333cbcda3651db/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d262f3b6a1ced38e2d55bcfb1db3d745","title":"if its monday it must be moussaka how meal planning can save you stress and money","story":"Tired of scrabbling around for last-minute dinner ideas and throwing away unused perishables? These 10 tips will get you properly organisedKate Turner is aware that the chalkboard meal-planner in her Sussex kitchen can bewilder visitors. “Friends come round and go: ‘Wow, my God!’,” says the author of My Zero-Waste Kitchen. That breakfast, lunch and dinner wallchart (Wednesday: porridge Dad’s salad pilaf Thursday: cereal, tuna sandwiches spinach pie) may look overwhelming, but Turner insists: “It’s not scary. Not having to think about what you’re cooking is liberating. It saves money, time and stress.”Meal-planning has a way to go before it becomes mainstream, but it has long been a hit with weight-loss experts and wellness gurus, and the growing desire to cut food waste has led to a new wave of interest.True, using every scrap of your shopping across purposefully planned meals is a habit you have to develop. But whether you cook complex dishes from scratch every night or are more of a pasta-and-sauce person, to Turner, planning makes unbeatable ecological and financial sense. “If you’re wasting food, you’re wasting money,” she says. “I’m really keen this isn’t seen as a middle-class hobby. It’s a money-saver for anybody.”But where do you start? Here are 10 tips from experts.Whether you use a Google doc, a spreadsheet, a magnetic fridge whiteboard or a simple notepad, you first need to setup a seven-day planner that you can easily edit – one week being a reasonable timeframe in which to use fresh ingredients before they spoil. If you prefer, there are apps (Yummly, SideChef, Smart Recipes) that can help you pick meals and recipes and generate shopping lists.Make it enjoyable, urges the chef Miguel Barclay, the author of One Pound Meals: “You don’t have to start on Monday. Start on Friday night’s curry if that’s the meal you look forward to most, or Sunday roast if that’s non-negotiable. If cooking’s not exciting, in six months you’ll be back on takeaways.”A meal plan should not dictate your life. As you plan, jot down what you are doing each day (meeting mates for a drink after work, picking the kids up late from football) and think about what time you have to cook, if at all. Working across seven days gives you flexibility. You can stay late in the pub or order a takeaway on a whim without creating disastrous waste. “I can’t be rigid about it,” says Turner. “Work and family life don’t allow for that. If meals get shunted around the week, that’s fine.”Food offers infinite possibilities. To write a quick meal plan, you need to narrow them down, establishing a framework that works for you. You might start by choosing three meats a week, from a whole chicken to a pack of bacon, then select recipes that use those meats across two or three different meals. Or you might be led by leftovers: select three main meals you love, then choose recipes for the other days that use up any raw or cooked remants. Cooking dinner plus an extra portion for tomorrow’s lunch is a third way to minimise cost and waste.In choosing meats, think about leftovers. You can use cold roast beef as pie filling or in a sandwich but, arguably, it’s less user-friendly than leftover roast chicken, which can be used shredded in stir-fries, or in soups and salads.Another useful discipline is to stick to one type of cuisine each week (Indian, Italian, Chinese), so you don’t end up having to use leftover pak choi in a lasagne. “If you do Thai on Tuesday and pizza on Wednesday, you’ll have waste,” says Rachel Beckwith, the family editor at BBC Good Food magazine.“Whatever I’ve got left over from my last dish, I use as the first piece of the jigsaw for my next recipe,” says Barclay, a pro chef with a vast mental Rolodex of ideas to draw on. But where should the rest of us look for inspiration? “Type ‘leftover chicken recipes’ into Google,” he suggests. “There’s the 10 best leftover chicken recipes, pictures, everything. There is no secret to finding recipes: just type it into Google, pick one, move on. Google are trying to make driverless cars. Do you not think they moved on to that after they sorted out the leftover-chicken recipes?”It needn’t be huge, but put together a store cupboard of basic carbs (dried pasta, lentils, rice) flavourings (soy sauce, stock cubes, dry herbs, spices) tins (pulses, tomatoes, tuna) and frozen veg, such as peas. You will be ready to tackle most planned meals.Browsing online can be helpful by showing you pack sizes as you write your meal plan, but deliveries can often include short-dated products or already ripe fruit that you need to speed-eat, disrupting that plan. Instead, shop in person, ideally somewhere you can weigh out the ingredients you need. Write your shopping list in a rough date order as a reminder to buy items with a longer sell-by date that you plan to use later in the week.Choose any deals wisely, warns Beckwith. “It’s a false economy if you buy something two-for-one and it goes bad in the fridge. Supermarkets want you to pay for that wastage.”“Chorizo and bacon are perfect examples,” says Barclay. “A little goes a long way, whereas something like steak is very poor value.”Use prime ingredients with a short shelf-life early, as through the week you will accumulate leftovers that require retooling – into a sausage, tomato and cabbage chilli pasta, say, or a one-pot stew. “I use more curries and bolognese-type recipes at the end of the week, where it doesn’t show if a courgette’s gone past its best. It’s more forgiving, especially things with spices,” says Beckwith.A well-organised freezer is the bedrock of minimal-waste meal planning. It allows you to save most leftovers or tired, withering items (bananas, pureed fruits, chopped onions and garlic, herbs blitzed into a pesto etc), and maintain a stash of meals to fall back on when you are too busy or cannot be mithered cooking.How you store things is a matter of taste and budget (reusable zip-lock bags, Tupperware, recycled plastic takeaway containers), but clearly label everything, including the date frozen and ideal use-by date, which will usually be within three months.“An hour or two of prep each weekend (making meals for the freezer or, perhaps cooking mince that you can turn into a shepherd’s pie) will make it far more likely that you stick to your meal plan during the week.A warning: test any recipes before you XXL them. Making a huge vat of revolting veggie chilli for the freezer that you reluctantly trudge through over several weeks will definitely erode your enthusiasm for this whole meal-planning malarkey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f553c39901a8c3bcc99f1206ef24bdef3943f83/0_111_5656_3394/master/5656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40990f80697a414bc1fa0a910127dc8d","title":"were not afraid to lead myanmar displaced find a new voice","story":"Fearful for their safety, many of the 241,000 people forced from their homes by conflict in Myanmar are reluctant to go back. Now campaigners are mobilising to resist organised returnsBawk Nu Awng hasn’t been home since 2011. All three of the villages where she spent her childhood have been destroyed.“War hit wherever my family lived,” she said. “I feel like it is my responsibility to engage in all matters related to peace.”Now aged 21, Bawk Nu Awng, from Kachin in Myanmar, has emerged as a spokesperson among youth displaced by conflict.When Aung San Suu Kyi took power in 2016, her party, the National League for Democracy, pledged to prioritise ending conflict in Myanmar. Yet the country’s various ethnic groups continue to fight for increased federal autonomy.In Rakhine state, conflict is escalating between Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, and the rebel Arakan Army. Nationwide, an estimated 241,000 people like Bawk Nu Awng remain in camps, including more than 97,000 in Kachin state.Camps for internally displaced people are the most visible evidence of Myanmar’s ongoing strife. With elections coming up next year, political momentum to send displaced people home has accelerated.Kachin, which shares a border with China’s Yunnan province, is a strategic area for China’s belt and road initiative, a global development strategy that includes a multi-billion pound China-Myanmar economic corridor. In March, Yunnan officials met with the influential Kachin Baptist Convention support for returns and a peace agreement was encouraged, with the Chinese contingent suggesting stability could bring investment and development.In December, the Tatmadaw offered a short unilateral ceasefire, since extended to 31 August, to three ethnic armies in northern Myanmar including the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).Shortly after the announcement, the first organised returns occurred, the Tatmadaw accompanying a group of displaced people back to the village of Nam San Yang, despite having deactivated land mines only weeks before. Talks have since been held between the government and the Kachin Humanitarian Concern Committee, a group headed by church leaders that mediates on returns. No displaced people have been included in the meetings.In early June, longtime activist Lum Zawng, 30, brought together 43 young displaced people in the state capital, Myitkyina, to discuss their perspective on returns. Nawng Lat, 31, who was at that meeting alongside Bawk Nu Awng, said: “We urgently had to form a group to think deeply about our returns and raise our voice.”The group developed a statement, published on Facebook, stating that returns should only happen when safety and dignity could be assured, and when people have been consulted and are free to decide when to return without pressure or force being applied. It also stated that displaced people should not be used for political, economic or social advantage.Nawng Lat, who is from Nam San Yang village, was not part of the group that returned. He is eager to go home, but only when conditions are right. When fighting resumed eight years ago, he never imagined living in a camp for so long. “My first thought was that the war would last a few months,” he says. “After about three years, everything became unsure. I wondered why it was happening, why we couldn’t go back.”Now he is among more than 38,000 displaced people living in areas outside the government’s jurisdiction. With limited access to higher education and jobs, many young people leave for China in search of livelihoods, where they are vulnerable to trafficking and abuse.“The longer we stay in IDP camps, the more problems we face,” he says. “I don’t want returns to happen under pressure. I’m not saying we don’t want to go back actually, we are eager to back as soon as possible. It’s been eight years since we have been displaced and we have lost so many things related to our education and development. We will only return after we have a security guarantee.”Bawk Nu Awng wants a guarantee that landmines have been cleared: “Currently, it is like they want us to stay in a house that is not fully built. When it rains, it will leak. Only after they have fully built the house should we stay in it. There needs to be trust. In June, the activists staged a public drama performance to commemorate the war’s eighth anniversary. Pau Lu and fellow organiser Seng Nu Pan informed the authorities yet, moments before the performance, police turned up claiming that extra permissions were required. The event was moved and went ahead, but Pau Lu and Seng Nu Pan were charged with holding an unauthorised protest. They now face a maximum three-month prison sentence in the ongoing case.The incident is one of several in which activists have faced criminal charges. In April last yea,r Lum Zawng and fellow activists Zau Jat and Nang Pu received a six-month prison sentence for defaming the Tatmadaw by leading a demonstration demanding safe passage and humanitarian access to 2,000 villagers trapped during a period of escalated fighting.Bawk Nu Awng says fear makes people reluctant to act: “Some are afraid of engaging in politics … My parents don’t want me to participate because they are afraid I will get shot or arrested.”Released during an annual presidential amnesty, Lum Zawng said arresting activists serves as a “psychological threat”.Seng Nu Pan says arrests only “push us to do more”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66f8231e6e99886a356c1799a85970037cd9eeb6/0_201_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71feaf756fe6518d9114eb0ffab0d3a","title":"ebola second case confirmed in goma","story":"World Health Organization confirms a second person has died of the disease in a major transit hub in Democratic Republic of CongoA second death linked to the Ebola virus has been confirmed in the densely populated city of Goma, located at the Democratic Republic of Congo’s porous border with Rwanda.The first case of Ebola in Goma – an evangelical preacher – contributed to the World Health Organization decision to declare the Ebola crisis in DRC an international public health emergency.The city, which has a population of 2 million, shares a porous land border with Rwanda and has an international airport. It is often used by international travellers as a gateway to DRC.The Ebola outbreak in DRC began exactly a year ago on Thursday and has claimed more than 1,803 lives, according to figures published on Wednesday, making it the second deadliest outbreak of the disease on record.The second patient began showing symptoms of the disease on 22 July, after arriving in Goma from DRC’s northeastern Ituri province, according to Associated Press reports.Aruna Abedi, in charge of coordinating the Ebola response in North Kivu, the worst-hit province, said the second patient had already been ill for 11 days before he sought treatment.“His was really a hopeless case, because the illness was already at an advanced stage and he died overnight Tuesday,” Abedi said.The case is not connected to the one previously detected in Goma.The escalating crisis has led to a row within the DRC’s health ministry, which is co-ordinating national efforts to contain the spread of the virus.Last week, DRC’s health minister Olly Ilunga resigned in protest against the country’s handling of the Ebola outbreak. Ilunga said international agencies were pressuring his government to allow the testing of a new vaccine developed by Johnson \u0026amp Johnson. The row over the vaccine trials began after Ilunga banned clinical trials of the new vaccine in DRC, according to Stat News.Ebola vaccines are difficult to develop because they have to be tested during outbreaks.In the previous outbreak in West Africa, one vaccine, produced by Merck, was successfully trialled in Guinea. The success of that trial meant preventative Merck vaccines could be given to citizens in the DRC and potentially contain the outbreak.But Ilunga has argued that trialling vaccines in Ebola-affected regions could erode public trust in the government.Merck’s vaccine requires only a single shot, whereas Johnson\u0026amp Johnson’s new vaccine has to be taken in two doses.Officials and NGOs fear that discrepancies in the vaccination schedules – where some people were getting one shot, while others were getting two – could fuel rumours about the vaccines in local communities.Ilunga also said that delivering two doses would be logistically difficult in a region where there is a high rate of displacement and where people frequently travel.“How can you, in an environment where people are traveling a lot, where people have no identity card, how can you organise a two-dosage vaccination in rural areas?” he was reported as saying. “You vaccinate somebody today and say, ‘Come back two months later’ … even from a logistical point of view, it’s not feasible.”Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, who is now heading the Ebola response in DRC said Goma had been preparing for more Ebola cases for many months, and that the latest patient would receive treatment at a facility in the city."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3907a894baec51a45f0e7a664a60e10b993372/0_62_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75023f2a80a5d29b4691209acf54da66","title":"honduras community coastal towns rising sea le","story":"Rising sea levels are destroying coastal towns in Honduras – and shrimp farms which export to the UK and US are making it worseby  Nina Lakhani in Cedeño, CholutecaEric Pineda runs a modest beachfront restaurant which serves up plates of fresh fish and rice – and faces imminent destruction.A recent tidal surge razed the nightclub next door, leaving a pastel pink ruin, and in the past two years, several other businesses between Pineda’s property and the Pacific Ocean have been destroyed by sudden waves.“Every year, the ocean is getting closer and higher. I think we’ve got a year – maybe two – before the water takes us too,” said Pineda, 24. “It won’t be long.”Golden beaches once helped transform this fishing community on the Gulf of Fonseca into a thriving tourist destination. Nowadays, however, there are barely a few metres of sand left, and rising water levels and tidal surges have wiped out roads, homes and businesses. Locals estimate that around a metre of ground is lost every year – which means this entire community will soon be under water. The same predicament is faced by settlements along the Pacific coast of Honduras, where land and its people are disappearing fast.In recent years, millions of people have fled Central America to escape grinding poverty, institutional collapse and untrammeled violence. But another factor behind the exodus has received less attention: conflicts over natural resources which have been intensified by corporate expansion and climate change.Sea levels are rising around the world, but in this region another local factor is helping speed up coastal degradation: swathes of mangrove forests have been destroyed to make way for industrial shrimp farms which have proliferated even inside protected reserves.Many Honduran shrimps are exported to the US and the UK, where they are sold in major supermarket chains including Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Marks \u0026amp Spencer.“The industry destroys huge mangrove sites promising development, but actually creates very few jobs – and actually increases poverty by restricting fishing access for locals,” said Dina Morel, director of a local marine conservation organization, known by its acronym Coddeffagolf.According to Morel, shrimp farms are routinely approved in protected areas and environmental violations rarely punished as officials often have vested interests in the profitable industry.“The consequences of losing this essential ecosystem are clear,” said biologist Víctor Bocanegra. “Environmental vulnerability, food insecurity, poverty and social decomposition, which all leads to forced migration.”Mangroves are essential to healthy, resilient coastlines. The sturdy trees protect shorelines from storms and floods, and help prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments with their intertwined roots.They are key factors in marine bioersity, providing food, clean water, shelter and safety for fish and invertebrates such as crabs, lobsters and prawns.In order to take advantage of this natural symbiosis, acres and acres of shrimp farms have been built inland in ocean inlets which were once safe havens for tidal waves. But the farms block the natural flow of water, causing high tides and storm surges to immerse beach communities instead.On Cedeño beach, Ariana Tees, 70, is frying fish caught by her husband, Manuel, 67, in a makeshift tarpaulin kitchen just metres from the sea. This is where they live, work, eat and sleep, but every month they are forced further and further back as the ocean inches closer inland.“Of course we’re scared,” said Tees. “But we’ve nowhere else to go, and there’s no protection from the government, not even a barrier.”Manuel, who has been fishing since he was a child, said: “Every year there is less fish, and the surges have nowhere to go – so the water comes here looking for an exit. We’ve woken up in the middle of the night surrounded by water.”The shrimp industry in southern Honduras dates back to the 1970s, but grew exponentially in the 1990s. As a result, in 2000, seven mangrove forests covering over 150,000 acres were designated protected reserves.Despite this, half the region’s mangroves were destroyed between 2000 and 2010 – largely as a result of fishing concessions sanctioned before the decree, according to research by Coddeffagolf.No one knows exactly how much of the protected areas remain intact, but satellite images seen by the  suggest the situation is critical.The extent of the deforestation can be seen from a mountain peak in San José de Las Conchas, 20 miles north of Cedeño, where the panorama reveals only slivers of protected mangroves nestled between massive manmade shrimp lagoons and the turquoise ocean.Locals say shrimp companies build farms in secret – hidden from view by a ring of mangroves – then obtain permits retrospectively.FundeSur, a social responsibility foundation created by the shrimp industry in 2014, claims to invest $0.02 for every pound of shrimp exported into health, education and environmental projects.But reforestation programmes, which require years of nurturing to ensure hardy shrubs, are rare. FundeSur did not respond to repeated requests for comment.“There is more deforestation than reforestation, that’s evident for everyone to see,” said Nelson Martínez, a grassroots organiser from Guapinol, a nearby community badly damaged by a tidal surge three years ago. “Unless the mangroves are saved, Guapinol will disappear too.”A thin strip of land sandwiched between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, Central America is especially vulnerable to the global climate emergency.Hurricane Mitch – the most deadly storm in the western hemisphere in over two centuries – left at least 8,000 people dead and a million others homeless and landless when it struck in 1998. It set the country’s economic development back at least 50 years and triggered the first wave of post-cold war Central American migration to the US.Yet, investment in climate mitigation and adaption programmes such as reforestation and flood defences is falling.Since a 2009 coup, a profusion of water-guzzling megaprojects – including dams, mines, and African palm plantations – has fuelled social conflicts, state repression and migration.Berta Cáceres, a Goldman environmental prize winner, was murdered in March 2016 in retaliation for leading opposition to the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the river Gualcarque, relied upon by the indigenous Lenca people for food, water and medicines.“The key issue connecting climate change and governments is water governance – the politics deciding who gets priority to enough good quality water,” said Professor Raúl Pacheco-Vega, an environmental politics scholar at the centre for economic research and teaching (Cide) in Mexico.In Honduras, the upshot of water politics is stark: every year during the rainy season, countless communities are cut off, lives are lost, and roads, bridges and schools are damaged. It is a cycle of environmental destruction that exacerbates poverty and drives migration as families search for food, water and safety.In October, six people were killed after two days of torrential rain triggered landslides and the River Choluteca burst its banks. The town of Marcovia, 14 miles inland from Cedeño, was inundated and its habitants forced to leave.Soon after, hundreds of people from the nearby city of Choluteca joined a caravan of migrants heading north through Mexico to the US border.Half a million Hondurans heading north have been apprehended by US and Mexican officials since October 2016.The motives for migration are always complex, but in this region, environmental factors are increasingly important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6aefd97f434b32265052e1764fac1503f843c8/0_34_8451_5071/master/8451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbb096b621ef37eae582ac11f56b1979","title":"safety blanket why more teenagers relying life coaches","story":"We think of life coaching as something for middle-aged executives, yet 17- and 18-year-olds are increasingly signing up. Is it for career advice – or because they help assuage loneliness?When Josh Dixon was excluded from school for antisocial behaviour, he thought the prospect of a happy life was over. He was in his mid-teens, after a period in which he had been bullied. “It felt like everyone had given up on me and that I’d either end up in a life of crime, like my other friends who were excluded, or in a dead-end job,” he says. Now 20, Dixon runs his own recruitment consultancy, which he says has an annual turnover of £2.5m. He credits this swift change of fortune to an unlikely, but increasingly common, path for young people: hiring a life coach.For Dixon, it was a crucial step in regaining his confidence. He was referred to a local coaching charity by a teacher and began going twice a week. “Initially, I was very sceptical. I was worried that whatever I talked about would be shared with the school and I didn’t want that, because I was ashamed of my situation,” he says. “But, after three months, the life coach began getting through to me and she broke it down, showing me the negative things I was doing and where it would lead me, compared with the positives I could gain if I just made different life choices.” These included continuing his education. “Little successes like finishing college were massive in building my confidence. She also made me realise that I didn’t need social media I didn’t need to keep comparing myself with other people and searching for approval,” he says.Hailey Yatros, a 26-year-old life coach, says the internet is a key reason why young people are seeking coaching. “This generation leans on social media as their means of connection to other people and they don’t really have anything else,” she says. “A lot of them get a coach to not be alone. I had a client once who had over 7,000 followers on Instagram and she didn’t have anyone in her life she could confide in if she needed to.”One of the most common questions Yatros receives from clients is what their purpose in life should be. “I laugh when young people come to me asking how they should live their lives, because you’re not meant to know that when you’re in your teens,” she says. “Your life purpose is meant to evolve over time and that question should be asked more than once. Lots of young people feel that, if they don’t get what they want right now, they’ll never get it. They forget they’re playing a long game.”Yatros is one of a new generation of life coaches in their 20s who approach their young clients with a deeper understanding of the issues they face, since they have similar concerns. Coaching is unregulated, so anyone could call themselves a coach, although Yatros took a qualification through a Dale Carnegie training course at 19. “When I started, I had clients who were in their 40s, but age has nothing to do with it,” she says. “It’s about your experiences and what you’ve learned. My clients didn’t care how old I was, because we live in a society where people are so thirsty for help: if you can help them, they’ll absolutely take it.”Life coaching is not to be confused with therapy. “You go to therapy because something is broken and you want it to be fixed,” says the life coach Michael Bungay Stanier, “whereas in coaching we have the philosophy that you’re resourceful, creative and whole and it’s about amplifying what’s working now. Coaching is often short-term – six to 12 months – and very positive and goal-oriented, whereas therapy can move much slower and much deeper.” Counselling and therapy qualifications are also more widespread than life coaching, with services accessible via the NHS in the UK – a provision that does not extend to coaching.Bungay Stanier is 51 and has been coaching for more than 20 years. He thinks the increase in interest among young people is not only down to the anxieties and loneliness wrought by social media, but also because the idea of actively pursuing a career has been destigmatised. “When I started, people would get a coach because they were a bit messed up or were struggling,” he says. “But now coaching is seen as a helpful space to figure stuff out – it’s almost a badge of honour to show people you’re committed to getting the best out of your life.” He also credits its popularity to a greater sense of questioning among young people. “When I was growing up, it was all about buckling down and working the system. Millennials, though, don’t want to put up with the bullshit or jump through hoops they’re always asking themselves: ‘What do I want?’ which is a profound and really difficult question.” Coaching can offer them different perspectives, he says.One year into college, Allison Rosengard, 21, who lives in Boston in the US, found herself asking what her life’s purpose would be. “I was anxious at the time, because my whole childhood was geared up towards getting to college, then once you’re there you’re totally alone. I didn’t have much direction,” she says. “Life coaching felt like a safety blanket, connecting with someone who had been there only five or 10 years before me, with similar experiences.”Rosengard’s coach was Kali Rogers, the 31-year-old founder of Blush, a service aimed at young women. “Women need a safe space,” Rogers says. “So, it was important for me to build a platform where they wouldn’t feel judged.” Rogers was also kicking against the stereotypes. “People think that life coaching is just for middle-aged men when I started, all I could find was male executive coaches. I wanted to break the stigma and show that you don’t have to be a man making a million dollars a year, sitting in a corner office, to have this luxury. You can be a 22-year-old woman at her first job and thinking: ‘Is this my life?’”Rosengard has been seeing Rogers for five years. “A good coach is a mentor in all things – they show you how to be an adult,” Rosengard says. “Initially, I would get a lot of questions from people asking whether I was seeing a therapist and why I needed it, but there’s a greater awareness now. As self-care becomes more popular, the surprised reaction to having a life coach has gone away.” Rosengard’s work with Rogers has led her into a career as a management consultant.Increasingly, young people are choosing life coaching itself as their profession. “The career is growing rapidly,” says Magdalena Mook, the CEO of the ICF. “We have 900 new members joining each year, with many Gen Zs training. They will be the future of the profession, as they really see it as a viable career choice.”Harry Langdon, 26, is based in Jersey and has been practising for three years. “I became obsessed with personal development and enabling people to get the best out of themselves,” he says. “Coaching seemed like the only career choice that would add a sense of purpose to my life. I knew I could connect well with younger people and that they would trust me, because I’m a millennial myself. The demand has been huge.”With prices ranging from £45 a session to £500 and above, it is cost rather than any stigma that seems the biggest barrier to accessing a coach. Gabby Carpenter, 19, hired a coach two years ago, when she was applying to get into university. “I had to use all the money I was making in my summer job to afford the sessions, but I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to my peers,” she says. “It might seem a bit woo-woo, but that investment gave me the confidence and structure to get into medical school and will pay off for the rest of my career. It sets you up for life.” Carpenter also believes that the skills she learned through coaching will help her as a doctor. “Coaching teaches you how to communicate properly and how to prioritise different aspects of your life, which is something that we Gen Zs have struggled with,” she says. “We’ve grown up with technology and distractions – we almost have to learn how to look someone in the eye.”With a new branch of his recruitment company having just opened in Manchester, Dixon plans to continue seeing his own life coach. “You end up building a really close mentor-like relationship,” he says. “She’s really helped me get that balance between ambition, purpose and life. Young people just need to slow down once we do, we finally have the space to figure out what we’re good at. From there, we can build much better, more considered lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cbb5675abae34334a944e4b9db7576954febcf6/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f8ceae9ccd1e65655cb6afef93f05f","title":"why would a woman marry her dog","story":"Elizabeth Hoad and her dog, Logan, tied the knot live on This Morning earlier this week – and they’re not the first to do soA woman married her dog. Eamonn Holmes gave the bride away. The groom, a golden retriever, wore a top hat. Love Island’s Kem Cetinay acted as a ring-bearer. It played out live and like a David Lynch fever dream on ITV’s This Morning on Tuesday. One viewer called it “deeply uncomfortable viewing”. “There has to be law against marrying your bloody dog,” tweeted another.There is, actually – the only legal marriage is between two human beings – but there were a few giveaways that this was not a solemn occasion. Alison Hammond, officiating, struggled to keep it together as she called for those present to voice any “bones of contention” as to why Elizabeth Mary Francis Hoad and six-year-old Logan Humphrey the Second should not be wed. No one said the obvious – “How long have you got?” – but Logan did offer a Tim-from-The-Office-style haunted look to camera.What would move a woman to marry her dog, even symbolically? Before the ceremony, Hoad, 49,  told This Morning that after four failed engagements, 220 dates and a range of unsatisfactory experiences in the search for love – men concealing wives, men her age pursuing younger women – she had given up on the male of her species.Logan, on the other hand, has been a constant in her life since she adopted him a year ago. “He’s saved me and I’ve saved him. I was broken before I got him.” It wasn’t just her, Hoad said – many of her friends preferred the company of their dogs to men. She is not even the first woman to marry one.Wilhelmina Morgan Callaghan, from Northern Ireland, got hitched to her yorkshire terrier, Henry, in 2009, because “dogs are better than men” and “I know I’m with Henry for life”. Lilly Smartelli, 55, of Phoenix, Arizona, told the New York Times earlier this year of her plans to wed Bernie, her poodle-cross, to know the joy of being married to her best friend before she died. Her only misgiving? The expense. “He’s always there for me. He listens, and he loves me no matter what. What more could a woman want?”Dog ownership’s links to lower stress, less loneliness and better mental and physical health well established, Hoad’s chances of living happily ever after might indeed be higher with Logan than if she settled for some desultory date. A 2010 study found that women might benefit in particular. Conversely, earlier this year, Paul Dolan – a professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics – asserted that men benefited from marriage where women didn’t.To even the score, Dolan wrote in response to the ensuing outrage, we “needed to start by caring less about what kinds of relationships other people choose to have, and how they live their lives. If they are not harming us, why should it matter?” One might put the point to This Morning. Tracey Emin famously married a rock “because it’s not going anywhere” – but a dog will actually love you back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b873400d3cdf2431628f54168fb930354beb239d/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e219c598efe027c1775e23250f450b7e","title":"severn bridge services named as worst on englands motorways","story":"Visitors criticise ‘grim’ toilets and fly-infested restaurant at services on M48 near BristolA motorway service station overlooking the Severn Bridge has been named the worst in England after visitors criticised its unwelcoming 1960s exterior and “grim and dismal” toilets.Norton Canes (Roadchef) services between junctions 6 and 7 of the M6 toll road in Staffordshire was rated the best for the second year running in the survey by the independent watchdog Transport Focus.The results are published on Thursday in the watchdog’s third annual Motorway Services User Survey, in which 11,600 drivers were questioned on issues such as the state of the buildings and toilets, food and drink, and staff friendliness.Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: “Motorway users tell us they have a good experience when visiting service areas, but it’s clear that many do not feel the experience is good value for money. They want pleasant, well-maintained facilities with good-quality food choices.“Motorway services continue to play an important safety role providing drivers with the opportunity to take a break. Drivers confirm they feel less stressed and are more alert after stopping at motorway services.”Severn View services, owned by operator Moto, is one of the smallest motorway services in the network. It has attracted a swathe of critical Google reviews one user claimed it was “tired and overdue a refit” and another that the restaurant had “flies buzzing about”. Other reviewers described the toilet facilities as “grim”, “falling apart” and “dismal”.“However, we will be redoubling our efforts in the year ahead to improve the services on offer at Severn View and expect to see a similar significant improvement to the one we achieved at Thurrock last year.”Luke Bosdet, an AA spokesman, said: “Motorway service areas have long faced an image battle with the motorists that use them. On one hand, they are a godsend for toilet breaks, relief from monotonous hours on the motorway and the chance for a nap or wake-up coffee.

Collins, it turns out, was one of 150 or so people who stood in the drizzle outside Brecon Guildhall this week hoping to get a glimpse of the new prime minister when he visited mid-Wales before Thursday’s byelection. But the crowd was left disappointed, with Boris Johnson only making a flying visit to an enterprise park on the fringe of the town rather than meeting and greeting the voters.“I was keen to see him and if I’d have had the chance I’d have liked to speak to him,” said Collins. “I waited there for nearly two hours and he didn’t turn up. The common man gets stiffed all the time. I’m voting for Mr Farage this time and if he turns out to be a liar, I won’t vote again.”In truth, the byelection is just about the last thing Johnson needs. It is his first major test as prime minister and if, as is widely expected, the Liberal Democrats win, his working majority in the Commons will be reduced to just one.The Brexit party candidate, Des Parkinson, a former police chief superintendent, called the Tory decision to put Davies up again as arrogant. “He’s doing the Tory cause here no good.”Activists for the Brexit party have flooded in. Diana Coad, a Tory defector from Berkshire, was running the buzzing Brecon campaign office on Wednesday – and making sure those getting on the bus had been to the toilet before departure. “They’re a smashing bunch. They come from all over,” she said.One absentee is Farage. The Brexit party MEP Nathan Gill explained that the leader was spending time in the US “with his friend Donald Trump” and also planning a much larger campaign.“We’re in general election mode,” said Gill. “He’s got to make sure we’re fighting fit and ready for the big one.” Gill said he thought there would be a general election on 24 October. “Put a fiver on it.”Of course, not everyone was impressed by the bright blue bus and the Brexit party bluster.Les, a sheep farmer, was taking his ease in the sunshine when the vehicle drove through Brecon town centre. “They’re the sort that are here today, gone tomorrow,” he said.Agriculture has been at the centre of this campaign with warnings of heartache for sheep farmers and even civil unrest if the UK leaves the EU with no deal.Les voted for remain and will be backing the Lib Dems at the byelection. “Boris is thinking he can get a deal. I very much doubt he can. With him in charge we’re heading for a no deal. That’s a bad job for us. All the work we’ve done will be undone. It will mean a big adjustment.”Three doors along from the Brexit party office, the Lib Dem campaign HQ was even more lively. The Lib Dems held this seat between 1997 and 2015 and believe they will win it back.Candy Piercy had just arrived from Buckinghamshire to help the party’s candidate Jane Dodds. A veteran of byelections up and down the country, Piercy said she was shocked the Tories had chosen Davies to stand again. “I wonder if it’s because they want to blame him for losing it,” she said.Kirsty Williams, the Lib Dem Welsh assembly member for Brecon and Radnorshire, said the campaign was not just about farming and Brexit.“But when they are not talking about Brexit they want to talk about public expenditure, about infrastructure, austerity and hyper-local issues such as is the library going to survive.”Williams criticised Johnson’s no-show in the town centre – a stark contrast to the efforts of the new Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who has visited four times.“Quite clearly this was a very stage-managed visit with extensive care taken to avoid scrutiny,” she said. “In a constituency particularly vulnerable to no-deal Brexit, local people are right to expect the Conservatives to explain why they are pursuing it. The fact they shied away speaks volumes.”Davies, however, said he did not regret standing. “The support I’ve had from the people of Brecon and Radnorshire has been immense,” he said. “These aren’t just constituents. They are former clients, friends, family. It was they that encouraged me to stand again.”He insisted he had not meant to commit an offence over his expenses – which concerned the submitting of fake invoices for nine framed landscape photographs, costing £700, to decorate his office in the town of Builth Wells.“I regret making a mistake, clearly. A mistake was made in my paperwork. This was a legitimate expense. There was no financial gain. It was a pure mistake and I’ve paid a heavy price.”Asked whether he was sorry for causing his new leaders such a headache, he said: “There are many things the prime minister will have a headache over. I’m sure this byelection is one of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6267b913b2b60563707fbb38990e6e5633c7c97c/0_288_5048_3028/master/5048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66c40d040dd651b596e3d2b3f4b0df3","title":"they could end up kingmakers again readers on future liberal democrats","story":"Readers share their hopes for a new movement in the UK, while others can’t forget the party’s part in austerity in the coalitionA week on from Jo Swinson’s election as leader of the Liberal Democrats, we asked readers to share their views on the future of the party.People from across the UK told of their hopes for the party under its new leader and the strength of the Lib Dems’ clear anti-Brexit line. While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

There are, however, three slight issues with this. First, it’s not clear how well the strategy works, second, the word actually means something slightly different, and that definition is not particularly flattering.Let’s start with how Boris Johnson’s team appear to view it: as, essentially, an economic credo, to be laid down in the autumn budget, of spending heavily on infrastructure while also cutting taxes.As such it combines fiscal stimulus – putting “rocket boosters” under the economy, as No 10 insiders have reportedly briefed – with a more nebulous attempt to gee up confidence in growth, similar to Johnson’s simultaneous attempt to increase optimism about Brexit.Economically, this sounds like a philosophy with a longer and fairly chequered history: Reaganomics.As US president, Ronald Reagan boosted growth with his combination of tax cuts and extra spending, but also saw public debt soar, and inequality widen, as the promised “trickle down” effect of tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy failed to materialise.The secondary element of the Johnson definition – talking up the economy – is at least closer to the accepted historical use of the word, though again the connotations are by no means always a compliment.In North American usage, “boosterism” is the heavy promotion of a place, or person, with a hint of hyperbole, even huckster-ish tendencies.In America it has been most associated with efforts to support small towns through new buildings, infrastructure or gimmicks. Historically it has been linked to attempts to inflate local property prices, perhaps excessively so, tempting unwary investors.These days it is often associated more with breakneck gentrification, a similar process except the new money, gimmicks and suddenly unaffordable property prices are intended to revitalise a once-prosperous area.Recent pre-Johnson uses of the term by the  have tended to focus on this sense of talking up a place or project perhaps beyond the realms of realism. One 2017 editorial managed to have its linguistic cake and eat it by using boosterism to describe Elon Musk’s over-promotion of his planned space projects.Perhaps the most famous, and fundamental, use of the word is less favourable still – in Babbitt, the popular if idiosyncratic 1922 satirical novel by writer and social reformer Sinclair Lewis.George F Babbitt, the eponymous protagonist, is a real estate salesman in the fictional midwest city of Zenith, where trade is bolstered by the city’s creed of boosterism – talking up its virtues to increase local fortunes. Such was the novel’s initial influence that for a period “Babbittry” was used as US slang for a sort of over-inflated sales pitch.Babbitt proudly wears a badge proclaiming his membership of the local Boosters’ Club, a sort of masonic lodge meets chamber of commerce, around which much of his business and social life revolved.The novel describes his disaffection with this cosy, bourgeois life. Babbitt initially preaches conventional morality, but then begins an affair.Eventually, and this could, arguably, be the point where the modern connection is broken, he has a crisis of confidence and resumes his conventional life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55876562bfd0917de37d2cfc323935d75a567962/0_133_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=989496430c59f44d93e8809000e0e326","title":"andy jamie murray doubles citi open","story":"Andy Murray and brother Jamie battled past French pair Nicolas Mahut and Edouard Roger-Vasselin at the Citi Open in Washington.The former world No 1 has so far been restricted to doubles action since returning to the game following his hip resurfacing operation in January, and played in the mixed event alongside Serena Williams at Wimbledon.Murray, who has suggested his singles return may be closer than he originally thought, produced a composed display alongside his brother as they progressed to the quarter-finals with a gutsy 6-4 6-7 (7) 10-5 win in a tie-break decider.A return to the hard courts in August appears in Murray’s sights, but that could yet be delayed until after the US Open.The 32-year-old’s last grand slam appearance was at the Australian Open in Melbourne, where he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round.Pairing with his brother was not a new partnership, the Murrays having played together at the Rio Olympics and also formed a prolific partnership during Great Britain’s 2015 Davis Cup victory.Jamie Murray, meanwhile, was looking to defending his ATP Tour title won in Washington last year with Bruno Soares.The opening set went with serve before the Murray’s pressure told in game 10 to gain a crucial break.The match remained a tight affair as the French pair held to force a tie-break.The Murrays saw two match point chances missed having been 6-4 up, the second with a wide return from the former world number one.Some more fine returns from the British duo saw another opportunity to break for the match, but again the Frenchmen responded to level at 7-7 before closing out to force a 10-point tie-break decider.Mahut and Roger-Vasselin then appeared to be in control after moving 5-3 ahead, only for the Murray brothers to respond magnificently and lead 8-5.Jamie Murray then served for the match, with Andy’s crosscourt forehand setting up another opportunity to take a hard-earned victory, which was secured when the return went into the net."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15a97533b92eb060382791b07eee5f9bb02bb5c4/669_146_3866_2320/master/3866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2705ddd4a125f02c3fd80c853857005d","title":"ashes melodrama round off world cup summer","story":"England’s World Cup triumph has meant a shorter, lower-key buildup to a series against Australia that promises melodramaThis is the summer that keeps on giving. It is debatable whether fans are ready for another gut-wrenching, umbrella-handle-chewing sequence of cricket matches, let alone the protagonists in the middle, who have rollercoasted as far as the final and semi-final of a World Cup, which came to its sensational climax little more than a fortnight ago. But the Ashes are here after a necessarily truncated buildup.There has not been enough time to squeeze in all the usual hype. The prospect of 5-0 has been only briefly circulated and no one is too bothered by that it is such a well-worn path there has been little talk of headbutting the line, elite honesty or the magic of the baggy green, though Cameron Bancroft did take the precaution of packing his Australian cap when setting off to play for Durham, a wise move as it turns out.There has barely been time to speak of sandpaper in advance of the Edgbaston Test when the three prodigals return to the fray for Australia. Bancroft is expected to be back at the earliest opportunity alongside Steve Smith and David Warner, which removes the charge that a nascent Test career was ruined for ever by the myopic sensitivities of the senior members of the Australia side in Cape Town. He has been batting adhesively in tricky English conditions for the past two or three months, so their selectors will surely seize this chance to clear some consciences and renew Bancroft’s international career.Meanwhile Ben Stokes is restored as England’s vice-captain. There is no time or inclination to agonise whether that is appropriate. The Bristol incident is now ancient history.So the buildup to an Ashes series, so often reminiscent of a poor pantomime accompanied by a bit of cod psychology, has been none the worse for the shortage of time. Instead, both teams have hurriedly assembled in Birmingham with more serious matters on their minds – such as what constitutes their best team. Neither side can be sure.Australia have two decisions to make: who bats at No 6 and who joins Pat Cummins, James Pattinson and Nathan Lyon in their bowling attack. There are three surprising contenders for that No 6 spot: Marnus Labuschagne – the definitive pronunciation will become clear once Jim Maxwell wraps his tongue round those syllables – offers a bit of leg-spin Mitchell Marsh, who enjoyed his comeback in the last Ashes series could give assistance with his medium-pace bowling and there is Matthew Wade, once the team’s wicketkeeper but now, following the modern trend, a prolific specialist batsman. The better the pitch looks for batting the more likely one of those who can bowl gets a place.More surprising to the casual onlooker is that Australia are highly likely to split up the quartet who were their wicket-takers in the last Ashes series two years ago. The expectation is that Mitchell Starc, supreme throughout most of the World Cup, will be on the sidelines, a handy bowler to find himself ferrying the drinks in a yellow bib. At best he is competing with Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle for the third pace slot.Australia are setting great store on Siddle’s effectiveness in English conditions, which has been enhanced after playing for Essex in the Championship. In the meantime they can legitimately claim that they have a fast bowling unit that is the envy of every Test nation.England had some tricky choices to make in this department but they have decided not to delay them. Their four-man pace attack will comprise Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Stokes. They have gone for experience rather than pace, presumably on the assumption there will be some assistance for the seam bowlers at what has become England’s favourite ground, the Brummie Colosseum. Both sides have the resources to juggle with their attack according to conditions and fitness. And they will surely do so.The England batting line-up is no longer a puzzle either but it is a curious thing. The Joes will be at three and four but the surprise is that Root will be ahead of Denly. What has happened – apart from being bowled out for 85 – for the plan to change so abruptly after that bizarre Test against Ireland?The hope is that Root actively favours this move and that it is not a case of him dutifully, though reluctantly, kowtowing to his senior advisers. Root is the captain and England’s best player and it is important he feels comfortable.The old Australian adage, promoted by Trevor Bayliss, that the best players always bat at three, may be outdated. Steve Smith now bats at four Allan Border seldom came out higher than that Steve Waugh was always at five or six. In previous Ashes series the Root at three conundrum might have been debated for a month there has been little time for it here.All is set for the off palms are sweatier and heartbeats quicker as more melodrama awaits on the horizon. Thankfully there has not been much time for too many predictions either but here are a couple. If England can get to 80 for two on a regular basis, then they will win the series but, as they say down under, that is a big ask. A personal guess is a 3-2 victory, given the frailty of both batting sides, the potency of their bowlers and the wonderfully devious Duke ball. But to which side?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b419dcc11ec9d4537895b129ab91498b560d1765/0_111_4126_2476/master/4126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6336e1bd4f3bd0c281400154ddaa6993","title":"charley hull womens british open golf","story":"Three years ago Charley Hull’s destiny appeared clear. She spent months driving to Woburn, past a giant poster of herself, for twice-weekly practice sessions as the Women’s British Open hove into view. At Hull’s home club the sense prevailed that this golden child of British golf was primed for major glory.A tie for 17th in 2016 was hardly a disastrous finish but it fell way short of expectations, primarily her own. From the same generation it was Georgia Hall who tasted major success first, in the British Open of 12 months ago. Neither is Hull the top-ranked British player in the world rankings, a position claimed by Bronte Law.It was little surprise, then, to hear Hull play down the significance of this major’s Woburn return. The backdrop will be serene when she tees of shortly after 7.30 on Thursday morning, just the way she wants it.“I’ve not been here as much. I took Monday off and didn’t come down and I’m only playing nine holes today. I’m just trying to get my work done and go back to the hotel. I like the way they’ve set the course this year. They’ve actually set it up a lot longer than last time, which is nice.”Hull said Hall’s success “made me work harder” but denied any element of professional jealousy. The pair are friends. Hull is open about a desire to win a major but the concept will not consume her.“It would be great,” she said. “I’d love to win a major, especially on home turf. But I’m just going to go out there and enjoy it and the more I enjoy it, hopefully it gives me a chance to win.“I can’t put too much pressure on myself because sometimes I feel like I do. I would really love to win this event, especially on home turf but again, I’m not going to say it’s my be-all and end-all because I don’t want to put pressure on myself.”Hull has recovered from a bout of food poisoning that affected her performance at last week’s Evian Championship in France.Lexi Thompson left her passport in her golf bag when exiting that event, causing a delay to the arrival in England for 40 players’ equipment. Thompson’s luggage had to be traced in a van that was carrying many sets of clubs.“I didn’t realise that I was going to cause so much delay in the bags for all the players, and I’m very sorry about that,” she said. “I would be upset, too, if I was the other players. I can’t apologise enough.”Another awkward moment arrived on Wednesday when Royal Porthcawl was confirmed as the Women’s Open venue for 2021. While clearly excited, the club’s captain, Rhys James, said this could be a precursor for the men’s equivalent heading to Wales.“The club is certainly interested in the potential for bringing the Open to Royal Porthcawl,” he said. “We all saw what a massive success the activities at Portrush have been in the last 10 days and working closely with the R\u0026ampA, with the Welsh government and other related organisations, it is certainly something that we would like to consider.”This was news to the R\u0026ampA’s Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, who, from two seats away, landed a knockout blow Andy Ruiz Jr would have been proud of. “We have no plans to take the Open Championship to Royal Porthcawl,” the tournament’s executive director said. “They’ve hosted the Senior Open, they’re about to host the Women’s British Open but currently the Open Championship is not in the discussions. We’re very happy with the 10 venues we have at the moment.” Ouch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7fe142c3d73b9448984ee6f4494f583ae698888/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3000da6286c8945bc72771e63e8ea509","title":"talking horses frankie dettori raacing","story":"Hermosa stands in the way of jockey hoping to win four consecutive Group One races in Britain for the first time in his careerHermosa, a dual Classic winner earlier in the season, is the major obstacle standing in Frankie Dettori’s way as he aims to win four consecutive Group One races in Britain for the first time in his career on Thursday afternoon, riding Mehdaayih.Hermosa took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket and followed up in the Irish equivalent before finishing only second in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. That was her third race in 41 days, however, and she has had a break since, while as a daughter of Galileo she is likely to find Thursday’s step up to 10 furlongs for the Nassau Stakes in her favour. Dettori’s partner, by contrast, is dropping back in trip having won a Group Two at a mile and a half last time.Her overall form gives her something to find, however, and Maqsad, who travelled strongly but found nothing from two out in the Oaks in June, could be a bigger threat to the favourite.Goodwood 1.50 Little went right for Sinjaari when he was sent off as the second-favourite for the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot last time, as he raced wide and alone from a high draw through the first half-mile and then had nothing left to give in the straight. His progressive form to that point reads well in the context of today’s race and the drop back to 10 furlongs could be in his favour too. The overall strength of the Ascot form was also underlined here on Wednesday when Sir Ron Priestley, who finished 18th, recorded his second win since.Goodwood 2.25 There is little to choose between Threat and Guildsman on their form behind Arizona in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot, where they were second and third respectively. Guildsman, though, has disappointed since when only fourth in the July Stakes and Richard Hannon’s colt looks to have the greater scope to progress.Goodwood 3.00 The King George V form from Ascot crops up again as Constantinople, the runner-up at the Royal meeting, switches back to Group Three company in a race that has been won by a series of future stars in recent years including Cross Counter, Crystal Ocean, Ulysses and Highland Reel. Constantinople has some way to go to match them but is on the right path and overcame a difficult draw at Ascot to beat all bar his better-drawn stable companion, South Pacific. Spanish Mission, the Bahrain Trophy winner, will be a tough opponent but Constantinople could well develop into a leading contender for next month’s St Leger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f4284f3a7cea4b823b2267be1820fb4648b39/1181_1041_3639_2184/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e282be98d954c046b234a79e2ded070","title":"deafness its part of who you are one mans journey to inspire","story":"Ed Rex has enjoyed some memorable travel experiences over the years. He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it.

Purnell said that people were “enjoying listening to us in different ways, with a record 75m downloads of Radio 4 programmes and podcasts this quarter”.One success for the BBC has been the rejuvenated Radio 1 breakfast show hosted by Greg James, which has attracted record figures on his watch by eschewing a celebrity-focused show and instead producing a format appealing to younger listeners and to their parents.Rupert Murdoch’s News UK has continued to invest in its signing of Chris Evans on the relaunched Virgin Radio, increasing the audience for his programme slightly, to 1.1 million listeners a week. His old BBC Radio 2’s breakfast show slot, now hosted by Zoe Ball, has performed less well. It fell by 700,000 listeners to 8.3 million, suggesting some had followed Evans to his new home.Global Radio, which faced criticism after sacking most of its regional programme hosts on its Capital and Heart networks in a series of job cuts this year, has begun to see the commercial benefits its relaunched nationwide Capital breakfast show hosted by Roman Kemp attracted 3.8 million listeners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb10c180d5e43cbc012fc00fff0d5eb87ff4cf81/0_20_3186_1912/master/3186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd440b0b05a4fc6ba1702e3eaf7e370d","title":"joe biden kamala harris and other 2020 candidates prepare for debate rematch","story":"Joe Biden was the central target as 10 Democratic presidential candidates took the stage for the second debate in Detroit on Wednesday, with rivals attempting to knock the former vice-president from his frontrunner status.Unlike last month’s debate in Miami, however, where Biden visibly struggled to defend his decades-old record, this time Biden was ready for the fight.Biden, 76, was flanked by a crop of younger and more erse candidates intent on casting him as a relic in their fight to be the party’s nominee to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 election.They included California senator Kamala Harris, who in the last debate skilfully attacked Biden’s past positions on ordered busing and segregation New Jersey senator Cory Booker, with whom Biden has sparred over criminal justice and other contenders who have so far failed to make a splash in the race, such as New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Colorado senator Michael Bennet, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, and Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard.The debate opened with what appeared to be a redux of last month’s searing confrontation between Biden and Harris, this time over healthcare. As Harris sought to defend a Medicare-for-All plan she unveiled this week, which would maintain a role for private insurance and be implemented over 10 years, Biden sensed an opportunity.“Anytime someone tells you you’re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it’s going to take 10 years,” he said.“To be very blunt, and to be very straightforward, you can’t beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan.“You’re just simply inaccurate in what you’re describing,” Harris shot back.Countering that Biden’s own healthcare plan would leave out roughly 10 million Americans, Harris added: “In 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.”But Harris, whose breakout moment in last month’s debate prompted a brief surge in the polls, was forced to weather other criticisms of her healthcare proposal.What followed was an unruly and often deeply personal debate over issues that included immigration, climate change and race relations.At nearly every turn, Biden and his past were brought squarely into focus.On immigration, it was Castro’s turn to land a punch when the topic turned whether or not illegal border crossings should be decriminalized. The issue, which has been elevated amid Trump’s policy of separating parents and children at the US-Mexico border, has ided Democrats.Biden dismissed the critique, pointing out he had never heard Castro level such criticisms of immigration policy while serving in the Obama administration.“It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn’t,” Castro retorted.The tenor was not unlike Tuesday’s debate, which exposed the sharp iding lines between the progressive and moderate wings of the party.But whereas the previous night saw progressive stars Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren defending the Democratic Party’s leftward turn, Wednesday was dominated by a clash of personalities and tactics. At times, it devolved into allegations of cynicism and whose framing was most disingenuous.When Gillibrand resurrected a 1981 op-ed in which Biden argued against expanding a child tax credit for high-income earners – suggesting his views had undercut women in the workplace – Biden asked why she had previously praised his work on gender equality.“I don’t know what happened except you’re now running for president,” Biden said.A similarly personal back-and-forth transpired when Booker accused Biden of constantly linking himself to Obama, only to dodge scrutiny over the more controversial aspects of the former president’s tenure.“You can’t do it when it’s convenient and then dodge it when it’s not,” said Booker, who also went after Biden’s role in authoring a tough-on-crime bill in 1994 now seen as the cause of mass incarceration.“There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine,” Booker said.Despite the onslaught, Biden largely managed to stand his ground.In many ways, the evening was a testament to the Democratic Party’s most pressing debate: whether to campaign on sweeping, progressive reforms or frame the election around the urgency of limiting Trump’s presidency to a single term.Biden has built his candidacy on the latter, telling voters the choice before America was to determine whether Trump would forever reshape the nation’s identity or simply go down as “an aberration”.But Warren, who has yet to share the debate stage with Biden, warned Democrats on Tuesday that the White House would not be reclaimed through “small ideas and spinelessness”.Trump dismissed his potential opponents on Wednesday.“The people on the stage tonight, and last, were not those that will either Make America Great Again or Keep America Great!” the president tweeted.In an impassioned plea to his colleagues, Booker warned Democrats that picking one another apart only worked to Trump’s benefit.“This pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn’t care enough – that to me is iding our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here,” he said.“The person who is enjoying this debate the most right now is Donald Trump.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52309a00c963b6a30ca1cce59c3dc3787b2b5bed/0_19_3252_1951/master/3252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec07f700a3b94ca0f2aea956518f3eda","title":"democratic debates 2019 live news tonight joe biden kamala harris cory booker latest","story":"That’s it from me in Detroit. Here are some of the key takeaways from tonight:The live blog will be back online tomorrow morning with our usual coverage, so be sure to return for that. And thanks for following along with our live coverage tonight and last night. The progressive group Democracy for America put out a statement declaring, “The real winner of tonight’s debate was Tuesday night’s debate.”“On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren not only delivered strong performances, they teamed up to articulate a bold, inclusive populist vision for the future of the country that Democrats need to beat Trump AND deliver a transformative win in 2020,” the group’s CEO, Yvette Simpson, said. “We didn’t get that tonight.”Simpson specifically said Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had fallen short on the debate stage. “Joe Biden repeatedly showed that he’s our party’s past, and failed to get the big win he needed to solidify his status as frontrunner. He was embattled by many challengers, which led to forced errors that will be difficult to recover from.“Kamala Harris struggled and will likely emerge from Detroit weakened by her failure to fully defend her record on criminal justice reform and her overly-complicated, ‘Medicare for All’ plan that was easily attacked from all sides.”Tulsi Gabbard kept up her criticisms of Kamala Harris in a CNN interview after the debate.Host Anderson Cooper replayed a clip of Gabbard pushing Harris about her record as California’s attorney general. When asked what she thought of the exchange, Gabbard said, “She never answered the question.” Gabbard also claimed many California families have “directly suffered ... because of the decisions she made as attorney general.” Cooper also referenced Harris’s post-debate comments about Gabbard. Harris dismissed Gabbard’s criticisms because she is an “apologist” for Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president who has used chemical weapons against civilians.Gabbard said Harris “resorts to cheap smears rather than addressing her record.” But when pushed on her 2017 meeting with Assad, Gabbard said she would never apologize for trying to prevent more US wars -- even if that meant meeting with a murderous leader.Cooper repeatedly pushed her on whether she recognized that Assad was a murderer and a torturer. “I don’t dispute that,” Gabbard eventually said. Donald Trump once again weighed in on the debates to unsurprisingly argue that he is the only candidate who can continue America’s prosperity. Ironically, the message came hours after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to reflect the slowing growth of the US economy.Kamala Harris also brushed off concerns about Joe Biden referring to her as “kid” when the two front-runners took the debate stage.The vice president greeted Harris tonight by saying, “Go easy on me, kid.” The comment irked some viewers, including this vice president at Emily’s List:But Harris told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that she didn’t pay much attention to Biden’s comment.“I didn’t really think much about it,” Harris said. “We’re both on that stage running for president … nobody’s going to define me on that stage.” Tulsi Gabbard went after Kamala Harris during the debate for her record as California’s attorney general. But Harris isn’t taking those criticisms too seriously.The California senator said she expected to take hits tonight because she is a “top-tier candidate” and many of her opponents are trying to make the fall debate. She went on to slam Gabbard as an “apologist” for Bashar al-Assad, noting the Syrian president’s use of chemical weapons against civilians. Gabbard met with Assad in 2017 and has since said he is “not the enemy of the United States.”“I can only take her opinion so seriously,” Harris said. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders may not have been debating tonight, but they still weighed heavily on Twitter’s mind. They were among the most-tweeted about candidates tonight:The 11th participant tonight seemed to be the heightened requirements for the fall debate, which lurked just offstage tormenting most of the candidates.Of those participating tonight, only Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have met both requirements needed to participate in the September debate. Two other candidates -- Andrew Yang and Julián Castro -- have met the donor requirement but have not yet crossed the polling threshold.For the seven candidates who have not yet made the cut, tonight could be their final debate, a possibility that appeared to weigh on them all night. It was certainly on the minds of Bill de Blasio, Kirsten Gillibransd and Tulsi Gabbard as they repeatedly launched attacks against the front-runners.When closing statements came around, most of those seven candidates plugged their campaign websites in the hope of attracting more donors and supporters. Gillibrand specifically asked for help “so I can make the next debate stage.” But that direct plea may have paid off. Gillibrand’s deputy communications director just tweeted this:The closing remarks are over, and the snap verdicts are in. Overall the wind seems to be blowing in Cory Booker’s favor after he took Joe Biden to task, but not everyone agrees:Meanwhile, some viewers called it for a candidate who wasn’t on stage:And get ready for this, Trump’s campaign manager is calling it for – can you guess?As the debate was still unfolding, Donald Trump’s reelection campaign put out a statement slamming Joe Biden for his reversal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.“Joe Biden was a big cheerleader for the TPP, and was even a ‘key surrogate for the Obama administration in their effort to build support on Capitol Hill,’” the campaign said in a statement, quoting from a 2015 NBC News story. “Until tonight, when Biden just said he would not rejoin the agreement as it was.”Biden said in response to a question about the trade agreement that he would “renegotiate” TPP, even though he was one of its main proponents as Obama’s vice president.But Trump now has his own record he has to run on when it comes to trade. His tariffs, which have proven unpopular with many of the farmers they’re ostensibly intended to help, could weaken this TPP talking point against Biden if he becomes the nominee.Immediately after the debate ended, pundits started making the case that Joe Biden had done ... better at least? After the former vice president’s disastrous first performance, expectations were pretty low going into tonight. But he did manage to fend off some of his opponents’ attacks, partly by accusing them of trying to simply attract attention by bashing him.“I love your affection for me,” Biden sarcastically told Bill de Blasio after the New York mayor tried to launch yet another line of attack against him.It’s hard to tell what Biden’s strategy will be for the fall debate, when many of these struggling candidates will have likely dropped out. But it’s worth noting that Biden has yet to face off against an opponent who has already guaranteed her spot in the next debate: Elizabeth Warren. Joe Biden was the last to deliver his closing remarks tonight, and got right to the last sentence before managing to both confuse (and amuse) everyone. After every candidate took the opportunity in their remarks to reel off their website and urge viewers to visit it, Biden looked into the camera and said “If you agree with me go to Joe 30330”. What is Joe 30330? It seems like he meant to say “Text Joe to 30330”. But instead, he’s accidentally created one of the most talked about moments of the night, at least on Twitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99bb6306e2270c9ca581c70807e49bf9b50571bd/0_26_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0523604444ea32bf40cfea5c8754a565","title":"from paperwork to pay outs seven common myths about life insurance","story":"Life insurance can be one of the most important things you’ll ever buy. So why do many people assume it’s only for homeowners with families?Kicking the bucket. Cashing in your chips. Going for a Burton. Heading to the great gig in the sky. Whatever you like to call it, death is a daunting subject few of us are fond of talking about. Our profound discomfort when it comes to discussing the “destination we all share” (Steve Jobs) also means we procrastinate or avoid things that focus on it.Take life insurance. Many of us would feel hugely reassured knowing that, should we pass on, loved ones would be financially secure, even enjoying the same living standards as they did before. Yet, our unwillingness to broach our departures (spoiler alert: it will happen) also means there are some widely held misconceptions about life insurance. Here, the  and Aviva embark on a debunking mission to separate fact from fiction …Myth 1: Life insurance is only for homeownersOne of the few things people know about life insurance is that many policies pay out enough cash for your loved ones to settle the remainder of your mortgage when you pass away, meaning your partner andor dependents needn’t fret about meeting monthly repayments.Myth 2: We don’t have any kids, ergo we don’t need life insuranceIt’s natural that child-free couples might question the importance of life cover. After all, many insurance policies are geared around ensuring families are looked after once the breadwinner has passed away. But taking up a policy can help, particularly if you have any mortgage debt that you don’t want to saddle your partner with.Myth 4: Life insurance is expensiveWrong! Life insurance costs considerably less than most people think. At Aviva, you can take up life insurance from just £5 a month.There’s good news for clean-living fitness freaks, too. As the cost of life insurance is linked to your state of health, if you’re in good shape (translation: don’t smoke like a chimney or adopt a diet that leads to future coronaries), your quote will reflect that.Myth 5: I’ll be drowning in paperworkGetting life insurance today can take as little as five minutes online. And don’t worry about insurance professionals digging into your personal life by asking questions about your dangerous base-jumping hobby either. At Aviva, it could take as few as five simple questions before you’re covered.As for wading through impenetrable legalese or having to badger your GP for medical records, if more information is required the insurance company can do this for you.Myth 7: I’ll be paying higher premiums because I used to smokeYes, smokers pay more for life insurance. But a cursory glance at the statistics reveals why: the lung-blackening habit accounts for nearly 80,000 deaths in England every year, with one in two smokers dying from a smoking-related disease.Just because you used to smoke, doesn’t mean your premiums will increase. Aviva will take into account when you gave up smoking and whether you have any smoking-related conditions, rather than arbitrarily increasing your premium.Aviva offers life cover from just £5 a month, so life insurance is less daunting than you may think, with flexible cover length, lump sum payouts and a hassle-free claims process.

Thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda.”Shortly after Washington announced the sanctions on Zarif, the White House’s national security advisor, John Bolton, said the US would renew sanctions waivers for Iranian nuclear programs that allow Russia, China and European countries to continue their civilian nuclear cooperation with Tehran. “I think the idea here is we are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely,” Bolton said in an interview on Fox Business Network. “So this is a short 90-day extension,” he said. A report in the Washington Post last week said the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, had argued for renewing the waivers over the objections of Pompeo and Bolton because if they were not renewed, Washington would have to sanction Russian, Chinese and European firms involved in projects inside Iran as part of the 2015 nuclear deal.The administration had first threatened to sanction Zarif last month, but relented to allow him to visit New York, while strictly limiting his freedom of movement within the city. During his stay in New York, the Iranian foreign minister is reported to have met Senator Rand Paul, who Donald Trump had said was seeking to help negotiations between the two countries.Zarif was the chief Iranian negotiator in the 2015 deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the US withdrew in May last year. In the face of mounting US efforts to kill the agreement, the Iranian diplomat continued to meet his counterparts from Europe, Russia and China, who have been anxious to keep the deal afloat.Tensions between the US and Iran escalated in May when Washington tightened sanctions, in effect barring all countries from buying Iranian oil.Last month Iran seized of the British-linked oil tanker MT Riah in the strait of Hormuz, apparently in retaliation for the UK seizing the Iranian tanker Grace 1 off Gibraltar. Zarif accused London of “ doing the bidding for the Trump administration.”“The Zarif designation is one of the most ridiculous steps I’ve seen this administration take. It won’t meaningfully affect Zarif’s diplomacy, it probably won’t result in much in terms of asset freeze or complications for him, and will annoy other world leaders,” said Richard Nephew, former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ade2b09ecd4b5bb6f808d0c0f5cf76a749befcd/0_0_2644_1586/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c81dc9c97ad6caafb7d70eae83fd02c","title":"who is hamza bin laden heir who sought to revive al qaida","story":"The son of Osama bin Laden, Hamza was seen as an ‘emerging’ figure in al-Qaida before reports of his deathOsama bin Laden’s son, Hamza, is believed to be dead, according to reports out of the US. He had been seeking to stage attacks on western targets with the aim of restoring al-Qaida’s status at the vanguard of extreme jihadist groups, after many years of decline and eclipse by Islamic StateHamza Bin Laden is the son of Osama Bin Laden and Khairiah Sabar, one of the former al-Qaida leader’s three surviving wives. She lived with him in a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where he was killed in 2011.It is believed that Hamza was aged around 30, with the US State Department listing his suspected birth date as sometime in 1989, but the department also lists an alternative birth date of 1986.He is believed to have been born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Bin Laden family have lived for generations and where Hamza’s grandmother and uncles, Osama’s mother and brothers, live today.Hamza spent many years after the 911 attacks, masterminded by his father, in Iran, where he and dozens of other family members of the 911 plotters were guarded by senior Iranian intelligence and military officials.Hamza was married to one of the daughters of a senior al-Qaida leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah. A video of Hamza’s wedding was found in the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed. His family also reported in an exclusive interview with the  in 2018, that Hamza had married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in the 911 terror attacks.Hamza has appeared in al-Qaida videos since he was a teenager. During the family’s time in Iran after 911, Hamza was mentored by Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, who was deputy to al-Qaida’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. In March, Saudi Arabia revoked Hamza’s citizenship after the US offered a $1m (£800,000) reward for help locating him.In their announcement of the reward, the State Department wrote that Hamza was “emerging as a leader in the al-Qaida franchise”.Hamza has made public statements urging followers to wage war on Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv and threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the killing of his father by US military forces.Recently he has been seen as a deputy to al-Zawahiri.According to letters seized from Osama Bin Laden’s compound after his death, Osama was grooming Hamza to replace him as leader of al-Qaida.Osama Bin Laden’s family has said that they thought Hamza had shaken off the ways of his father and they had been disappointed to learn he was emulating him.“We thought everyone was over this,” Hassan Bin Laden, Osama’s brother, told the  last year. “Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, ‘I am going to avenge my father.’ I don’t want to go through that again. If Hamza was in front of me now, I would tell him, ‘God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. Don’t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul.’”The death has been reported by several news outlets, citing multiple unnamed official sources. NBC News reported the US had received intelligence that he had died, citing three American officials. The New York Times, quoting two unnamed officials, also reported Hamza bin Laden had been killed some time over the past two years, and it had taken time to confirm the death.The report said the US had a hand in the death of the al-Qaida heir.Donald Trump was asked by reporters on Wednesday if the US had intelligence that Hamza bin Laden was dead, to which the US president replied: “I don’t want to comment on that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973354.1564636569!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents stressed out and fed up with high back to school costs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe average cost of putting a child into senior infants is  €340, according to a Barnardos survey. Photograph: iStockIrish parents are “stressed out, overburdened and fed up” by the high cost of sending children back to school, according to the charity Barnardos.In a report published on Thursday it said the Government could make school books free for all primary school children at a “minuscule” cost which would amount to just 0.2 per cent of the annual education budget.Its annual school costs survey suggests that parents continue to spend hundreds of euro getting children ready for school at the end of this month although costs have remained largely static when compared with last year.All told, more than 1,400 parents took part in the survey with the average cost for senior infants at €340 while parents of fourth class pupils said they would spend €380, rising to €736 for a child starting secondary school. Almost half of all those who took part in the research said they had to forgo paying bills and cut back on other costs to meet back-to-school costs while as many as 14 per cent said they would be forced to borrow to meet the expense.While 51 per cent of primary school parents and 46 per cent of secondary school parents reported an increase in the cost of school books, most of those who avail of a book rental scheme indicated that contributions would remain the same.The research found that almost 70 per cent of parents were being asked for a voluntary contribution while most schools continue to ask parents to buy crested or branded uniforms. ‘Anything but equal’“Every year for more than a decade parents have been telling Barnardos that their children’s back-to-school costs place a significant financial burden upon them,” Barnardos chief executive Suzanne Connolly said. “Once more it is clear that parents are stressed out, overburdened and fed up of subsidising our so-called ‘free education’ system. The substantial financial cost of sending a child to school means access to education is not free and anything but equal.”She accepted that developing a free education system would not happen overnight “but the Government must take the first step in creating a more equitable system”. “Providing free books for all children would cost a minuscule amount in terms of the Department of Education’s overall budget but it would have a transformative impact in terms of all children starting off with the same resources.”She also called on the Government to provide adequate capitation fees to schools so that voluntary contributions from parents could be made unnecessary.Capitation costsIn response, a spokesman for the Minister for Education Joe McHugh said the Government was “committed to tackling back-to-school costs”.He said the Minister was “making final preparations to shortly publish the student and parent charter Bill”, which would be “key to allowing students and mothers and fathers to have a say on many aspects of life in a school, with costs being a significant issue for discussion”.He added that over recent years “the department has been promoting measures to be adopted by schools to reduce costs, including of school uniforms” and he said there was a recognition of the “need to improve capitation funding for all schools”.Meanwhile, the average annual cost of third-level education is €4,611 per student if they live at home with accommodation costs adding between €3,750 to €4,219 to the total, according to new research entitled The Cost of Education in Ireland, published by Zurich.The research found that the annual cost of college student accommodation had increased by €777 this year compared to the previous academic year while transport costs have also increased with one in five students spending an average of €900 on transport each academic year.

But religion has a way of encroaching into your life, especially in the education system.”Fierce oppositionThe department’s move, however, was fiercely opposed by groups such as the Catholic Church, Education and Training Boards and the Teachers’ Union of Ireland.Documents obtained by The  last year show Catholic bishops warned the department that students who would receive tuition in an exam subject instead of religion would receive an unfair advantage.(Instead, they proposed that such students who opted out of religion should be offered a course in “religious heritage and values as well as ethics”).Education and Training Boards complained of having to offer an alternative subject without being given additional resources to do so.Religion teachers were also highly critical and insisted the circular was leading to widespread confusion by not clarifying the difference between “religious instruction” and “religious education”.While it said “religious instruction” related to the teaching of a particular religion for pupils of that faith, “religious education” was a much wider subject open to all pupils, regardless of their belief.Watered downIn October last year, in the face of this opposition, the department issued a “clarification” of its circular which watered down much of the meaning of the original.In a significant reversal, it said the State-approved curriculum on religious education did not contain any element of “religious instruction, formation, indoctrination or worship”.As a result, opting out of the subject and being timetabled for an alternative subject “does not arise”.However, the revised circular still included some significant changes.It said students who opted out of religious instruction (such as worship or faith-specific teaching) should be timetabled for alternative subjects, rather than doing homework at the back of class.It also said schools should proactively establish the wishes of parents in relation to opting out of religious worship or instruction.This should be integrated with the school’s processes for establishing subject choices generally.New documents, however, show most State schools are ignoring this revised circular.ETB schools, for example, have been recently directed by their umbrella body to “maintain the status quo in relation to the provision of religious education and opting-out arrangements”.The evidence on the ground in many community schools, similarly, is that the latest circular is not being implemented.ObstaclesSources in these schools argue that the lack of funding to provide for additional teaching for non-religious students is a key obstacle.However, schools are required to follow procedures set down in department circular letters.In a statement, a Department of Education spokesman confirmed that the circular applied to all “community and ETB post-primary schools”.Meanwhile, parents such as Helen O’Shea remain as frustrated as ever over what she sees as the violation of non-religious students’ rights and those of their parents.“Schools shouldn’t be allowed to cherry-pick what suits them when it comes to religion . . . It shouldn’t be so hard to uphold a child’s constitutional right to drop out of religion.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973477.1564598256!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools refusing tuition for students who opt out of religion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAtheist Ireland said the failure of State schools to implement these measures means non-religious students are being discriminated against. File photograph: GettyState secondary schools are refusing to implement a directive which requires them to provide students who opt out of religious instruction with access to another subject.Last year, the Department of Education issued a circular requiring State schools to timetable alternative tuition throughout the school year for students who opt out of religious instruction.This was aimed at ending the practice of assuming that pupils are predominately Catholic and requiring non-religious or minority faith students to do homework during religious instruction.The circular applies to State-run schools, such as community schools or those run by Education and Training Boards (ETBs), which account for about half of secondary schools or 160,000 pupils.Voluntary secondary schools, typically run or owned by religious organisations, are not affected by the circular.However, new documents show most State schools are not implementing the circular on the basis that they do no have resources to provide alternative tuition.ETB schools, for example, were recently directed by their umbrella body to “maintain the status-quo in relation to the provision of religious education and opting-out arrangements”. A spokesman for the department has confirmed that the circular, issued in October last year, remains in place and schools are required to follow it.The campaign group Atheist Ireland said the failure of State schools to implement these measures means non-religious students are being discriminated against.“The practical application of maintaining the status quo means students who exercise their constitutional and human right not to attend religious teaching cannot access another optional subject,” said Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland.Nessa White, general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland, confirmed that the umbrella body’s advice to schools has been to maintain the “status quo” in relation to allowing students to opt out of religious instruction.“Religious education is open to all students regardless of their religion or world view. In some instances, parents or students over the age of 18 wish to opt out of religious education. This is fully permitted in ETB schools. “However, our schools have not been provided with any additional resources to provide alternative classes to students who opt out. Our schools cater for these students to the best of their ability with the resources currently available to them.”What about community schools?Ms White insisted that ETB schools are “multidenominational and cater for all students regardless of their religious or non-religious beliefs”.Many community schools are also not implementing the circular, which also requires schools to proactively establish the wishes of parents in relation to opting out of religious worship or instruction.The circular states this should be integrated with the school’s processes for establishing subject choices generally.“Past practice of assuming that the pupil body is predominately Catholic and arranging religious instruction accordingly is no longer an appropriate approach,” the circular states.“ In a changing context the constitutional right not to attend religious instruction must be given effect through changed practices.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Boy continues to pose mortal danger to himself and others, child psychiatrist saysMost Leaving Cert students due to receive third level offers next monthDozens of parents protest outside meeting of Ratoath College\u0026rsquos board of managementAlcohol Action Ireland calls for minimum pricing as drinks become \u0026lsquomore affordable\u0026rsquoDepartment of Education directive was aimed at affecting up to 160,000 studentsBarnardos says Government could make books free at primary level at \u0026lsquominuscule\u0026rsquo cost to education budgetA total of 1,068 people, including 177 children, residing in emergency accommodationGovernment\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoiel-like euro-eagerness\u0026rsquo criticised by commentator in newspaper articleAlmost half of efforts to terminate lettings were deemed invalid, says tenancies boardAdrian Savage continued to view images of underage girls after being investigatedJudge says there is no empirical evidence to suggest a person with no previous convictions is more likely to tell the truthJudge rejects arguments the Minister erred in law or engaged in unfairnessReport suggested pictures of the British head of state had been \u0026lsquobanned\u0026rsquo from Stormont HouseHomelessness list down by 81 people, despite 73 families registering for first time in JuneChild\u0026rsquos mother tells Central Criminal Court that she will never forgive 49-year-old manFoster urges Taoiseach to \u0026lsquodial down the rhetoric\u0026rsquo as PM proclaims \u0026lsquocomplete impartiality\u0026rsquoA parent\u0026rsquos view: Being able to see what your children are doing on camera \u0026lsquois a comfort\u0026rsquoPM\u0026rsquos visit offers no clarity over North\u0026rsquos burning issues: Brexit and StormontJudge describes the case as \u0026lsquohighly unusual and exceptional\u0026rsquoJudge says Simon Gold\u0026rsquos crimes were \u0026lsquodevious\u0026rsquo and involved \u0026lsquogross dishonesty\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973515.1564602024!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"women can buy weekly limit of alcohol for less than 5","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe cost of alcohol has fallen to such a level that women can now hit their weekly alcohol consumption limit by spending under €5, according to a new report.  File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe cost of alcohol in Irish off-licences has fallen to such a level that women can now hit their weekly alcohol consumption limit by spending under €5, while the ceiling for men can be hit for less than €7.50, according to a new report. In its annual market review and pricing survey released on Thursday, Alcohol Action Ireland (AAI) also found there was little difference between the alcohol prices found in urban and rural areas and in big supermarkets and small off-licences. It said men were able to reach the guideline weekly consumption limit by spending €7.48, with the cost for women put at €4.84. Cider was found to be the cheapest strong alcohol on the market, with a standard drink selling in off-licences for as little as 44 cent, followed by beer, wine and a range of spirits. According to HSE low-risk weekly guidelines on consumption, men should drink no more than 17 standard drinks – with one standard drink being a small glass of wine or beer – while it is recommended that women consume no more than 11 such drinks. The AAI report said its research demonstrated “the remarkable affordability of alcohol to everyday shoppers” and it called for the urgent commencement of legislation aimed at imposing minimum prices on alcohol. The survey also highlighted what the AAI said was “the sophisticated retailing model deployed nationwide – urban, regional and rural – by the alcohol industry, with prices in convenience shops in rural towns in line with prices in big supermarkets in urban centres”. He said that given “the remarkable, universal affordability of alcohol in Ireland, any reduction in the cost would be utterly destructive of public health objectives and aims to reduce our excessive consumption”. There is a “clear and urgent need for the Government and the Minister for Health to immediately commence the minimum unit pricing of alcohol products, which passed into law last October but lies stuck in political inertia”, he said.He concluded by saying the availability of such cheap, strong alcohol was “killing our people. “It is simply incredible that economic interest would continue to be advanced ahead of a public health measure that would benefit the wellbeing of our youth and those at high risk because of alcohol.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973454.1564641028!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and coveney acting like fools over brexit claims bruce arnold","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour’, Bruce Arnold writes in the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney are “uncertain fools” acting like “wilful children” in the destruction of Anglo-Irish relations, journalist Bruce Arnold has said.The UK is currently engaged in a stand-off with Dublin and Brussels over the withdrawal agreement that would secure the UK’s orderly exit from the EU. London is refusing to accept the inclusion of the backstop while Europe is refusing to drop it. Arnold, in an opinion article for the Daily  published on Wednesday, delivered a scathing assessment of the Government’s policy and approach to Brexit. “This is tough right now, being a proud and loyal British subject who has lived in, and loved, Ireland for more than 60 years,” he wrote in the piece, headlined ‘Bought by Brussels, little Ireland’s ridiculous leaders have landed it in a Brexit crisis’. “What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour.“Whatever faults the British may have, they understand independence and freedom. I can understand why they mock the ridiculous behaviour of these two men.“Varadkar and Coveney are both members of Fine Gael, a party that has its roots in the fight 100 years ago to secure independence and freedom for Ireland. Yet now here they are trying to block the UK’s path to the same independence and freedom.”He described this approach as “painful and embarrassing stuff”, and was highly critical of the EU’s treatment of the UK.“It was bad enough these past months having to witness the humiliations of the journeys to Brussels of prime minister Theresa May,” he said. “Begging at the European Commission and European Council brought her nothing.“One cannot be surprised that Boris Johnson is so far refusing to go to Brussels. He is smart enough not to hazard a rerun of Theresa May’s ill-judged visits to the groups that became her tormentors. “The European Parliament had a brief walk-on part in the humiliations – to approve the draft agreement. They seemed from time to time to be sniggering behind their hands at this unfortunate woman who was betrayed on all sides.”‘Cheerleaders’ Arnold, who has written for several newspapers including The , the Irish Press, the Sunday Independent, and the , accused Dublin of acting as “cheerleader for these tormentors”.“Yet their cheerleading operates in terms that make no sense at all,” he said. “Varadkar and Coveney are increasingly uncertain fools. Their desire to be players in a game they don’t understand is causing their clothing to unravel and their minds to lose their way.“Their determination to work against the UK’s desire for a smooth and prosperous Brexit will in the end leave Ireland diplomatically estranged from its most important trade and political partner.“With some satisfaction I see that public opinion in Ireland is at last questioning their policies.” Arnold, who was awarded an OBE in 2003 “for services to Irish journalism and Anglo-Irish relations”, said Brussels was using the “iel-like euro-eagerness” of the Government “for its own ends”.He added: “Once Brussels gets what it wants, it will dump all interest in Irish concerns.“What Varadkar and Coveney are doing is helping Brussels to block the path for the UK government to implement the democratic decision of the British people to leave the EU. There was a referendum. The people gave their decision.“And yet a Dublin government which brags that it is republican and democratic denigrates this decision as populism. It colludes with the EU to try to have the decision dismissed and resisted.” Arnold’s article in the Daily , which is a Eurosceptic, pro-Brexit, and Tory-leaning publication, was also critical of the Republic’s decision to rerun referendums to ratify the Nice Treaty in 2002 and the Lisbon Treaty seven years later.He described the Lisbon Treaty as “a camouflaged EU constitution which would dissolve their republic into a new supranational state”. The Irish constitution, he said, “is now no more than a worthless gathering of sad memories”.“If you want to understand Varadkar and Coveney’s behaviour, the Lisbon sell-out is the key,” he continued. “Irish politicians are honest: when they are bought, they stay bought. “These uncertain fools have now led Ireland to be engulfed in a crisis as Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, seeks to lead Britain out of the EU either before or after an election.“Yet again we face a crisis of democracy, with little Ireland and the huge EU refusing to recognise the democratic decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. The ridiculous country in which I live is helping Europe in this abuse.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Lucas JacksonReutersWednesday night’s Democratic debate was always going to be the most compelling of this week’s two-night header in Detroit.All eyes were on former vice president Joe Biden whose clash with California senator Kamala Harris was the defining moment of last month’s debates in Miami.For much of the evening, Biden came under pressure from rivals on his previous policy stances from immigration, to women’s rights to criminal justice reform. Though his performance was shaky at times, he emerged from this debate in better shape than the first.The frisson between the two was evident within seconds of the two walking on stage. “Go easy on me kid,” said Biden as he shook his rival’s hand, a comment that was picked up by the microphones, and seen by many as patronising.As the debate opened, Biden and Harris plunged into a heated debate about healthcare.The issue is a weak spot for Harris who has been equivocal about her support for so-called “Medicare for All” since she began her campaign. Biden went on the offensive, arguing that his plan would build on Obamacare and allow people to keep their private health insurance if they wish – a key priority for many Americans who are reluctant to give up their private health insurance plans despite their misgivings about the US health system.Biden echoed the arguments of many on the moderate wing of the party by describing the single-payer system as economically fanciful.“The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $3 trillion,” he said of Ms Harris’ proposal, adding that Senator Bernie Sanders’ plan would cost $30 trillion. “Mine is $750 billion,” he said.ImmigrationBut as the conversation moved to immigration, it was Biden’s turn to feel the heat.For the second half of Wednesday night’s debate, the Democratic front-runner was under pressure as he came under attack from all sides.Probed by the moderators about why deportations rose under the Obama administration, Mr Biden said that he did not believe that people who crossed the border illegally should be allowed to do so – setting himself apart from those who said in the last debate that illegal immigrants should not be criminalised. “If you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back. It’s a crime,” the former vice president said.In particular, Biden hit out at Julian Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary under Obama who embraces a more liberal position on immigration.“We sat together in many cabinet meetings,” he said of his former cabinet colleague. “I never heard him talk about any of this when he was secretary.”Further trouble was afoot for Biden as discussion turned to criminal justice reform. In one of the most memorable moments of the night, Senator Cory Booker targeted Biden for his criminal justice plans, criticising his role in endorsing the 1994 Crime Bill which resulted in a sharp increase in the incarceration of African-American men.Biden responded by drawing attention to Booker’s record as mayor of Newark.CriticismOther candidates also jumped in, with Kamala Harris briefly reprising the debate on busing that dominated the first debate, reminding the audience that Biden sided with segregationists. But Kamala Harris’ record as attorney general in California also came in for criticism, as Hawaiian congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard accused Harris of blocking evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row, and prosecuting 1,500 people for marijuana possessions. “When you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people’s lives, you did not,” she said.Towards the end of the debate, Biden also came under attack for his position on women’s rights. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand cited an opinion piece written by Biden in 1981 in which he said that federal subsidies would discourage women from staying in the home and would lead to the deterioration of the family unit. Biden shot back saying that he had always supported equal treatment for women, accusing Gillibrand of criticising him just because she was now running for office. “I don’t know what happened except you’re running for president,” he said. Harris also asked why Biden until lately supported the Hyde amendment — a law that prevented the use of federal money for abortion. Biden failed to give a coherent answer.Overall, the second night of the Democratic debate had no standout performer, though Cory Booker arguably put in the best performance of the night.Joe Biden performed better than his first debate appearance in Miami. But questions about his acuity and age still remain. He stumbled at points and stopped speaking immediately when interrupted by the moderators, in contrast to the other candidates who continued to speak after their allotted time was up.In one unfortunate moment for Biden he referred to Booker as “president,” then correcting himself to say “future president.”Booker retorted: “I’m grateful that he endorsed my presidency already.”Biden may have salvaged his campaign, but serious questions still remain about whether he is the right person to take on Donald Trump. With several candidates expected to drop out before the next scheduled debate in Houston in September, the Democratic field will narrow considerably. But with the Democratic National Convention still a year away, it is still all to play for as Democrats decide on their candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

That amount of money could kill them.”She added: “It\u0027s £2 for a bag of mamba. If people give even £3 for a meal deal, how do they know it\u0027s going to go on that?”In 2016, an unnamed man was reported to be earning just £12,000 less per year than the prime minister through begging in Wolverhampton.While just three years prior Simon Wright made headlines when he was banned from begging in London after magistrates heard he was earning up to £52,000-a-year begging in Putney.Wimbledon Magistrates Court heard Wright positioned himself outside a Natwest branch in the High Street with a hand-written sign that read “homeless and hungry” before returning each night to his £300,000 property in nearby Fulham.Ms Pike said it was important to distinguish between street beggars and iniduals who are genuinely homeless.She said: There are two pools of thinking, people tend to think people who beg and rough sleepers are all part of the same group, there is no middle ground and there needs to be. We need to be able to separate that.”The remarks were echoed by housing charities which stressed street beggars may not necessarily be rough sleepers.A spokesman for Framework said: Most of the people we see begging are not homeless and do have somewhere to stay - but that doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t have serious problems in their lives or that they don\u0027t need or deserve help.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Of those surveyed, 32 per cent said they had not visited a butcher while 23 per cent had never been to a greengrocer.Asked whether they had ever visited a launderette, more than half said no, while 44 per cent said they had never been to a florist and 41 per cent said they had not gone to a key-cutter.There has been rising concern about the high street, with a report by Retail Economics predicting half of UK retail transactions will be online within a decade, up from about a fifth currently.In the past 10 years, a string of big chains have disappeared, including Woolworth, BHS, Toys R Us and ­Maplin. House of Fraser fell into ­financial difficulties but was rescued by Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct owner, who pledged to make it the Harrods of the High Street.National DIY chain Homebase announced it was to close dozens of stores and in May, Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would shut 110 more stores, while profits plunged at John Lewis last year.The survey found 75 per cent of children said their parents\u0027 shopping usually came from a supermarket and two fifths said their parents shopped online. Online shopping habits varied geographically, the poll found, with half of children in London saying their family shopped online, compared with just over a quarter of children in Wales.Yet nearly three quarters of those surveyed said they would prefer to buy items in a shop than online. The most popular reason given was to explore different items, followed by feeling grown-up and being able to talk to people.Nationwide, which has promised not to leave any town or city where they are currently based until at least May 2021, commissioned the research.MPs said this year that towns must give themselves a unique selling point. A report in February by a government communities committee urged towns to fight online shopping by adopting aspirational, authentic brands to ­attract shoppers. The report warned ghost towns would result unless the Government, councils, retailers, landlords and local communities acted.Retail and Consumer industryThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The breakfast show now has an audience of 1.9 million, a rise of 249,000 year-on-year. Overall, the classical station increased its audience by 474,000 to 5.6 million listeners per week.BBC Radio 4\u0027s audience dipped by 438,000 over the last three months, although it is stable year-on-year. The Today programme lost 312,000 listeners over the same period, but is slightly up on this time last year.The biggest breakfast-time loser is Zoe Ball. When she took over from Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2 in January, ratings remained stable. But within weeks, listeners began switching off. The audience has dropped by 781,000 in the last quarter, from 9,047 million to 8.266 million. Zoe Ball on her first morning hosting the BBC 2 Breakfast ShowThat is the lowest Radio 2 breakfast audience in 11 years and means it is no longer the most listened-to show on UK radio. Ball has been leapfrogged by Ken Bruce and his mid-morning programme, which has 8.49 million listeners. Radio 2\u0027s overall audience fell by five per cent to 14.59 million, its lowest point since 2012, after a series of changes to the established line-up. The station lost Simon Mayo, while Sara Cox and Jo Whiley began new shows and Rylan Clark-Neal joined the Saturday line-up.A Radio 2 spokesman said audience churn is to be expected when major schedule changes are made.Across the airwaves, classical music is doing well. Radio 3\u0027s audience rose by six per cent year-on-year to 2.03 million, while Scala amassed 258,000 listeners in its first months on air.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The sales of iPhones took a 12 per cent tumble and the company’s earnings fell by a similar amount. Yet the shares jumped in after-hours trading.\u0026nbspAs ever, this was partly down to expectations: Wall Street had forecast a deeper e.\u0026nbspThe markets were also buoyed by what chief\u0026nbspexecutive Tim Cook had to say about the future, with new iPhone models on the way, together with his talk about a “marked improvement” in China.\u0026nbspTrump attacks Apple’s plea for tariff waivers on new Mac Pro partsApple buys Intel 5G modem business, dropping major hint at new iPhoneNew iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakBut with this latest set of figures, the company also crossed a rubicon. Its signature product, for the first time in years, provided\u0026nbspless than half the firm’s revenues in a three-month quarter. The latest covered\u0026nbspthe period up to 29 June. It is\u0026nbspthe third of Apple’s financial year and in it the iPhone accounted for 48 per cent, compared to 55 per cent over the same period in 2018.\u0026nbspIts dwindling sales might have been taken more seriously but for the fact that they were more than offset by growth in other areas, helping Apple to post a modest increase in overall revenues – $53.8bn (£44.1bn) against $53.3bn last time.\u0026nbspThe boom in Apple services –\u0026nbspincluding music subscriptions, the App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple TV –\u0026nbsphas been a longstanding theme, and that continued.\u0026nbspMore than 400 million people now have some sort of subscription with the company. It will hope to add to their number through Apple TV+, a new streaming service coming in the autumn, although it is entering an increasingly crowded field at a time when even the mighty Netflix is starting to encounter some price resistance, at least in North America.But that’s far from the only new string being added to the company’s bow. A credit card is coming in August too. It’s not only Amazon that could easily be renamed World Domination Enterprises. Apple is also sending its tanks out to occupy an ever-growing number of lawns and causing shivers down the spines of an ever-growing number of competitors.\u0026nbspDespite all this activity, services didn’t even make the biggest noise in this\u0026nbspset of results, as they have become accustomed to doing. Nor did\u0026nbspMacs or iPads, both of which grew handily. The unit shouting loudest was, in fact, “Wearables, Home and\u0026nbspAccessories” which recorded growth of 48 per cent.\u0026nbspThis is made up of a rag bag of different product lines including smart speakers, headphones, and especially the Apple Watch, which has started to come (very) good for the company after a decidedly rocky start.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It’s certainly become a lot bigger under his successor Tim Cook, who might just be the better businessman and now has Wall Street eating out of his hands.

As the port with the\u0026nbspshortest distance to Northern Ireland,\u0026nbspthe harbour had once been the lifeblood of the village. Long before email, 10,000 mail packets made their way from Portpatrick and across the sea to Donaghadee.\u0026nbspThe railway came to Portpatrick in 1862, shortly before the cross-channel steamer services moved to nearby Stranraer. When the government switched the mail service to Stranraer, passengers on the railway between the two villages dwindled, and Portpatrick harbour became the preserve for a small fleet of fishermen and some pleasure boats.\u0026nbspHow the look of council estates has changed over a centuryLabour vows to end ‘rip-off’ by ensuring councils take back servicesThird of councils fear they will be unable to provide vital services“Steam killed the village for sailboats coming in,” Robert Erskine, a lifeboat coxswain since 1984, told me in 2016. “It’s now more a leisure harbour. But it’s still very important as it’s the centrepoint of the village.”I was in Portpatrick to report on a\u0026nbsphistoric moment for residents. In 2015, frustrated at the lack of maintenance by the harbour’s private owners, local people made the decision to organise as a community benefit society, an organisation accountable to the community, and sell shares to buy their harbour and secure the village’s future.\u0026nbspThree and a half years later, the community-owned harbour has catalysed the regeneration\u0026nbspof several other buildings in the village. The society has acquired a row of toilets and a patch of land near the harbour from Dumfries and Galloway council, at a price of £1, to save the facility from closure. Two people have been employed directly by the society to service the toilets.\u0026nbspThe society has now applied to transfer the local village hall into community ownership under the Communities Empowerment Act Scotland 2015.“People are coming to the village and making the comment that they can see the changes,” says Calum Currie, chair of the Portpatrick\u0026nbspCommunity Benefit Society. “The harbour is much busier. We have now made the harbour a venue from which we’re looking at doing more festivals and events.”In England, there are more than 6,300 assets like the Portpatrick harbour\u0026nbspin community ownership, according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and Power to Change. These community halls, sports centres, parks and other spaces contribute nearly £220m to the UK economy every year, its research shows.Three-quarters of these assets are reported to be in good financial health. And the sector is growing: one third of the\u0026nbspassets came into community ownership in the last year.“This is a surprisingly good story,” says Ailbhe McNabola, head of\u0026nbspresearch\u0026nbspat Power to Change. “The proportion of assets in good financial health is really promising. Councils are under huge pressure financially, but with the assets they can dispose of, they are thinking about the community first and how they can continue to provide access.”\u0026nbspUnder the Localism Act of 2011, community organisations have the right to delay the sale of a building or land so that they can develop a bid. They might also register the building or space as an “asset of community value” in order to be alerted if the asset comes up for sale. In Scotland, the government has conferred additional rights to community groups to buy large landholdings and estates through a Right to Buy, which enables the forced disposal of a property if it is abandoned, neglected or detrimental in some way.Eighty per cent of the assets transferred into community ownership are community centres such as village halls. When these are taken out of the equation, the rate of community asset transfer for other assets such as sports centres, parks, open space and libraries is increasing even faster, McNabola says.\u0026nbspIn Wolverhampton, the council has given a longterm lease for a piece of land and stadium to Bilston Town Community Football Club, giving it ownership over an asset that has helped the club survive during a difficult financial period. In Liverpool, a piece of neglected local authority land was sold to Squash, a community food initiative, and is now occupied by modern cafe, gallery and gardens. Meanwhile in Dauntsey Lock, Wiltshire, residents registered a local pub, The Peterborough Arms, as an asset of community value to give them the time to raise £225,000 to buy it from private owners who wanted to turn it into residential property.“It’s a combination of a good policy environment, which has raised the profile of community asset transfers, and austerity, where councils have had their budgets cut are not able to maintain buildings in the way they once did,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays. She notes the\u0026nbspexample of community-run libraries, which have grown from very small numbers to an estimated 500 in England by the end of 2018.These community asset transfers are part of a much broader picture of councils selling assets to stay in the black as their grant from the central government has shrunk by 60 per cent since 2010. In March, an investigation by the Bureau Local and Huffington Post revealed that local authorities have sold more than 12,000 public spaces since 2014-15.\u0026nbspBut McNabola\u0026nbspsays that when asset transfers are done well, everyone benefits. “You have to make sure that the assets handed over are not a liability and that councils are working with communities in a sustainable way,” she says. “A council should be there to help with the self-realisation of the community, not to make money.”\u0026nbspThe transition from owning a community asset to doing buildings and facilities management can be a challenge for community organisations. “It’s about engaging with the community early on, thinking about governance and making sure the group has the support they need,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays.Austerity-hit councils in \u0027Great British selloff\u0027 of public buildingsDumfries and Galloway Council says that its approach to community asset transfer is to support communities to develop their ideas to deliver services with and for the local community. “At a time of austerity, when councils cannot deliver all of the traditional services, we work with communities to help them realise their ambitions and provide local solutions to local issues,” a spokesperson said. The council noted that it only transfers a property when it can be assured that the business plan is supported by the local community and able to generate a sustainable income.Currie believes the Portpatrick\u0026nbspHarbour Community Benefit Society now has\u0026nbspa stable of assets that will support its acquisition of the village hall – and help them break even in the first year.\u0026nbsp“For a community group to take on a village hall takes a lot of planning and involvement,” he says. “But we have the support of the village.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the rollout of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full rollout of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.Created with Sketch.

As a result, the cap will be increased from 1 October, with prepayment customers paying roughly £1 a week more based on current prices.“A price cap set too low may lead to suppliers leaving the market, reducing both competition and consumer choice. Even with the revised level of the price cap, prepayment customers will still be protected from unnecessarily high prices,” the CMA said.Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Spotify shares fell 5 per cent following the update for investors on Wednesday.“We missed on subs. That’s on us,” Spotify’s founder and chief executive Daniel Ek said, referring to subscriber numbers. He said the company expects to “make up lost ground before year-end”.Spotify is still the most popular music streaming service in the world, with almost double the number of paid-up members of its nearest rival Apple.Revenue from subscribers, which accounts for around 90 per cent of Spotify’s overall revenue, rose to €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in the second quarter.Created with Sketch.Spotify tips and tricks Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Search more accuratelyYou can improve the accuracy of your searches by adding extra information, such as dates, genres and albums.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The cap will also be raised.The Competition and Markets Authority introduced the cap on gas and electricity prices in 2016 to protect customers on prepayment meters as they are not able to switch suppliers as easily as other customers.The cap was due to be lifted at the end of 2020, as the CMA expected that by then the rollout of smart meters, replacing prepayment meters, would be complete and increased competition would lead to lower prices.But following a review, the CMA said: “It now recommends that Ofgem should continue to protect prepayment customers once the CMA’s cap expires, given that the full rollout of smart meters will not have completed by 2020.”The regulator did not say how long the extension should be.Created with Sketch.

As a result, the cap will be increased from 1 October, with prepayment customers paying roughly £1 a week more based on current prices.“A price cap set too low may lead to suppliers leaving the market, reducing both competition and consumer choice. Even with the revised level of the price cap, prepayment customers will still be protected from unnecessarily high prices,” the CMA said.Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Del Rey is also set to release a new single with Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande for the forthcoming Charlie’s Angels film, coming out in November. \u0026nbspNorman F***ing Rockwell will be released on 30 August.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As Ms Carzon observed the dolphin family, they found the whale rarely left his adopted mother’s side.Such a trio is rarely seen in the wild, as dolphin mothers typically care for only one infant at a time.The whale also competed with its adopted sibling for attention and began to behave like the dolphins.He would regularly socialise with other young dolphins and join them in surfing and leaping into waves.In the study, published in the journal\u0026nbspEthology, the authors suggested the foster mother’s “inexperience and personality” may have contributed to the adoption.They also said the adoptee’s “persistence in initiating and maintaining an association” with the adoptive mother “could have played a major role in the adoption’s ultimate success”.The melon-headed whale and bottlenose dolphin mother stayed together for almost three years.They stuck together after the mother’s biological calf vanished for unknown reasons at around one-and-a-half years old.The adopted calf disappeared around the time he would have weaned.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Department for Transport described the drop as statistically significant.That came despite increases in cyclist numbers in major UK cities, including London where cycling journeys grew by 5 per cent last year.Campaigners pointed to the disparity between cycling rates in the capital and the rest of the country as proof that more money was needed to improve road safety and encourage greater numbers onto their\u0026nbspbikes.The government currently spends £7 per head per year on cycling in England, excluding London - less than half the £18 per head spent in the capital.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Surprisingly, the City of London recorded the largest decrease in\u0026nbspcyclists, from 22 per cent to 11 per cent.However, the report cautioned that the small sample size of the central London district may have skewed the result.Men continue to outnumber women on bikes by more than two-to-one, the report showed. A\u0026nbspperception that it is too dangerous to ride a bike is still the main reason people are put off switching to two wheels.Male cyclists made an average of 25 trips per year compared with just 10 trips for women, with those aged 40-49 most likely to cycle.Painted bike lanes ‘a waste of public money’, cycling experts sayThe survey suggested little progress has been made nationally in promoting cycling as an efficient, healthy and cost-effective mode of transport.Despite efforts to increase cycling uptake to tackle air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, just 2 per cent of all trips made in England are completed by bike – amounting to just 1 per cent of the total distance travelled.That compares with close to two-thirds (61 per cent) of journeys being made by car and around a quarter (27 per cent) on foot.Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK’s head of campaigns, said: “Despite government recognising the need to encourage and enable more people to cycle regularly for health and environmental reasons, unfortunately the proportion of trips made by bike has remained largely static for 20 years.\u0026nbspWhen asked what stops people from cycling more often, the common response is that it’s too dangerous.The reality is that cycling is not a dangerous activity, but it’s this perception which needs to be tackled.\u0026nbspTo do this, we need to build cycling routes separated from motor traffic, safe for a 12 year old to ride along. That requires at least a doubling of current spending on cycling and walking, which must be a priority for the Department for Transport in the forthcoming Spending Review.”Department for Transport\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even countries that do apply a time limit to immigration detention do not operate such a short one.”A number of high-profile Conservative MPs have told The Independent the Home Office must urgently reconsider this decision.Immigration detainees\u0026nbspheld for more than 28 daysFormer Brexit secretary David Davis said it was a “very bad decision”, adding: “I urge the home secretary to review it as a matter of urgency, since I believe that parliament will take a different view to the government on this matter.”Describing the absence of a time limit as “clearly perverse”, Mr Davis said: “People who have been human trafficked are effectively being treated as criminals with indeterminate sentences. What really puts the public at risk is the Home Office’s poor administration of its deportation policy.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, it is by no means clear that people who are held in detention centres are those who are a real risk to the public, since there is evidence of people who are a risk being released early.”Andrew Mitchell, former international development secretary, said: “I am sure that the Home Office will want to think carefully about this because when the matter comes before the House of Commons, as it undoubtedly will, the House of Commons may well take a different view.”Home Office should no longer have power to detain people, MPs sayFormer attorney-general Dominic Grieve said he was sorry to hear the Home Office’s response, adding that failing to implement a time limit was “leading to injustice”.\u0026nbspHe continued: “It was never going to be a blanket demand, but we need an adequate limit, rather than the system which prevails at the moment, where people can be detained for very long periods even though the Home Office doesn’t want it, and then they eventually release the people back into the community.”The Independent recently reported on the case of a Zimbabwean man who\u0026nbspwas detained under immigration powers for more than four years – an experience he said made him feel suicidal.In April, the prisons watchdog revealed self-harm among detainees in Colnbrook removal centre, one of Britain’s largest detention centres, had surged threefold in the last three years despite a considerable drop in the population.People detained under Immigration Act powers in 2018In response to Ms Nokes’ letter, chair of the committee, Harriet Harman, said: “Home Office immigration detention is arbitrary, unfair and breaches human rights. Repeated detention and release, which characterises the system, shows that it must be reformed.“Parliament will have the opportunity to consider changing the law to protect people from arbitrary detention when the Immigration Bill is brought back.\u0026nbspI’m hopeful that with the strong cross-party backing for the proposals from our committee and the Home Affairs Committee it will do so.”Pierre Makhlouf, assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, condemned\u0026nbspthe Home Office’s “cavalier attitude to the deprivation of liberty”,\u0026nbspadding: “The government\u0026nbspignores the fact that people are held in immigration detention sometimes for months and years when their removal cannot be enforced.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“No one is detained indefinitely. Most people detained under immigration powers spend only short periods in detention.\u0026nbsp“We have made significant improvements recently, but we are committed to doing more and introducing further alternatives to detention, increasing transparency and improving the support available for vulnerable detainees.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The two parties together will hold 321 seats, as against 320 for everyone else.\u0026nbspThe position isn’t quite as precarious for the new prime minister as that seems, however. In most cases, Johnson will be able to rely on the support of Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, who had the Tory whip removed this month when he was charged with sexual assault, an accusation he denies.\u0026nbspThe reason Jeremy Corbyn held back from tabling a motion of no confidence in Johnson’s government last week was that it was certain to be defeated: in addition to Elphicke, Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, voted with Theresa May in the last vote of no confidence in January, and Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, former Labour MPs, abstained.\u0026nbspYet the arithmetic of a future vote of no confidence, if it were designed to stop Johnson pursuing a no-deal Brexit, is unpredictable, and every single vote could count.\u0026nbspIf Jane Dodds, the Liberal Democrat candidate and the party’s leader in Wales, wins the by-election, it will tilt the balance in the House of Commons a bit further against a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerSo what is going to happen? Only one opinion poll has been carried out in the constituency, by Number Cruncher Politics, which put Dodds on 43 per cent, 15 points ahead of Chris Davies, the Tory candidate, whose conviction for expenses fraud caused the by-election.\u0026nbspDes Parkinson, the Brexit Party candidate, was in third place on 20 per cent, with Labour’s Tom Davies trailing on 8 per cent.\u0026nbspBut that poll was carried out between 10 and 18 July, a week before Johnson became prime minister, so it is possible that Davies might benefit from the national “Boris bounce” in the Tories’ favour. In national opinion polls there has been a shift of about 5 per cent of voters from the Brexit Party to the Tories. That is not going to be enough to hold the seat, which makes the Tories’ decision to allow Davies to fight the seat – after he was dismissed by a petition signed by 19 per cent of his constituents – all the more curious.\u0026nbspWhat does the Remain parties’ pact for the Brecon by-election mean?The by-election has also been hailed as a test of a common front among the Remain parties, because Plaid Cymru and the Green Party decided not to contest the seat to give the Lib Dems a free run. As Plaid Cymru won a mere three\u0026nbspper cent of the vote in the 2017 election, and the Greens didn’t stand, this wasn’t such a great sacrifice – and in any case the Lib Dems were well placed to contest the seat, having held it between 1997 and 2015.\u0026nbspAll the same, a Lib Dem win today will be a small but significant gain for Remainers, and in particular for opponents of a no-deal Brexit, despite the constituency having voted, in line with the nation as a whole,\u0026nbspby 52 per cent to leave the EU in the referendum.brecon and radnorshire by-election\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This meant using WhatsApp on computers would require users to link it to the original device\u0027s account.The new upgrade will mean WhatsApp will work in a similar way to other apps like Facebook, where users can use the same login details across devices, download standalone versions of the app on any and all of their devices and have messages sync between them all.The latest WhatsApp rumour comes courtesy of WaBetaInfo, who claim the new capabilities are currently under development.Created with Sketch.12 useful WhatsApp features you didn’t know existed Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone.

He aims to sell himself as an effective leader who is open to compromise and evidences this with his experience as governorOhio representative Tim Ryan will be running a campaign that hinges on his working class rootsOn Wednesday, Mr Biden was assailed from all sides, sometimes by more than one person at a time. (It probably did not help\u0026nbspthat he started the night by telling Ms Harris: Go easy on me kid!)He was challenged by senator Kirsten Gillibrand over an article he wrote in 1981 suggesting women should not work outside the home. He was questioned by Ms Harris over his support, until recently, for a piece of Republican-created legislation that prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortions.He was attacked too, by Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey who spoke both fluidly and concisely, managed to express genuine warmth, and was generally reckoned to have been among the best of the 10 candidates debating last night.“We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump — but not only Donald Trump, I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump,” Mr Booker said. “Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling.”Biden struggles to explain op-ed saying \u0027women should not be working outside of the home\u0027Mr Biden, who frequently flailed, and repeatedly referred to things he had done as vice president to Barack Obama - a reminder to many that he represented the past but not necessarily the future -\u0026nbspwas not the only one to be challenged on stage.Ms Harris, 53, who had entered the night in fourth place in most polls, was attacked several times over her mixed record as a prosecutor in California, where she has faced criticism for supporting “tough on crime” type policies. While she declined to pursue the death penalty against a man convicted of killing a police officer, for instance, she did defend the state\u0027s death penalty system in court. Her performance on Wednesday was solid, but as with Mr Biden, it paled when compared to the way progressives Bernie Sanders and Ms Warren stole the night just 24 hours earlierAmong the most powerful attacks against her came from congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii.“Senator Harris says she\u0027s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she\u0027ll be a prosecutor president, but I\u0027m deeply concerned about this record,” she said. “There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.”She added: “The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and impact in these people\u0027s lives, you did not.”Among the other candidates, Washington governor Jay Inslee made a passionate case that climate change was the most important challenge facing the\u0026nbspUS, and the world. \u0026nbspBiden struggles to explain saying \u0027women should not work outside home\u0027Joe Biden needs to withdraw- the latest Democratic debate proved thatWho won and who lost the Democratic debate?Democratic debate interrupted by hecklers shouting about immigrationJoe Biden heard on hot mic asking Harris to \u0027go easy\u0027 before debate“We have one last chance. When you have one chance in life, you take it. Think about this. Literally the survival of humanity on this planet in civilization is in the hands of the next president,” said Mr Inslee, one of many of the 20 candidates who appeared over two nights\u0026nbspin Michigan hoping they did enough to qualify for the third debate in Texas.The Democratic National Committee has said it will double the qualification standards for the third debate, an attempt to thin out the crowded field. Mr Biden will certainly be there. But his performance tonight has ensured that\u0026nbsphe will again be the one his rivals will turn on.The great unknowable question is how badly these attacks damage him in the eyes of voters. After the first debate, he saw his lead slip by up to 10 points, but it had almost recovered by the time he travelled to Detroit.\u0026nbspThe challenge for Mr Biden, who did not look happy the entire night, may be less his polling numbers, rather than whether he can persuade major Democratic donors and grassroots activists that he is the man to get behind in 2020. On that question, Mr Biden still has a mountain to climb.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He then disappeared for a while, before coming back to hit\u0026nbspJoe\u0026nbspBiden\u0026nbsprepeatedly over criminal justice reform with some choice language. Booker showed none of the deference you’d expect\u0026nbspfrom a young senator to a veteran\u0026nbsppolitico who served eight years as vice president - at one point dismissing Mr Biden\u0027s phony rhetoric - but that ruthlessness made his performance all the more memorable.This wasn\u0027t in the same ballpark as her\u0026nbspperformance in the first debate, where she confronted Mr\u0026nbspBiden over bussing. But, after a shaky start where she sounded flustered by Mr Biden\u0027s energetic opening, she regained her footing. There was one uncomfortable moment\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspTulsi Gabbard\u0026nbspquestioned\u0026nbspher record as a prosecutor - but she didn\u0027t fold. She\u0027ll mark this debate as a net positive.All polling numbers suggest he\u0027s got zero shot at winning this thing. He\u0027s even widely\u0026nbspdisliked in his own city. But his undisputed strength is in debating. The most striking moment for him came\u0026nbspwhen he\u0026nbspasked Mr Biden whether he tried to slow the number of deportations when he was vice president.You want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions,” de Blasio said to Biden. “I guarantee you, if you’re debating Donald Trump, he’s not going to let you off the hook.After a quiet first half, she managed to hit\u0026nbspMs Harris harder than Mr\u0026nbspBiden did at any point in the evening by pinning her down on her record as California’s attorney general.\u0026nbspIt’s a very fertile line of attack for progressives, though, and Harris knows this. She was prepared, but it was an uncomfortable moment for her.She also used her clout garnered from two tours of duty in the Middle East to good effect, saying: For too long we had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence the toll it takes on our service members.He was hit from every angle and simply didn’t appear to have the agility to deal with it. He started off with spark when challenged on his healthcare plans, but fell back to his typical mumbles and stumbles under pressure later in the debate. While Harris converted jibes from the sidelines into jabs at her main rival, Mr Biden found himself becoming the punching bag of everyone from Mr Booker to Mr de Blasio. He was, on more than one occasion, happy to immediately stop speaking when moderators asked him to finish his answer, which is generally the sign of a politician in trouble.She had one of the more memorable lines of the night (promising to deep clean the Oval Office if she became president), but failed to make a significant overall impact. At one point, she appeared to be so caught off-guard\u0026nbspby being called upon by moderators that there an awkward pause of several seconds as she gathered her thoughts. Unluckily for her, when she was getting into her stride on gender equality, the moderators cut her off.He looked like a deer in the headlights in the first debate, and needed a breakout moment on Wednesday night. Repeatedly banging the drum for his $1,000-a-month guaranteed income plan wasn\u0027t close to enough.Considering he\u0027s a rank outsider in the race, with little name recognition, he got a lot of face-time with the American public. He seemed to chip in on almost every exchange for an extended period of time - with his hand in the air like the earnest know-it-all at the front of the classroom. But none of the interventions felt significant enough to cut through at home.Strong on climate, forgettable on most other topics he chimed in on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Heres the lowdown on the calls for a price hike.The average cost of a pack of cigarettes in the UK soared to over a tenner last year.In the  budget the then Chancellor Philip Hammond whacked on an extra p to a pack of  cigarettes putting the average price at £..That meant a -a-day smoker keeping up their habit saw themselves an extra £. out of pocket over the course of a year.Packets of ten cigarettes have been banned since May .But some campaign groups worry another duty increase will impoverish hard-up smokers and push them towards buying illegal cigarettes.Simon Clark, director of the smokers’ group Forest, told the The Sun: “Tobacco duty has been rising for years as a result of the so-called tobacco tax escalator with the result that over  per cent of the cost of tobacco now goes to government.“A further increase in tobacco duty will once again hit those who can least afford it, the elderly and the low paid.As well as forcing some people further into poverty, it will inevitably encourage others to buy their tobacco abroad or on the black market.Anti-smoking campaigners are calling for the price of fags to by hiked even higher still in a bid to reduce smoking levels.Boffins claim that slapping on an extra tenner to the current price could lead to unprecedented health gains and poverty reduction.The British Medical Journalsaid research indicated a substantial increase in the price of cigarettes would help millions of people around the world avoid poor health and extreme poverty.Prof Prabhat Jha, from the University of Toronto and St Michaels Hospital, claims: Our study debunks the current narrative that higher cigarette prices would negatively impact the poorest among us.This analysis shows the opposite - a higher price would encourage cessation, lead to better health, and save money much more strongly for the poor than the rich.He said his research showed taxing poor people was the best way to get them to quit, especiallyit makes them prohibitively expensive.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to Wired, hed drop acid in the morning before heading off to work.On one harrowing occasion, McAfee snorted an entire bag of a psychedelic powder called DMT. He was found hiding behind a rubbish bin, convinced he could hear voices.Over the next few years, his drug habit escalated, and McAfee found himself doing lines of cocaine at work most days.Unsurprisingly, things eventually came to a head in the early s when his we left him and he was sacked.Contemplating taking his own le like his dad, McAfee finally sought the help he needed to get sober and landed a job as a software engineer for defence contractor Lockheed Martin.While there, he came across the first-known computer virus. He tried to crack it himself - with his success propelling him towards fame and fortune.By , McAfee had established himself as the worlds leading antivirus expert and founded McAfee Associates, with his antivirus product becoming an instant hit. Seven years later, he sold his stake to Intel, netting around £million.With his fortune, McAfee splashed out on properties in Hawaii, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, as well as antique cars and a fleet of planes.In a particularly eccentric move, he also set up a sex yoga ashram school.But after the economic collapse in , bad boy McAfee auctioned off all his belongings, and moved to the Central American jungle, where he bought a villa in picturesque Belize.Desperate to keep old age at bay, the increasingly wacky tycoon would allegedly inject testosterone into his bum every other week.He was also joined in the country by a harem of seven much younger women.“Some people think it is horrendous that I lived with seven women aged between  and ,” McAfee would later tell The Sun. “People can think what they want. The women all got along.He also bizarrely revealed one of his lovers, a teen called Amy, had tried to shoot him.She tried to kill me when we first met, although we got over that, he said.Despite his playboy antics, McAfee never went on porn sites in case he got a virus.I just dont go there, he once told the BBC.During his time in Belize, the businessman started up an antibiotics company and began posting on drug-taking message boards about attempts to pury the compounds within bath salts, Gizmodo reports.However, he began to get paranoid he was being watched, and his business venture turned to ruin when local cops raided his company lab in search of evidence of drug-making.They found a cache of weapons and £, in cash, but no illegal drugs.According to McAfee, the raid marked the beginning of a conspiracy to destroy him - something he believes was revenge for his refusal to be extorted by the Belizean government.He even claimed the authorities were trying to kill him. Belizes Prime Minister Dean Barrow has dismissed McAfees allegations, labelling him “extremely paranoid, even bonkers”, news.au reports.In , McAfee was deemed a person of interest by the nations police - something he remains to be - when his neighbour Gregory Faull was discovered shot dead in a pool of blood.Officers called by McAfees home, but there was no sight of him.The tycoon, who has admitted American Mr Faull was not my favourite person but has denied any involvement in his death, would later claim he buried himself in sand to evade police.He fled Belize, but was arrested in Guatemala in December .He was charged with illegally entering the country, but faked a heart attack to buy some time so his lawyer could stop him being deported back to Belize.The plan seemingly worked - days later, McAfee was sent to the US.Shortly after, McAfee met we Janice, , in Miami Beach, Florida, when he hired her as a prostitute with money loaned to him by a friend, and the pair tied the knot in .But the drama wasnt over yet.The same year, McAfee uploaded a parody video, How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus, showing him criticising McAfee software while snorting powder and surrounded by women.And three years later, he was at the centre of another scandal when the Showtime documentary, Gringo: The dangerous le of John McAfee, was released.It alleged he drugged and raped a former business partner, and committed murder - accusations McAfee has vehemently denied.McAfee was then served with a subpoena by the US Securities and Exchange Commission , reported to be related to his involvement in cyber-currencies. He told Reuters he did not pay income tax for eight years for ideological reasons and was indicted.The following year, McAfee and his we revealed they were living in a Tennessee compound with a   armed bodyguard, claiming they had been followed for the past four years.The same year, McAfee claimed he had been targeted in a poisoning assassination attempt, posting images on Twitter purportedly showing him on le support in hospital.I am more dficult to kill than anyone can possibly imagine, he wrote.Earlier this year, McAfee left his heavily-fortied compound and took off on a yacht to avoid trial, along with Janice, their four large dogs, two security staff and seven staff.The tycoon - who has previously claimed hes fathered  kids - left the States for the Bahamas, then Cuba, after suspecting US law enforcement were trying to extradite him.But last week, the businessman was detained with Janice and his crew in the Dominican Republic - just days after claiming on Twitter that the CIA had tried to collect him.His Twitter feed was taken over by a friend, who warnedJohn misses his next check-in, events will be set into motion - another sign of just how paranoid the tech whizz is.McAfee and his crew were detained for four days, before initially being released on July . But the day after, McAfee claimed to have been arrested for the second time in a week.He shared photos of himself on Twitter, with his arms around his captors - along with the bare-chested image of him in a cell, which Janice deemed her favourite.He claimed he had smuggled a phone into the jail by sleight of hand, adding: If my hands were bigger I could have smuggled a Bangkok prostitute in with me.Soon after, McAfee revealed he and Janice had landed in London, with pictures purportedly showing the pair visiting a restaurant and in a hotel room with some guards.The bad guys never came close, the tycoon tweeted.Now, McAfee has fled once more, to the secret, fortied facility in Lithuania - after claiming the long arm of the US was trying to get him in Britain.And while its unclear exactly where this facility is, one thing is for certain - McAfee will never stop looking over his shoulder for the next attacker.There is an underground network of corrupt national officials that is used by the CIA for nefarious purposes, he claims.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist. But it was not him alone who deserves to take the rap.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From then on the doctor had to come out every day.I had to hold her down while he changed her dressings. It was heartbreaking to see her in so much pain.The mum, a nail technician from West Lothian, said her daughter would try to run away every time she saw the doctor arrive as it hurt so much to change the bandages.She added: She was in such agony that we couldn’t go anywhere with her – she couldn’t walk normally without her legs rubbing together and it hurt for her to even sit down.Sarah said it took about four months for Esmes wounds to heal after the October holiday last year, with the youngster left with scars.And she said her little girl was even too scared to go swimming again.Sarah explained: She doesn’t want to go swimming. She was really good before we went and had just started to swim without her armbands on, but now she panics and asksshe’ll get burnt again.It is believed Esmes injuries were caused by a chemical imbalance at the resorts pool.She said: As soon as you get on holiday, the first thing kids want to do is go for a swim.

Thankfully Esme has made a good recovery but it could easily have been far worse.James Villa Holidays said it was unable to comment due to it being an ongoing legal case.But a spokesman added: However, we take the welfare of all our customers extremely seriously and all our pools are subject to laws and regulations set out by the countries in which we operate.”"},{"url":null,"title":"faulty wave machine creates massive tsunami injuring 44 swimmers chinese waterpark","story":"Tourists can be heard screaming in video footage as the mountain of water launches over the barrier, forcing people to swim for their lives.The incident occurred at the hugely popular summer tourist resort known as the Shuiyun Water Park on July .The large wave pool is part of the Yulong Bay Scenic Area in Jilin Province, north-eastern China.Footage taken by visitors shows swimmers inside the wave pool suddenly faced with the large wave produced by the wave machine.Described as a tsunami, the huge wave can be seen sweeping away tourists, flipping many of them and their swimming flotation rings upside-down in the chaos.The video shows visitors, who were standing outside the wave pool, running for their lives as they realise the unusually large wave is going to splash over the barrier.Among the dozens injured was a woman, shown in the clip, sprawled on the ground and bleeding from her legs.A spokesman for the water park told local media that the freak wave, was caused by a mechanical fault.The wave pool was closed for a day for repairs.

You know, when you just survive.”Simon Greave, Labour leader in Bassetlaw, Notts, one of the communities the report focused on, said people were fed up and beyond frustrated with Westminsters dilly-dallying over Brexit.He said people in his town wanted the whistle blown on game-playing with Brussels so Britains big domestic issues could be tackled.He told The Sun: People knew what they were voting for.The fact that some decision-makers don’t want to listen is a Westminster problem, not one created by local people in Worksop.The fact is that in Worksopcrime is lower, deprivation is lower and unemployment is lower.Comparisons like this mean nothing though when you’re working all hours to make ends meet, without access to affordable childcare and support for your family.People don’t want hand outs, we want the opportunities we are entitled to, with the chance of better paid more secure jobs for themselves and their children.”Both the Tories and Labour have highlighted that small towns will be the battleground for the next election.Boris promised a substantial cash splurge and Labour hired an award-winning director to make a three-minute film to show its commitment to small towns last year.Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, is delighted Boris has put towns and cities at the heart of his Government already.He told The Sun: I’ve been really pleased that Boris has put the regions and post industrial towns like Mansfield at the centre of his policy agenda.But many in small towns feel left behind and “disillusioned” with the Westminster machine.They feel like politicians don’t care about areas outside of London and communities that once thrived have been left to fend for themselves.One man, from Newport, South Wales, said: Westminster and the government are London-centric, and the further west, east, north you go, you know, the poorer things are.Towns close to Britains biggest cities were losing out twice, according to the JRF, as they fight both London and their nearest neighbour for investment and funding.A woman from Bolton, a town  miles from Manchester, which voted  per cent to Leave, said: I think what we could call traditional working class areas, theyre declined to the benefit of richer areas where people want to invest money - rather than actually investing it areas where it would make a dference to local le.Another woman from Middlesbrough, a city where  per cent voted Leave, said: “We’ve been sort of left in this area.”While big businesses flock to Britain’s cities like London, Manchester and Birmingham – small cities and towns are left to pick off the scraps.“It’s all low paid jobs, so to be able to bring up the area in general, we need people with higher paid jobs, she said.“They need to be more companies to be brought in that aren’t just distribution centres so we need incentives.”Boris has promised to inject cash for improved transport, housing and leisure facilities to reverse decades of decline and neglect in Britain’s towns.Up to  forgotten towns will get a share of the fund under a drive to unite and “level up” the country.He vowed to create a new “golden age” for Britain and declared: “We’re going to put proper money into places that need it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a drumstick up a politics","story":"NewsA drumstick up the a*** of politics -

Like every valiant hero he won his spurs in the heat of battle. It was the  General Election when the Mirror sent out a headless chicken to sort out a Tory rival who had been teasing Tony Blair for not appearing in a TV debate.A Conservative press officer took offence at our Caponed Crusader, and tried to wrestle him to the ground, only to receive, like John Major on election night, a good smack in the ballots. When footage of the fight made the TV news bulletins, a star was hatched.    For the next  years The Daily Mirror Chicken would rule the Westminster roost, flapping into action against political bottlers with this famous battle-cry: “Though cowards flinch and Tories sneer, we’ll keep the Red Fowl squawking here.” Strutting around his London Dockside coop he has finally decided to speak out about his remarkable encounters. I ask him to sum up his time in public le. “Basically I think I’ve been a force for good. I turned John Major even greyer, made Nick Clegg, or as I call him Foghorn Cleghorn, hide in school toilets over tuition fees, crapped over Ken Clarke’s suede shoes and followed the Chancellor George Osborne all the way to Klosters, in Switzerland.    “As John Prescott, said to me ‘you’re a right drumstick up the arse, you are.’” His favourite confrontation was with David Cameron, who, after avoiding him for weeks on the  election trail, finally agreed to a ham-fisted beak-to-beak meeting. “I went for the smooth-talk, at first, telling him we had something in common. That we both think it’s good sport for all foxes to be ripped from limb to limb, and over the next few weeks his fate was destined to be the same as mine. “That was when he began to grab my neck, until one of his spin doctors told him that being spotted choking the chicken in public wouldn’t play too well with the marginal voters.”  Lately he’s enjoyed getting back into action with the Tory leadership contest. “It was a complete yolk but it’s work so I can’t complain. What a shower they were though. Gove’s face reminds me of my father’s. When he was getting plucked. The good news for me is that lying plucker Johnson won, because as he’s the biggest Tory chicken of them all, there’s now more Westminster interest in me than the Downing Street cat.” An interest which has turned up the fact that one of the Mirror Chicken’s assistants from nine years ago, Lee Cain, has become Johnson’s chief spin doctor. How did he take the news   “I always had my suspicions he was a Tory – more foul than fowl. On the plus side I’d like to think he learned all his spin doctor skills from me. After all it’s a small step from talking chicken to spouting bull. “In fact I’m thinking of taking a leaf out of his boss’s book and giving his address to the local cock of the walk.” Isn’t that a bit over-the-top, I ask, but he shakes his beak, and says ominously: “In my world there’s nothing more egg-regious than a poacher, or even a scrambler, turning gamekeeper.” I askhe prefers the old school politicians to today’s and he shakes his wattles in agreement. “It was much better a few years ago when they weren’t scared of tough interviews on Newsnight. I could identy with that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit spending officially","story":"NewsNo Deal Brexit spending officially tops £bn as Boris Johnson confirms huge new fundThe Government has announced they are spending another £.billion in case of no dealShareByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPlans to prevent chaosBoris Johnson leaves the EU without a deal on Halloween will cost another £.billion, the Chancellor announced. The new figure includes plans to stop the UK running out of food and medicine. It is by far the largest spending commitment made since Mr Johnson came to power, bringing government spending on Brexit preparations to £.billion. Labour ’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded it an “appalling waste of tax-payers’ cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson ’s drive towards a totally avoidable No Deal.” He added: “This government could have ruled out No Deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people.    And GMB boss Tim Roache said : “It’s needless, and it’s based on Tory Party isions not the needs of working people. “ The Treasury has earmarked £ million to spend preparing the UK Border for the chaos of a no-deal Brexit, including  extra Border Force officials. And cash will be spent improving transport infrastructure around the Kent coast to deal with massive tailbacks at Dover. The Government will spend a further £ million to ensure the supply of vital medicinestrade routes break down. And more than £ million will be spent on an ad campaign to encourage Brits to prepare for the worst-case Brexit scenario. Some £. billion of the cash will be available immediately - with a further £ billion available for Government departments to bid on as necessary.    Number  insiders now believe leaving without a deal is the most likely outcome, despite Boris Johnson saying publicly it was a “million to one” just days ago. Mr Javid said: “With  days until the UK leaves the European Union it’s vital that we intensy our planning to ensure we are ready. “We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. Butwe can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one. This additional £. billion will ensure we are ready to leave on  October - deal or no deal.” Best for Britain CEO Naomi Smith said: “This is a colossal waste of money for something both Parliament and the country don’t want. “We know a no-deal Brexit will mean shortages of foods and medicines, and we know it’ll cost the country a fortune. Now the new Chancellor wants to throw billions more at the problem his government is responsible for creating. “Wasting money like this when we have so many other priorities is exactly why the country has turned against Brexit. We need to stop fixating on it so that we can fix the country.”  GMB General Secretary Tim Roache warned Brexit will make things far worse for working people unless Boris Johnson stops fixating on our departure from the EU and tackles their “real le” concerns. Writing for the Mirror, he said: “If politicians do not address the everyday worries of large swathes of the public – orthe outcome of Brexit is to makes things far worse and not better for working people then that lead to a want to tear down the status quo.” “The last PM didn’t learn that lesson,” Mr Roache added. “And the current one couldn’t figure it outit smacked him over the head.” It comes after Boris Johnson reaffirmed his commitment to leaving the EU on October  “come what may” during a meeting with political leaders in Northern Ireland. A Number  spokesman said: “He said that in all scenarios, the government is steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement and that in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border.” The Prime Minister faced a third day of jeers and protests as his tour of the UK’s regions landed in Stormont for talks aimed at restoring power sharing.    The PM promised to be “impartial” in the talks, despite enjoying a cosy dinner with leaders of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Partythe night before. On Tuesday night, the Prime Minister dined with DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds, to discuss renewing the grubby pact Theresa May hatched with their party to prop up her fragile grip on Parliament.    Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance, all supporters of Theresa May’s ill-fated Withdrawal Agreement and the contentious border backstop, warned Mr Johnson of the potentially damaging consequences for the regionthe UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Ulster Unionists, which campaigned for Remain in  but now want to see Brexit delivered, also cautioned the Prime Minister against a no-deal. The DUP again insisted they wanted to see a “sensible” Brexit deal, but said it would be foolish to take no-deal off the negotiating table.

Ellis Tankard, , has had chronic constipation since he was just one year old.The condition made him unable to go to the bathroom without medical intervention, and he had to be regularly rushed to hospital to empty his bowls, HullLive reported.His debilitating condition became so bad that at one point he even vomited up his own faeces. After this happened doctors decided to surgically intervene, and Ellisapos le changed forever.  Ever since he was little, we were rushing Ellis in and out of hospital for treatment because he struggled to go to the toilet, said Ellisapos mum, Liz Sewell. He couldnapost do anything and used to be crouching down all the time because he had the urge to poo but couldnapost go. He could hardly walk because his bum was blistered and bleeding from straining, which also put him off doing any activities due to the pain. Ellisapos illness got that bad that he was throwing up his own poo because he couldnapost manage to go to the toilet, and after that happened, consultants decided the medication that he was swallowing down to help him go was just not working. That was when surgeons decided to intervene, installing a button that would allow Elias to go to the bathroom.    When he was four years old he had surgery to fit him with a mic-key button that means he gets medication fed in to his tummy through the button, which leads directly to his stomach to allow him to go,apos his mum said. Heaposs also had two operations including having his appendix moved since, but his bowel just doesnapost seem to want to work. Ellisapos condition is called chronic constipation but it is not known how it can be cured. Doctors hope that in time Ellisapos bowel will recty itself and start working normally but they do not know whether this will happen. If his condition does not naturally recty itself or worsen, Ellis will have to be fitted with a stoma bag as an adult. But mum-of-three Miss Sewell, , says that the mic-key button has given her son a new lease of le, with Ellis not letting his illness hold him back. Ellisapos quality of le has been improved so much after his mic-key button was fitted and he can now go swimming, play rugby, go on a bouncy castle and just do the same activities as any other child, she said. Heaposs taken it all in his stride and has been so brave with everything thataposs happened to him, and is a caring, loving boy that would do anything for anyone. Heaposs been through so much for a child of his age with all the operations, hospital admissions and blood tests heaposs had, as well as taking medication every day and needing his button changing every five or six months.

Pregnant Leanne Whelan swung a hammer at Peter Taylor before proceeding to call him, queer and a f****t along with her sisters Louise and Samantha Whelan in Birkenhead, Liverpool, on August  of last year. Children playing in the street witnessed Leanne, , Louise, , and Samantha, , shouting and screaming at their victim, the Liverpool Echo reports. However, the three single mums walked free from Liverpool Crown Court after the judge ruled that their imprisonment would cause signicant harm to their children. Prosecutors said there was a dispute between the sisters and the paternal gran of Samanthaaposs children, Deborah McKenna, over a dog. They said Ms McKenna and her son Thomas Carson had made reports to social services about the welfare of children, but no action was taken.    Paul Becker, prosecuting, said it later involved Katie Cunningham, the girlfriend of Mr Carson, and Mr Taylor, a friend of the McKenna family. He said all parties on both sides of the dispute were warned by a housing association about their behaviour before the incident, on August  last year. The Whelan sisters said they were driving to their mumaposs when they saw Ms Cunningham outside Mr Carsonaposs house in Alwen Street, Birkenhead. Prosecutors accepted it was a chance encounter but they got out of a silver Mercedes and shouted come on letaposs go before Leanne got a hammer. Ms Cunningham fled into the house but Mr Taylor, who was in the back garden and heard shouting, came out to investigate. Mr Becker said the sisters shouted to Ms Cunningham and Ms McKenna to come out, but Mr Taylor told them to calm down. He said: Samantha Whelan was abusive and said aposf*** off, we donapost want you. Mr Becker said Mr Taylor stood his ground and Leanne swung the hammer, missing his upper body, during chaotic scenes. He said: Leanne Whelan was seen to be bouncing towards Mr Taylor, threatening and generally acting aggressively. Mr Taylor was shocked and scared. Mr Becker said the victim backed off and the sisters walked away but were all shouting homophobic comments about Mr Taylor    He said they also made threats to Ms Cunningham, screaming youaposre getting this over your head. Mr Taylor said he was left feeling depressed and anxious, looking over his shoulder all the time and struggling to sleep at night. The Whelan sisters said the victims were lying and claimed to have alibis, before admitting threatening behaviour ahead of a trial. Leanne, of Treetops Drive, Bidston, who has five previous convictions for  offences, also admitted possessing an offensive weapon. Her criminal record includes assaulting a police officer, common assault and assault causing actual bodily harm. Andrew McInnes, defending Leanne, said an allegation was made that Ms Cunningham assaulted one of the sisters the previous day. He said remorseful and embarrassed Leanne was a good mother to her children, aged seven months, three and . Mr McInnes said both Leanne and her two eldest children had dficulties, but she had since avoided the victims and planned to leave Birkenhead. Louise, of Wakefield Drive, Leasowe, has  previous convictions for  offences, including racially aggravated harassment against a supermarket security guard.    Anna Duke, defending Louise, said her client had two daughters, aged seven and nine, who suffered from ADHD and dyspraxia. She said a medical report found Louise could be very impulsive and lacked thinking skills, but she had signed up for counselling. Samantha, of Tollemache Road, Oxton, has three previous convictions for assaulting a police officer, battery and shoplting. Bernice Campbell, defending Samantha, said she had a daughter, , and son, aged four, who was awaiting an assessment for autism. She said: Samantha Whelan has been a victim herself, calling the police after she got beat up in front of her four-year-old child. Judge Gary Woodhall said Mr Taylor was subjected to homophobic abuse and the sistersapos emotions got out of control. He said: It appears the background to this offence was either a falling out over a dog or allegations of sexual impropriety and the like. Whatever it was, it led to a dispute between extended family members and tensions increasing up to the day of this offence. Clearly issues were ongoing for some time. Various complaints were made to social services including about the welfare of children. All parties involved - both sides - were warned about their behaviour by a housing association. Various allegations made to police were not prosecuted. Whatever the rights and wrongs of this dispute, itaposs clear to me by August  last year, you three resented the way things had not been investigated or not prosecuted, you three resented the way the witnesses in this case behaved, and you were angry and upset.

However, locals now claim residents are now even letting out their balconies for desperate tourists. They claim that bargain balcony beds can be found on hoe rental site Airbnb. Campaign groups including Prou! , the union of tenants of Ibiza and Formentera, and the organisation Eivissa Desperta sent a letter to the city council of Ibiza complaining that balconies were being rented out on the site. In one photo shared by the campaign groups at least three mattresses can be seen on balconies at the back of a residential building on Cataluna Street in Ibiza. According to local media outlet Diario de Ibiza, the organisations reported that one of the flats is decorated like a hotel and is changing tenants every few days. Prou! told local media: “If a large number of residents face this abusive situation, there will be a chance to solve the destruction we are going through”. Renting the balconies is seen as a way of combating the lack of available space in Ibiza during the high season with couples sometimes subletting their flats without the landlordsapos knowledge.

The installation was created to highlight the fact that , tonnes of portable cells end up in UK landfill sites every year. To raise awareness of the issue, Duracell - which recycled  tonnes this year - launched a apos Big Battery Hunt apos and recruited .million schoolkids to hand batteries in . A small number of these were used to create the ft-tall sculpture, which weighs two tonnes.    It is intended to be a visual celebration of the environmental efforts of the primary school children who were involved in the campaign. And with batteries being dubbed the aposelephant in roomapos of the recycling debate, it is hoped the creation will inspire a whole new generation of battery recyclers. The elephant will be on show at Hanwell Zoo in West London for the duration of the summer holidays. Duracell hopes the saying aposan elephant never forgetsapos will inspire all of us not to forget Generation Zaposs power to make mammoth change. Tony Diaz, an artist and sculptor at Big Stuff Design which created it, said: Itaposs taken  hours and in excess of , recycled batteries but every moment has been worth it.    Creating this elephant has been a humbling reminder that powering change can come from anywhere. It is so inspiring to see the younger generation actively involved in making the world a better place and teaching their own parents and loved ones about the importance of recycling. This year the Big Battery Hunt challenged . million children from , schools around the country to pick up a Big Battery Hunt collection box and hunt for used batteries in their communities. Beau-Jensen McCubbin, a spokesman for Hanwell Zoo said, We are very proud to be the home of the Big Battery Hunt elephant and are very keen to continue to encourage our visitors to reduce landfill waste.  Our environment is so fragile, and now more than ever we all need to be doing our bit to protect our planet and the incredible bioersity that calls it home. We all have a responsibility to be more sustainable and we are calling on all of our visitors to make a dference by bringing their used batteries along with them on their visit to Hanwell Zoo. We have bins in place to collect all the used batteries you can find. Christina Turner, associate marketing director at Duracell said: Generation Z are increasingly making their voices on sustainability heard.  By reflecting the provocative tone of the young activist movement and shining a spotlight on these young change makers, the Big Battery Hunt aims to inspire long-term, positive recycling behaviours. We have been so impressed with the efforts of the . million students involved in the Big Battery Hunt this year and our recycled battery elephant is a true celebration of all those involved. The participation this year has been overwhelming, with over % of all primary schools in the UK getting involved. Thataposs a lot of children driving change. But you do not have to be of primary school age to be a battery recycler, it is a lot easier than people realise. You can even do it at your local grocery store.

In another photo she pats her stomach while sat at a table as they discuss ideas. In a third snap she is also seen surveying a rack of clothes. The discreet trips were arranged months before she gave birth to son Archie in May. The -year-old, who will celebrate her birthday on Sunday, was moved by the impactful work being done by the non profit organisation, Smart Works, which helps women into the workforce.    It equips them with both the skills and clothes they need to feel job-ready, but Meghan noticed that the donations were a combination of mismatched items and colours. The style-conscious duchess felt the clothes didn’t necessarily “suit” the job at hand: to make a woman feel confident and inspired as she walked into her job interview. So this autumn, Meghan will be supporting a collection to help equip the women of Smart Works with the key workwear essentials they need as they enter into the workplace.  She has teamed up with leading British retailers to create a capsule collection of womenaposs clothing. Meghan asked John Lewis, Marks  Spencer, Jigsaw and her fashion designer pal Misha Nonoo to create a fashion line which will benefit her patronage.Writing in the September issue of Vogue, which she guest edited, the new mum explained: When you walk into a Smart Works space you’re met with racks of clothing and an array of bags and shoes.Sometimes, however, it can be a potpourri of mismatched sizes and colours, not always the right stylistic choices or range of sizes.  To help with this, I asked Marks  Spencer, John Lewis  Partners, Jigsaw and my friend, the designer Misha Nonoo,they were willing to design a capsule collection of more classic options for a workwear wardrobe. Taking the idea further, many of the brands agreed to use the one-for-one model: for each item purchased by a customer, one is donated to the charity. Not only does this allow us to be part of each other’s story, it reminds us we are in it together. A spokesman for the Duchess added: This initiative is supported by four generous brands who share the vision to empower the women of Smart Works to look and feel as they bravely venture in to what can often be a daunting environment for those who have been out of the job market.  "},{"url":null,"title":"new hi tech electric contact","story":"NewsNew hi-tech electric contact lenses allow eyes to zoom in and out on objectsNew prototype contact lens tracks your eye movements, and focuses appropriately using electrical impulsesShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science Correspondent:,  AUG NewsSci-fi lenses are becoming a reality by mimicking the natural electric signals that occur in the human eyeball \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRobotic contact lenses that can zoom in and out with a simple blink of the eye have been created by scientisits. The electric lenses can automatically switch between focusing on near or far away objects by tracking the wearer’s eye movements. The sci-fi lenses are becoming a reality by mimicking the natural electric signals that occur in the human eyeball. The breakthrough came by identying an electric field around the human eye and dferences in electrical voltage between the front and the back of the eye.    US researchers at Calornia University realised that when a person moves their eyes to look around or blink, that electrical signal can be measured and tracked by the lenses. Made from stretchy polymer films encasing salt water, they change their structure when an electrical current is applied to them. Switching between long and short viewing is done by doing a double blink. Lead researcher Shengqiang Cai said: “Evenyour eye cannot see anything, many people can still move their eyeball and generate this electrooculographic signal.” There are thought to be more than four million people in Britain who now wear contact lenses and rates are increasing. Researchers believe it could help people who are both long and short sighted.

She was earning £. an hour as a Co-op shop assistant in her home town of ­Workington, Cumbria.  Callie, whose dad Jeff, , recently died of cancer, said: “I did not want that much money. I was in foster care and for the first time in a long time, I was really settled and really happy. When they told me it was a £million jackpot, I thought, ‘I don’t want that much.’ In the end it was shared out and I got £.million, but even then it was hard to take in. “At  you do not know what is ahead of you, because by God I did not expect any of that. I asked the Co-opI could have my old job back.” But Callie moved out and bought her first house at  with then boyfriend Nicky Lawson, the dad of her eldest ­children Kian, , and -year-old Debony. Callie, who also had a son, Blake, seven, and daughter Georgia, three, with fireman Paul Penny, splashed the cash on holidays, cars and presents.    She added: “I would give money to distant relatives and friends of friends. I loaned £, here, £, there. I would never get it back. “People asked for money for new cars and I would help out. I was a soft touch. Now I realise what they were like. I was exploited because of my age. I had a lot of fake relationships.” At age  things took a sinister twist after she and Nicky had a dficult time. Callie tried to kill herself and her children were taken from her. She spent £, on boob jobs to boost her self confidence. But Callie denies she spent £, on cocaine. She said: “Put simply, someone  was going to sell a story on me. “It was put to me that I might as well talk about it. So many people made money from selling fake stories. So I agreed to talk. I know that I was far from perfect. I did what ­teenagers do and I went out and had parties. “But I have never ever been a druggie or blown a load of money on cocaine.” Callie advises any young winners to keep their fortune secret.

Poynton in Cheshire was amongst the worst hit places with the fire service declaring a major incident and rescuing  people. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Servicesaid firefighters, emergency services personnel and staff from Highways England were helping those affected, with a rest centre established at the local civic hall. Rescuers have been working through the night to help people in the worst flood-hit areas. It follows a day of flood chaos across the country with bridges destroyed and roads turned into impassable rivers. In Poynton, police urged people not to ignore road closed signs by driving or walking through water. Have you been affected by the floods  Email webnews@mirror    Poynton Fire Station said its crews had been to more than  incidents, including rescuing at least  people from flood water in the area over a four-hour stretch. Police in nearby Wilmslow also said its officers were dealing with flooding and had evacuated affected residents, with Oakenclough Childrenaposs Centre open as a rest centre. The Environment Agency put out multiple flood warnings and alerts covering central, north-west and north-east England on Wednesday.  On Thursday, Northern rail said flooding had disrupted all lines of the railway between Manchester Airport and Wilmslow. Yesterday, the Army was called in to help in North Yorkshire, where a bridge on Grinton Moor, which featured in the opening stage of the  Tour de France, was wrecked. Soldiers from  Yorks laid sandbags for residents in the village of Grinton, where .in of rain had fallen in just two hours. The Yorkshire Dales, the Midlands and Lancashire were among the worst affected areas, but flood warnings were out for Cheshire, Derbyshire, Notts, Co Durham and Scotland last night. In North Yorks, landlady Rowena Hutchinson, , said rain came in “like a waterfall”, at the Red Lion Inn in Langthwaite, Richmond, leaving her up to her chin in water.    She said: “The water just rushed in from the back. It rushed through, and slammed the front door shut and then it rose up to about ft. “I slipped and went under up to my chin, and then managed to grab hold of a bench and pull myself out, but the force of water and speed was just unbelievable.” She managed to get upstairs and called for help from a window. A fireman later carried her out on his back. The pub, in her family for  years, is unlikely to reopen until after Christmas.  Rowena said: “It’s completely smashed, doors off, and a wall has gone. The speed and force of the water was unbelievable.” Major routes were turned “into rivers” and left impassable in what police described as “shocking” travel conditions. It was the picturesque towns and villages of the Yorkshire Dales which were worst hit. Steve Clough, of Swaledale Mountain Rescue, said: “The roads were a raging torrent and there were sheds and household oil tanks floating down them.    “Some homes had a metre of water in them – it was horric.” His team spent more than eight hours searching properties, rescuing about  people. Firemen went to  flooded homes in the area. The fire station in Leyburn, North Yorks, even flooded while its crews answered emergencies. The Brymor Ice Cream parlour, near Masham, North Yorks, was caught in a freak hailstorm. A spokesman said: “Our parlour suffered damage to the roof, power failures and some visitors suffered minor injuries.” Gareth Walls, from nearby Ripon, tweeted that the hailstones had been “like pickled onions”.  The Ard Rock mountain biking festival, planned for Swaledale this weekend, has been cancelled after the rain left the site devastated. Organiser Alex Rafferty, , said: “The rain just came down off the hills in waterfalls, it blew the riverbanks and has damaged a huge amount of infrastructure, local houses and local businesses.” The storms, which brought , lightning strikes in a day, caused chaos, with parts of a railway line between Kirkby Stephen and Garsdale in Cumbria washed away. Train passengers faced delays after a landslip between Carlisle and Skipton. Customers at Tenpin Bowling in Dudley, West Mids, were evacuated as flooding hit the Black Country.

Gina Arnold spent three days in a coma and three months in intensive care undergoing  surgeries after the ordeal, which she has no recollection of. The -year-old, from Michigan, US, had been driving when she lost control of her car causing the vehicle to flip seven times before hitting a tree. She says the force of her seat belt pulling her back left her with a torn abdominal wall as well as two collapsed lungs. They described my abdominal wall being cut like a sword by the seat belt, said Gina.  Even though it did save my le, it caused many le threatening injuries and tore my whole abdominal wall right in half. There hasn’t been a case like that they knew of in America - without a complete abdominal wall. Even though it was a whole abdominal wall tear there is no specic name for it so I am under the traumatic hernia category because it basically is one giant hernia. Despite being stabilised, Ginaaposs parents were warned by doctors that her future was unclear. Gina added: I don’t remember what happened, I just know people told me it was raining - I lost control and over corrected. The person behind me said my car flipped seven times and hit a tree. I remember nothing of that day and ended up in a coma for three days. Both lungs collapsed and my whole body was so swollen they couldn’t see for weeks what kind of broken bones I had.  I had multiple emergency surgeries to stabilise me - they had to remove part of my small intestine and part of my ileum. Gina went on to be in Beaumont Hospital for three months where she spent most of her time in the intensive care unit and endured  abdominal surgeries. The student and respite worker said: The pain was the worst pain I have ever felt - I basically had to learn to walk again which wasn’t guaranteed in the recovery. They even told me I might never leave a hospital setting or live a good quality of le. In an attempt to repair Ginaaposs abdominal wall, surgeons tried loosening the broken muscle to relax with Botox but that failed multiple times. When she eventually left hospital, Ginaaposs stomach ended up swelling three times its size as she had no structure to her intestines. She said: When I got out of the hospital I was nowhere near close to recovery and I had no abdominal wall, no mesh, no nothing.    My stomach grew three times its size because I had no structure so my intestines - in any normal person they would be tightly coiled but now it had the ability to uncoil in my stomach. If I was to get hit in the stomach, it would put me out for days so doctors put me on bed rest until they thought of a surgical plan. As well as the damage to my abdomen, I had tons of bruises, a broken shoulder and clavicle. I also had a broken piece of bone in my leg and a huge cut that opened up my whole bottom left foot - I couldn’t even put pressure on it for almost a year. Luckily I had no brain damage, just a major concussion. It was  months on from the accident - which happened in October  - that surgeons finally decided on what procedure Gina needed and underwent the eight hour surgery to help keep her abdominal wall in place. She said: It was an extremely risky surgery and the first time my surgeon did something like this. They basically took a huge piece of mesh and wrapped it around my stomach - they then attached it to each strip of muscle, my pelvic bone and the top of dead muscle on the top of my sternum area.

Laree Clarke immediately turned to social media and pleaded for help on how to remove the creepy arachnid without disturbing it. She posted a picture of the spider to Facebook and included the caption: Is there anyone that could remove this from my house   I don’t have a container that big! Laree, from Townsville, Australia, added: When I went near it with the phone light it came at me raising it fangs and legs. Hell nahhhh!  Social media users expressed their horror at the sighting. One person said: Itaposs probably easier to burn your house down at this point. Kill it with fire, another added. Another jokingly said the spider was so large that Laree could make it pay rent. Huntsman spiders  - which live all around the world - are known for their enormous size and can grow to a leg span size of  to  inches.  They often venture into Australian homes in a bid to find prey to eat. The large and hairy huntsman spiders are, despite their appearance, not considered dangerous. They are venomous and can cause pain with their bites, but experts say they are reluctant to attack and would rather scamper away when feeling threatened.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1dba5e6501d1.45553844.jpg ","title":"a look at dundee uniteds options for championship opener this weekend","story":"Being a manager who prepares meticulously for every game, it’s a safe bet Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson already knows his starting line-up for Saturday’s Championship opener against Inverness Caley Thistle.Of course, we won’t know what his thoughts on that are until an hour before kick-off at Tannadice.And while Arabs who’ve been following the team closely since the start of pre-season will have a fair idea of most of the names on the team sheet, there are two or three areas the manager will have had to give a lot of thought to.Although United’s spending power means Neilson has cover for every position the friendlies and Betfred Cup games over the past few weeks have given a pretty clear indication of what he regards as he strongest side – almost.Starting from the back, that Benjamin Siegrist will be in goal against ICT is a given.In one Betfred outing and a couple of friendlies, the ing Deniz Mehmet has shown himself to be a more-than-able deputy andSiegrist was to suffer a loss of form or injury, there would be no worries about him stepping up.Siegrist’s form toward the end of last season and in his games so far, though, mean he is a certainty to start the league campaign as No  – and rightly so.Likewise at right-back, summer signing Liam Smith is nailed on to make his Championship debut in this one. The manager fought hard to get him and,Ayr United had been willing to do business, would have signed him in January.Smith fits the attacking profile Neilson wants of his full-backs and has done enough in his early games to suggest he’ll be both a regular starter and an important player in the months to come.Next to him, the names of skipper Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly could be written in indelible ink on the team lines.They’ve been the first choice partnership in the middle of the defence since the beginning of February and, so long as they are fit and available, that will continue to be the case this term.The first big question regarding Saturday comes at left-back. Argentine Adrian Sporle was brought in to play there but his outings so far have shown he’ll need time to adjust to Scottish football.That and the form of Jamie Robson suggests the Scot could get the nod, at least for the early weeks of the season.In midfield, Paul McMullan will surely start wide on the right and,he needs to sharpen up on his delivery, his direct running and ability to go past defenders makes him another key man.In the middle Calum Butcher’s strength and experience means he’s sure of his place and beside him will be Sam Stanton or Ian Harkes, both of whom the manager knows he can rely on.Right now the front places, whether it’s as two out-and-out strikers or one up top and the other slightly withdrawn, are also easy to predict.That will go to Nicky Clark and marquee signing Lawrence Shankland. Clark’s habit of getting important goals makes him valuable and Shankland has done enough in his short time at the club to show he can be the main supply of goals this season.With Peter Pawlett and Osman Sow both nearing fitness again, the attacking options should increase in the next couple of weeks or so and, once that’s the case, the manager’s job in selecting a team will be more dficult.He also knows he can now call on the young trio of Louis Appere, Scott Banks and Logan Chalmers.They’ve all shown they are ready to play a part at first-team level but, right now, there is no need to throw them in."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-nightlife-entertainment-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-big-nights-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"city-s-first-female-lord-provost-tea-tycoon-greatest-glaswegians","story":"WHO do you think is the greatest Glaswegian of all time  This summer we are showcasing the top  men and woman who have put the city on the map.

community","story":"Work has started on the first of a series of colourful murals as part of a bid to brighten up an Aberdeen community.The four artworks are being painted on walls across Torry as part of a mental health project and efforts to improve the perception of the historic fishing community.They will also form part of a mental health art walk to be held in the autumn, with all the artists telling the stories behind their respective visions.The VictoriArt Road arts group is behind the scheme and efforts to brighten up a wall have begun.City artist Katie Guthrie is currently painting on a blank wall at Nigg Bay golf club on St Fittick’s Road.It is one of four artworks planned and it will show the community’s relationship with its surrounding environment.The other artworks planned are a yarn-based mural at Victoria Carpets, an abstract scene at the Marine Scotland lab building and a mural on a wall opposite Tullos Primary School, all due to appear in the coming weeks. vw, px\"  Steven Bedford, from VictoriArt Road, hopes the mural project will change the perception of Torry.He said: “We hope these artworks will improve local residents and the city-wide impression of Torry.“We want to spark people’s curiosity and inspire them to get more involved in art and in their community too.“We hold a meeting every month on how to push the project forward and we would love itmore people would come along and share their ideas or want to get involved in creative practices.”Steven said they have run into an issue at the golf club with the wall there requiring more paint than expected.He said: “The mural located at the Nigg Bay Golf club is still unfinished due to the wall sucking up paint more than expected.“Katie has ordered more and hopes to finish it soon.“There are another three artists who will soon create artworks – Frieda Strachan will be creating a yarn-based mural at the carpet shop on Victoria Road, Isla Valentine will be painting an abstract scene on the Marine Lab and a street artist named Fit Like will be working with Tullos Primary School to create a mural on the wall opposite the school.”The murals will be used as part of a mental health walk planned for September .It will give artists the chance to explain the inspiration behind their work.Workshops and talks from each of the artists involved will give an insight into the process of creating the murals and the inspiration behind them.The VictoriArt Road group were inspired by Aberdeen’s annual Nuart festival and secured a £, grant from the Health Improvement Fund to allow the project to go ahead.The organisation applied to the city council for permission for the murals and it was granted last month.A report submitted alongside the application set out the group’s vision for artworks around Torry.The document said: “We are a collective of residents, artists, activists and community workers.“Our ethos is that creativity is fundamental to the human experience, that beauty is a basic need and that public art improves lives and contributes to social justice.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cc7f4f640d067.84109789-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"coastguard

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at lithicsresearch@btinternetPIC:An artists rendering of Argyll#s ancestors making tools. no_aargyllarcheology"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"35-year-old-admits-cloven-wedding-disturbance","story":"A GALASHIELS man has admitted making abusive comments towards wedding guests at a local hotel.Andrew OConnor also shouted and swore as well as struggled with police officers during the incident at the Clovenfords Hotel on April .The -year-old of Church Place, Galashiels, pleaded guilty at Selkirk Sherf Court to a charge of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner.Sherf Raymond McMenamin described the charge as \"concerning\" and deferred sentence until August  for the production of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report and a Restriction of Liberty Order assessment."},{"url":null,"title":"live-borders-announces-scheme-improve-free-access-fitness","story":"NEW leisure link with other areas of Scotland will see Live Borders members able to access leisure facilities out with the Scottish Borders for free.With approximately . million health and fitness club members in the UK it has never been more popular to get into the gym.And now for the first time, Borders people will be able to access fitness facilities in other Scottish regions with their One Club membership.The scheme, known as the Leisure Link Partnership, will allow people working away from home or on holiday in participating areas to use the local facilities, at no extra cost, as part of their existing home-based membership.Live Bordersrsquo One Club members will now be able to access gym, public swimming and fitness classes at leisure facilities across Highland, Moray, Orkney, The Western Isles, and Argyll and Bute.Ben Lamb, Director of Operations at Live Borders, said: ldquoWe have a commitment to people across the Borders being healthier, happier and stronger, and now this can apply to people visiting the Borders as well.ldquoWe are constantly looking for ways to widen the services offered to One Club members and the Leisure Link Partnership offers flexibility to locals and visitors alike.ldquoAs an organisation, we are very committed to collaborating, and the Leisure Link Partnership is an excellent opportunity for us to work in partnership with like-minded organisations as well as maximise benefits for our members.Many of the inidual Leisure Link Partnership sites will also offer access to other public sessions where cardholders can take part in many other activities such as running and indoor climbing.Visiting cardholders are advised to check out the Leisure Link Partnership section of their local centrersquos website to establish full access details.For more information on how to join visit https:www.liveborders.org.uk health leisure-link "},{"url":null,"title":"nursery-workers-cleared-cruelty-allegations","story":"TWO workers from a childrens nursery in the Borders accused of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner have been cleared following a long-running trial.Thirty five year old Teresa Renton and Nicola Jeffrey, who is , embraced each other in the dock when the not guilty verdict was announced at Selkirk Sherf Court.They had been charged with engaging in a course of conduct likely to cause fear and alarm at Little Reivers Nursery in Duns between January  and August , .The six-day trial heard a number of allegations labelled against the two women - who are both from Duns - regarding practices involving children in their care.But Sherf Raymond McMenamin questioned why the claims had never previously been reported until one worker - who was \"motivated to paint the worst possible picture of the accused\" - made a complaint against them in the summer of  and others then followed.Sherf McMenamin said that taking Rentons evidence alone - he described her as a good witness who was coherent and clear - there was scope for reasonable doubt and therefore a not guilty verdict must follow."},{"url":null,"title":"dreams-come-true-standard-bearer-ronan","story":"AS a young boy Ronan Caine sat amongst the audience in Innerleithenrsquos Memorial Hall and watched both his brothers and cousin being installed as Standard Bearer, dreaming that one day it would be him.For the boy named after the townrsquos Patron Saint, Ronan was destined to be the pride of Innerleithen.Only it was not with a crook in hand as the young Saint, it was to be many years later as a young man clutching St Ronanrsquos Blue Banner.The childhood dream became a reality on Friday, when he graced the stage and raised high the Blue Banner over fellow townsfolk as the Standard Bearer for .His moment in the spotlight came after outgoing Standard Bearer Jamie Boyd, ed it unsullied and untarnished to Games President Alan Patterson.Jamie managed to keep control of his emotions, but it was clear that the honour meant a great deal to him as he fought back the tears.\"I trust that I have carried out my duties of office to the satisfaction of my fellow townspeople.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

between three charities: Edinburgh Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity, Glasgow Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity and the ARCHIE Foundation.While Valerie joined the other artists creating the public

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

Six months later, she remains blown away by the reaction.\"It had an engagement of . million impressions across the world,\" she says. \"I didnt expect it to be as global. It was such an overwhelmingly positive response.\"Dr Krishan, who works as a GP in the East End of Glasgow, has gained a raft of followers who enjoy her warmth, candour and thought-provoking posts on social media where she is an impassioned proponent about the importance of kindness.\"I always say to my medical students and trainees that learning the science is the easy bit,\" she says. \"We can learn from textbooks, absorb the knowledge and spout that out. But it means nothingit is not delivered with compassion and care.\"It is a theme we come back to several times in our conversation. Hearing Dr Krishan talk about her love of being a GP, it is hard to believe she almost never took that path.The eldest of two daughters, she grew up in Glasgow and describes herself as being \"raised on curry and Irn Bru\". Her Indian-born parents arrived from Punjab in the late s. \"We grew up in my dads corner shop,\" she says. \"It was ingrained in us that education was the key to freedom. You were either going to be a doctor, lawyer, accountant or a failure.\"Medicine became an early front-runner thanks to her childhood family GP. \"He was very much a role model for me from a young age because he was the core of our community,\" she says. \"Everyone knew thatDr Kauser saw them, they would be OK.\"A seed was planted for the future Dr Krishan. \"I loved the idea of being able to help and heal people in a community setting,\" she says. \"I admired him and knew education was a must, but then I hit school and everything I loved was wildly dferent to the sciences.\"I enjoyed history and language and music and drama. I wanted to study English Lit, but I was edged into choosing medicine. My mum couldnt understand why I wanted to study English or drama.\":Why we love Glasgows street artHer mother would regularly walk past the University of Glasgow, gaze longingly at its towering spire and tell her daughters that they would one day study there. \"It was almost like she manested it,\" says Dr Krishan, a smile in her voice.\"It was one of her unfinished dreams. My mum had an arranged marriage. She was going to study medicine in India but couldnt because she came to Scotland to be married. Both my sister and I went to the University of Glasgow to study medicine. We are both GPs in Glasgow.\"On paper it sounds like a picture-perfect le trajectory, yet Dr Krishan reveals that in her teens, there was a point when she went off the rails.\"I was a nightmare for my mum and dad,\" she recalls. \"Growing up, I was confused about where I truly belonged. Our summer holidays were always spent in India. I had very much my Indian existence at home, but all my friends were Caucasian.\"There were a lot of restrictions and being told: You cant do this you cant do that ndash what will the aunties think  which I found frustrating. I was always testing the boundaries. I got into trouble at school and was suspended on a couple of occasions.\"When I failed all my exams in third year ndash I got straight sevens in my Standard Grades ndash my mum said she was going to send me to India to finish my studies. She had lost hope. I was given one last chance to turn it around. That was a wake-up call.\"Dr Krishan, who attended Notre Dame High School, knuckled down and achieved the grades to study medicine. \"It was after I became a doctor that I started to feel liberated,\" she attests. \"Then I really felt my wings unclipped after I became a mum.\"The birth of her son Aarish, now six, provided another watershed moment. \"I ended up on a ventilator in intensive care,\" she says. \"My family were told that I didnt have long to live. What happened to me was a complete out-the-blue crisis point in le that gives you a scare.\"She had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage. \"It was a freak, bleed-out episode,\" explains Dr Krishan. \"I went into heart and lung failure, developed clotting issues and widespread sepsis.\"Afterwards, Dr Krishan experienced a le-changing epiphany. \"Everybody around me tried to medicalise me,\" she says. \"Everything was about maybe you need this tablet, when actually all I wanted was support and space to heal. I didnt want drugs to do that.\"I started exercising and eating food to nourish myself inside and out. It is amazing what insights being on the other side of that desk can give you. I ed to work a completely dferent doctor.\"Holistic care is something Dr Krishan regularly applies in her work as a GP. \"I see a lot of poverty and patients living in social isolation, as well as drug misuse. It is quite a challenging population but equally it is a place where you can really make a big dference.\"Around  to  per cent of the things I see as a GP are lestyle-related medical problems. It has become my passion to focus more on the lestyle habits that people form, rather than just the -minute appointment model which is: How can I get you in and out  Can I give you a drug \"She takes her patients on \"Lidl walks\" to share tips on what foods to avoid and how to make healthier choices. Last year, Dr Krishan and a colleague set up Glasgow Wellbeings, a public group where they share their \"health hacks\", which has grown to more than  members.Dr Krishan is married to a fellow GP. \"He started off as an orthopaedic surgeon, but you cant live with me and not become a GP,\" she jokes. Her enthusiasm is clearly infectious, then. \"I would sell it in a jarI could.\"She is currently writing a childrens health book and will make her presenting debut in a forthcoming BBC Scotland medical documentary series due out later this year. Dr Krishan also hopes to pen a memoir about her experiences working as a GP.\"My dream is to write books to help as many people as I can through informed and reflective storytelling in a bid to inspire and empower them along their wellness journeys. I want to bring my Eastern heritage and the wisdom that holds into my scientic Western practice.\":Why we love Glasgows street artThe traditional role of a doctor advocates an evidence-based scientic approach to clinical care. It is important to maintain professional boundaries, yet Dr Krishan strongly believes that patients need compassion too.Such as instinctively hugging a patient who had been diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. Two weeks later, after the man passed away, his family visited her to say thank you and tell her how much that hug had meant to him.\"Le has been kind to me in that it has taught me lessons ndash sometimes in the most brutal ways,\" she says. \"I have been the vulnerable mum and I have ageing parents, so I understand the pain that brings. I have also lived as a troubled teenager trying to find my identity.\"With this man who was dying of cancer, I was helpless. There was nothing I could do. He knew that and I could see the fear in his eyes. It just felt so intuitive [to hug him] becausethat was my father or grandfather, I would have wanted somebody to reach out and say: Its OK, Im here for you.\"Follow Dr Punam Krishan on Twitter and Instagram at @DrPunamKrishan"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10207459.jpg?type=article-full","title":"encouraging-sustainable-transport-explore-5-000-years-scotland-s-history","story":"To help manage the associated carbon emissions from these visits, HES is encouraging greener ways of travel to its castles, abbeys and palaces across the country.Dunfermline AbbeyThis includes helping visitors to plan trips with easily accessible information on the sustainable transport options available to many of its sites ndash such as walking, cycling or public transport.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world.

But itrsquos not a ten either. Massive, once-a-century change is easier to say than to do, but it seems clear that we do sit at the nexus of what may be the biggest political realignment of our lives. On the face of it, the Liberal Democrats are in a prime position to exploit that realignment and become its biggest beneficiary.The fact that people are even talking about it is something of a miracle for a party which was thought of as being clinically dead. The leadership of Vince Cable, notwithstanding the fact he is a perfectly able man with a good record in government and opposition, was, to test the boundaries of the meaning of the word, lsquoquietrsquo.However, an event ndash Brexit ndash has brought the party back to le, and the election of the energetic Jo Swinson has pumped more adrenaline into it. There are parallels here to the Scottish Tory party, which was finished until the event of the Scottish independence referendum gave it a reason to exist.

There is a reason why the Scottish Tories talk about a second independence referendum as much as, or more than, the SNP. They need it. It is the foundation for their single-issue campaign, which has already stretched across three Scottish and UK general elections, to great success, and is about to encompass another, in . Without the second independence referendum, and the ability to whip the unionist vote into a frenzy, what do the Scottish Tories have  Not much, in truth. A set of good, competent people, who would be perfectly able to run a government, but no policy  to make wavering voters ndash the lsquomaybesrsquo ndash feel compelled to tick the box with the C-word in it.Herein lies the lesson for Jo Swinson. The Liberal Democrats, today, is a single issue party. It is a party of Remain, setting itself apart from two parties of Leaveand Labour, a party with a pro-Leave leader who occasionally nods to a change of direction to keep the inhabitants of the tent inside.But, hard as it is to believe today, the Brexit issue is going to go away, and when it does there needs to be something to fall back on. This is precisely the trap that The Independent Group, or Change UK, fell into, andthe Scottish Tory analogy is too far from home for Ms Swinson to contemplate, perhaps this one is easier.Change UK formed with the twin aim of becoming an enduring party of government and stopping Brexit, but reality slapped them in the face with swt, ruthless aggression. You canrsquot be both. You canrsquot be a narrow single-issue party which welcomes only pro-second referendum Remainers and simultaneously be wide enough to be an enduring party of government.So, perverse as this may sound for a party with a hand on the shoulder of  per cent of the population, the success of Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems is not about Brexit.

It was initially the brainchild of a group of product design students from Glasgow School of Art.Since Kaspa became on of the first two dogs selected, it has supported  families across Scotland with highly trained assistance dogs to help people living with dementia.The dogs are trained in a iety of specialist tasks, from reminding someone to take their medication, to reducing anxiety and helping build confidence.When someone with dementia is out and about in the community, the dogs act as an icebreaker, helping counter the isolation often experienced by iniduals affected by the condition, and by their carers.The scheme doesnt just benefit dementia sufferers and their families. It was set up in partnership with the open prison Castle Huntly, which houses low risk prisoners nearing release. The prison provides a training room and outdoor space where dogs can be exercised and taught the specialist skills they need to help someone with dementia. Prisoners can sign up to participate and end up with qualications which can help them find jobs when they are released and ultimately mean they are much less likely to reoffend.Now the unique scheme is under threat, with funding coming to an end on August st and a campaign has been launched to raise over pound, to allow it to continue and expand.

Intimidation that is intensying as a result of Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his policy of opening up the Amazon, the lungs of the planet, to further exploitation. The ancestral homes of the indigenous people are to be cleared.:Boris Johnson to chair first Brexit strategy meeting as no deal plans get poundbn boostWill today be the day we reach  degrees  That was the question being asked on news and TV outlets in the UK last week, just as mining assassins had struck down an indigenous leader in the ever more desperate and rapacious pursuit of profit.It is not a great leap to join these two dots. As the UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said, the mounting violence against indigenous communities is clearing the way for ldquofurther destruction of the rainforest, with all the scientically-established ramications that has for the exacerbation of climate change.As Emryarsquos bloodied body was dumped in a river, a message was being sent. Move off these lands, or die. And with the death of the flourishing of these forests, the climate emergency ratchets up.Bolsonaro is keen to steam roller new tracts of the Amazon. As the director of the Amazon Watch Program, Christian Poirer has said, ldquohis regimersquos reckless policies and its wanton neglect of threatened forest communities is directly linked to rising violent criminality. When he is accused of pursuing mass deforestation, and of covering up for the violence against the peoples living in the Amazon, he simply says it is a lie.But he also wants to disarm criticism ndash in a dictatorial fashion. Since coming to power, he has dismantled government departments who focus on climate change. He has promoted climate change deniers to the highest offices.As soon as he came to power, he signed an executive order that handed the regulation of protected Amazonian lands to the Agricultural Ministry, which is dominated by agri-business interests.Bolsonaro has also displayed a long track record of anti-indigenous sentiment, once commenting: ldquoItrsquos a shame that the Brazilian cavalry wasnrsquot as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated their Indians.The disaster being visited upon Brazilrsquos , indigenous people is a disaster for the world. This is one consequence of the election of Bolsonaro.Last year, I went to Rio and Sao Paulo during the election to speak to activists and to report back to meetings in Scotland on the situation there. I met with campaigners and watched the results come in with hundreds of Fernando Haddad supporters, the candidate up against Bolsonaro. People held on to one another as it became clear, as expected, that Bolsonaro was going to win.:Boris Johnson accused of bias toward DUP on Northern Ireland visitThe very next day, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Sao Paulo and cities across Brazil. In an act of courageous defiance, they made clear they would resist the new regime.I spoke to activists about their plans. ldquoThe initial task is to survive, so we are organising solidarity networks, said one. This response was unsurprising. Attacks against LGBT people were a result of the huge propaganda effort waged by the Bolsonaro campaign.Marrielle Franco, a left-wing councillor in Rio, was shot dead months before. Her face now adorns walls across the city as a reminder of the violence of the forces of reaction in Brazil, as well as resistance unbowed in the face of aggression.I noted two days after the election: ldquoGunmen have attacked an indigenous Bororo village in Mato Grosso do Sul. The attackers destroyed the whole village. This is to clear the way for mining and logging. Clearances for the corporations to move in.Thus, the response from the boardrooms and the ideologues of global capitalism to the election of Bolsonaro was quite dferent from that of the rainforest defenders. The Wall Street Journal backed him to the hilt. He was the choice of the international markets. And more recently, the EU struck a Mercosur trade deal that is catastrophic for the environment. The deal negotiated by the European Commission, has been lauded as historic by Bolsonaro.The deal sees a trade in ldquocows for cars, whereby the EU gains access to markets for cars and other products and services with eliminated export taxes, infor Mercosur countries gaining access to markets for beef, sugar and other goods.Cattle farming is the single biggest contributor to the deforestation of the rain forest. Some  per cent of deforested areas in the Amazon are a result of commercial animal pastures. The deal incentivises the destruction, and it legitimises and entrenches Bolsonarorsquos approach.But that is nothing that wordsmith advocates of corporate globalisation cannot make sound progressive. As the Commissioner for Trade Cecelia Malmstrom put it, the agreement ldquobrings Europe and South America closer together in a spirit of cooperation.This is the internationalism of the neoliberal oligarchy. It is a faux internationalism that exists to perpetuate the elevation of corporate interests over the needs of people and planet.Emrya Wajapi is his name. Found murdered in a river, he and hundreds of thousands like him, are the last line of defence in the Amazon. Ranged against them ndash the violence of men desperate for gold and treasure. A regime that sees them as a pest to be eradicated. And a world system that elevates short-term profit above all .But the rivers are rising. And as the temperatures rise with them, it is time to turn up the heat on capitalism itself.

With Boris Johnson at the helm there are signs that the doctrine of conscience-free libertarianism will be further emboldened following a No Deal Brexit which will cripple the country and the vast majority of its people but buttress the wealthy both economically and politically.Dominic Cummings, senior adviser to Mr Johnson, very recently said that, in the view of the public, Tories do not care about poor people or the NHS. Whilst this statement could well be another part of his grand election strategy to stimulate debate, it is nonetheless true that societal isions have been accentuated under the Conservatives.Ms Sturgeon has introduced a Benthamite dimension to the national discourse at a time when clarity is most required regarding the nature of our values and what sort of country we wish to live in. She will, almost certainly, come in for criticism from political opponents for hypocrisy or idealism or both.A genuinely Utilitarian society may be a Nirvana in many ways, but it is greatly encouraging that we have a First Minister who possesses the ability to convey her vision, display her humanity and provide sound leadership at this juncture of unprecedented national crisis.The well-being and happiness of Scotland may well rest on her guidance in the weeks and months to come.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE letter from James Martinis one of the best examples I have encountered of the use of the word hyperbole. We have ldquocringeworthy, whinging, victim persona, suffer, hate-filled, nationalist faces, screaming, foul mouthed, abuse, misappropriated Saltire, intolerant, ignorance, wanton display of boorishness, nationalist, nasty creed. My goodness, what side of bed did Mr Martin arise from that day The cause of this unmerited fury is the performance of Ian Blackford at Westminster and the crowd outside Bute House for the visit of Boris Johnson. I would commend to Mr Martin several viewings on the BBC Parliament channel of Scottish Questions at Westminster, where he will see behaviour from the non-SNP benches to which most of the above words could be applied, so in addition to hyperbole I see hypocrisy.The visit to Bute House by the PM has been well reported and televised by the media and is still available. After several viewings myself, I see an orderly crowd protesting with the booing being louder than the cheering and all in very close proximity to the PM and FM. What were the police thinking about in letting ldquohate-filled nationalists from both sides so close I take particular issue on Mr Martinrsquos comment on the waving of the ldquomisappropriated Saltire. The Saltire cannot be misappropriated by anyone, it is the flag of Scotland and may be used by those who wish to use it. That the SNP and independence supporters use it is perfectly natural. The fact that Scottish Unionists and especially the ldquoProud Scot iety choose not to, is their decision. We hear about Scottish Unionists rooting for Scotland too and so they should, but the Unionist peg is so shoogly they cannot bring themselves to wave the flag of their home country in ldquoour precious Union ndash shame on them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.I WOULD point out to James Martin that the demonstration in Edinburgh was a peaceful one which left Boris Johnson in no doubt of the strength of feeling regarding Scotlands desire to remain within the EU, and the ultimate horror of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Martin reminds us that the new Prime Minister wasnt \"duly elected other than by a coterie of like-minded iniduals\" but that \"in the UK system the party given the majority chooses who will be PM, not the electorate\". Indeed, but Scotland hasnt chosen a Conservative government since the s, and as Scotland has but  MPs, Wales , Northern Ireland  and England , it is clear that under the UK system everyone gets the governments England elects, and Scotland is facing the unpalatable prospect of leaving the EU because England voted to leave. An affront to democracy which deserves to be protested against.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE SNP and their apologists tell us on an almost-daily basis that Scotland did not vote for a Conservative government. Figures for the  Holyrood elections and  general elections show that SNP votes were . per cent and . per cent respectively indicating that the majority of Scots voters didnrsquot vote for an SNP Government. They complain that Scots didnrsquot vote for Boris Johnson, conveniently forgetting that Nicola Sturgeon was not voted in by the Scottish voters but simply took over from Alex Salmond when he stepped down after losing the  Independence referendum. The same people tell us that Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will. The EU referendum was a UK-wide vote with the result being binding on all parts of the UK. The SNP doesnrsquot accept this.In the  independence referendum  out of  Scottish council areas voted no to independence, so by applying SNP logic it would be reasonable for those council areas voting no in any future referendum to be allowed to remain within the UK. Then again the SNP does not do logic: but it does hypocrisy and cant extremely well.Donald Lewis, Gford, East Lothian.I WONDERit has occurred to Nicola Sturgeon and her party that the reason why they no longer have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and lost so many seats at Westminster is because the Scottish electorate do not agree with their policies, especially that of seeking to break up the UK.Most people are now weary of reading in the newspapers, and hearing on radio and television of the latest rants and moans from Nicola Sturgeon et al.It would not surprise meBoris Johnson found his recent visit to the RN nuclear submarine base at Faslane less grim than that to Bute House.Robert I G Scott, Fe."},{"url":null,"title":"m-middle-class-working-class-roots","story":"The first came from Stacey Dooley, Glitterball winner and documentary maker, the Luton council house girl with no qualications who used to shoplt on Saturdays. These days shersquos on a poundk a year retainer with the BBC. Dooley reckons she now has a ldquobalsamic vinegar and oat milk middle class palate.What the presenter is suggesting is that class can sht. But thatrsquos not what Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard has been saying. The private school educated politician has reconstituted Marxism in declaring that a doctor on poundk a year is working class, because he sells his labour to the NHS.But is middle classness defined by a work contract  If thatrsquos the case is Boris Johnson working class, given he sells his labour to the state, and to The Daily  Wersquove also had BBC Media Editor Amol Rajan declare his own working class credentials in hisdocumentary How To Break Into the Elite, even though hersquos Oxbridge and earns poundk-plus for asking questions such as lsquoWhat defines working classness rsquoRajan would claim we can still claim to be working class eventhe circumstances by which we were defined in the first place have altered  Hersquod argue that although I grew up in a council flat my current postcode of Glasgowrsquos G doesnrsquot reassign me as being a bit Phoebe Waller-Bridge.But is journalism a middle class occupation, given itrsquos populated by a range of income groups  And is lestyle an indicator   Being working class once meant keeping doos was almost compulsory yet Irsquove never raced whippets or thrown arrows but instead play tennis, which is regarded by friends as the slippery slope to cricket.I do go to the theatre, a lot, once regarded a middle-class pastime, but surely thatrsquos changed  Can anyone really argue a night at the Kingrsquos watching Kinky Boots confirms toffery  And I tried opera once, which would have confirmed that I truly had middle class urges, but I have to point out I left at the interval. Yes, Irsquove been on holiday to Tuscany, which suggest something very BBC about me. But I did travel sub-class, which is to say Ryanair.Are material goods an indicator  Well, my car is German, which automatically implies its owner to be middle class. But one colleague said buying such cars is a working class trope. In any case, my pal Big Alex has a bigger one and hersquos a painter and decorator. What about shopping  It sounds as though Stacey does Waitrose, but thatrsquos anathema to me.Or television viewing  I watch a lot of Newsnight, and Channel Four news, which is public school top heavy. But for some reason Irsquom not keen on Anthony Armstrong . Yet, Irsquom not that keen on Danny Dyer either. And where does Love Island fit the class viewing demographic  Bet it wasnrsquot only teenagers in council flats who were delighted to see the lovely Amber walk away with poundk tucked into the back pocket of her red ruffle shorts.Yes, I like to eat out, which is so middle class, but Irsquom not likely to order up an avocado latte with soy milk and granola sprinklings anytime soon. Education  I did go to a grammar school and my best palrsquos dad owned a pub, who bought him an Opel Ascona for his th, but I could barely afford a packet of Opal Fruits at the time.I havenrsquot too many middle-class friends, but I did once have a girlfriend who was at a Swiss finishing school where she dated Roger Moorersquos son, Geoffrey Irsquove been told I sound working class however. A colleague with a private school accent whom I wonrsquot namemaintained that as soon as one opens onersquos mouth onersquos class credentials spill out like Iceland canned soup. Clearly he considers me abetter dressed version of Jamesie Cotter.So have I turned  Alan Bennett believes we donrsquot really leave our class behind, regardless of education and cash. ldquoWhat keeps us in our place is embarrassment.I think hersquos right. We know instinctively wersquore not growing to break into a grouping that is formed by wealthy parents who pay poundk a year to send their children to Eton, Charterhouse and the top jobs. Thatrsquos why  per cent of top judges are private school educated, as are  per cent of the Cabinet. Yet, only seven per cent of the nationrsquos kids go to private school.So Irsquom guessing Irsquom not really a crossover like Stacey. In fact, a female of my acquaintance once said to me ldquoYou know something, Beacom, you have no class. Irsquom sure what she meant was I easily straddle societyrsquos pre-set strata.Maybe."},{"url":null,"title":"comeback-cassettes","story":"The cassette tape is the most unlikely comeback of the st century, with sales hitting a -year high.Spurred on by the vinyl revival, it seems music fans are ing to the humble cassette ndash but is it really cool to spool once again, or is this one fad too far I remember the hiss fondly.Donrsquot we all, but letrsquos not get carried away. Do you also remember the joy of pulling a chewed-up cassette out of your tape deck  Not to mention its habit of jamming, chewing up your beloved album in the process, and the inability to raise the volume above a certain level before abandoning any notion of sound quality.If video killed the radio star, what finished off cassettes The CD replaced the cassette after mini discsfailed to win consumersrsquo affection. But cassettes didnrsquot go down without a fight, remaining a staple in music culture for  years before their terminal decline in the early s.Going up against vinyl LPs and reel-to-reel tape recorders, cassettes achieved massive sales across the world. At its mid-s peak, it sold  million units a year, which was % of total global music sales at the time.The music industry were less easily convinced. They worried about piracy, arguing that home taping was ldquokilling music .Home taping also gave us the birth of the mix tape, a painstakingly personal compilation of songs often put together as a present for the object of your affection. The process of creating the mix tape was immortalised by Nick Hornbyrsquos High Fidelity.CD mixes arenrsquot the same though, are they Definitely not, and donrsquot get me started on the faux USB cop-out being sold in Urban Outfitters. The idea that someone spent hours picking out the perfect songs before sitting hunched over the tape deck hitting record at just the right moment is love which canrsquot be captured with a Spoty playlist.New York music writer Joel Keller previously lamented the ldquodrag and burn method of creating compilation CDs which, he said, was simply ldquoless fun.ldquoI liked it when I sat in front of my stereo, my tape deck, with a big pile of CDs, deciding on the fly which songs to put in what order, he told the BBC. ldquoMy play and record fingers got a little sore because I had to time it right. Listening to the song as it played, finding the levels ndash it seemed like more of a labour of love than it is it do CDs now.Ok, back on topic.

These would be in place for up to three years, although it is unlikely that they would be required for thisof time.The equipment used on the met masts gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.Orkney Islands Council announced in April that is was intending to investigate an additional two sites for potential community wind farms in the county — to add to the project already under investigation on Hoy.The new sites under consideration are located at Faray, in the North Isles, and at Quanterness in St Ola. The aim of the project, which is being led by the OIC#s strategic projects team, would be to generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney.Sweyn Johnston, the council’s strategic projects director, said: “Applying for planning permission for the #met masts# is the latest stage in further investigating the sites we have identied and have been discussing with folk at drop-in events over the last few months.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

It was by no means certain they would get it – with  per cent having their requests turned down – and the average payout was £. One of the main reasons for applications was that people had spent their benefits or income and run out of money.Everyone has a personal responsibility to live within their means and the state simply cannot afford to fund the lestyles of prodigal citizens who refuse to do so and there is always likely to be a small minority of claimants who try to game the system. But the vast majority of cases will be genuine.: Boris Johnson tries to turn focus from Brexit with pledges to boost northern EnglandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereEver since the  crash, there has been growing concern about in-work poverty with some employers paying below the ‘living wage’ – effectively relying on their staff to claim ‘top-up’ benefits, which could be seen as a form of state subsidy for people’s wages, or get a second or even a third job.The growing discontent about standards of living – not just among the poorest – is a serious problem that must be addressed by politicians of all parties. The failure to do so was undoubtedly one reason for the Brexit referendum result. Boris Johnson’s announcement in Manchester of £. billion for ‘left-behind towns’ may be seen as a populist move, but it was at least a recognition of the need for action. The mere acknowledgement that some places have been “left behind” will be welcomed by many who feel exactly this way.But, ultimately, this is a serious problem that is unlikely to be solved by major spending projects by government – whether at Holyrood or Westminster – but by improving the economic performance of the country as a whole. And governments – at local, Scottish and UK level – have a vital role to play in ensuring this happens and duty to co-operate with each other to this end.So it was disappointing that the immediate reaction to the Welfare Fund figures was an attempt to sht blame. Our politicians need to work together to solve this country’s problems, whether they are ones of high finance or more mundane concerns, like the cost of nappies for an infant.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"what scottish unionists can learn from decline of quebec s separatists murdo fraser","story":"Quebec demonstrates that it is possible for unionists to see off an independence movement evenit seems unstoppable, writes Murdo Fraser.It is always useful to look at international and historical comparisons for the challenges we face in Scotland today. One part of the world that has faced similar constitutional issues to ours is the largely Francophone province of Quebec, which held two referendums on the question of independence , in  and . Whilst on both occasions the vote went against separation, in  it did so by the tightest of margins, with just one per cent between the winning and losing totals.Since , however, the notion of independence for Quebec has slipped down the political agenda, with a collapse in support both for it as a concept, and for the separatist Parti Quebecois.In the most recent provincial election last October, the once-dominant PQ secured just  per cent of the vote, with the winner being the soft-nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec .What explains this turnaround in little more than  years  Simply, Quebecers tired of the constitutional argument. A younger generation in the province, still proud of their Quebec heritage, became more comfortable with the notion of being Canadian, secure in the view that a strong federal system protected local decision-making.There is little doubt that the constitutional debates had an economic impact. The banking centre of Canada moved from Montreal to Toronto, largely due to concerns over Quebec separation. A legacy of those times is the irony that today the Bank of Montreal is headquartered not in the city whose name it bears, but in English-speaking Toronto.The debate over Quebec’s future had consequences too for the local electoral landscape. With a first-past-the-post voting system, there was little point in the federalist, pro-Canada parties splitting the anti-separatist vote any more than was necessary. : Nicola Sturgeon challenges Boris Johnson to live TV debate on independenceFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo the Conservative Party of Canada, despite its electoral successes at a federal level, does not contest elections to the Quebec National Assembly. Instead, Quebec Conservatives vote for the Quebec Liberal Party, which despite its name has been independent of the Canadian Liberals – the party of Justin Trudeau – since , and sits somewhat to their right on economic issues.These arrangements are perhaps best illustrated in the long career of the Quebec politician Jean Charest. Charest started his journey as a Conservative in Canada’s federal Parliament in Ottawa, serving as leader of the party there from  to . Then, on the invitation of the Quebec Liberals, he left the federal Parliament – and the Canada Conservatives – to become the provincial Liberal leader, in which position he went on to be elected as Premier of Quebec. He served in that role from -, winning an unprecedented three election victories.While the notion of dferent political parties at dferent levels might seem unusual to us, it is the norm across Canada. Centre-right, pro-Canada Quebecers have no dficulty in voting one way in a federal election, and quite dferently in a provincial one.So what might we in Scotland learn from all this  Firstly, there is nothing inevitable about independence or constitutional change. It might have seemed to Quebecers in the s that nothing would stop the separatist juggernaut, but the voters simply tired of the constitutional debate.Voter fatigue is something we are becoming familiar with. My sense of where we are with Brexit is that there is a growing demand that politicians “just get it over with”. There is little appetite to re-open the independence question here while the Brexit question is still unresolved, and even then I wonder whether the public will be enthusiastic about yet another round of constitutional debate.Secondly, we should not assume that our current political party structures are either optimal, or set to last for ever. Boris Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister has reignited the debate over whether there should be a separate Scottish Conservative Party, an idea I put forward in  when I stood for the party leadership .Notwithstanding my views on the issue at that time, to me the notion that we should split from the Conservative Party as a reaction to Boris’s election as UK leader is as daft an idea as the SNP’s claim that this is an argument for independence. The Union has lasted for more than  years, it has been substantially to the benefit of Scotland to have been part of it for that time, both economically and socially, and to dismantle it as a knee-jerk response to the identity of any one holder of the office of Prime Minister, and lose these advantages as a consequence, would be ridiculous.Moreover,Boris can deliver an orderly Brexit, he may well end up governing the UK as a true One-Nation Conservative. A look at his record in office as mayor of London suggests that is entirely possible, and some of his early announcements – for example on dropping his predecessor’s misguided immigration targets – have been warmly welcomed by Scottish Conservatives.I understand the concerns of Conservative colleagues who don’t want to change our relationship with the UK party. I also appreciate that I have MP colleagues who want to be part of a bigger team, and feel that their constituents should have the right to vote directly for the party of Government in a Westminster election. But,we were to adopt a Canadian model of political parties, that would all still be possible. The key battleground ahead for us is  – the Scottish Parliament elections – where a victory for the SNP with a majority of seats at Holyrood for pro-independence parties will lead to them claiming a mandate for a second referendum. The priority for unionists, of all parties, must be to defeat them in that objective.The lesson of politics in Quebec is that when the forces of federalism come together they can see off the threat of separation. If it worked there, it could work here. At least we should be considering whether the Canadian approach is one we can learn from.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh hotels urged to offer free stays to fringe performers","story":"Organisers of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe want the city#s hotels to offer free and discounted hotel rooms to artists to help slash the soaring costs of appearing in shows at the event.Fringe Society chief executive Shona McCarthy also called for cafes, bars and restaurants to offer Fringe workers discounts rather than see the event as a “cash cow”.She has urged businesses to take an “altruistic” view of the event in future rather than see it as an excuse to hike normal prices every August.: The Edinburgh Festival Fringe :  must-see ing showsMs McCarthy, who cites the cost of accommodation as the biggest single barrier to taking part in the Fringe, said “inroads” were already being made with the hotel sector after they were asked to provide more help for the event.Ms McCarthy, who was appointed in , has previously warned that the event is at risk of becoming “unaffordable” for participants and called for a city-wide commitment to balance the “delicate eco-system” which makes the Fringe happen each year.The Fringe Society has secured more than  discounted university rooms for performers after talks with the sector, while several hundred private home-owners have also agreed to host artists after an appeal earlier this year.Ms McCarthy said the Fringe was under “huge pressure” to ensure it could continue to boast of being “the most accessible festival in the world” and had played its part by ensuring the cost of entry to its programme and box office commissions were kept as low as possible.She urged any business which benefits from the Fringe, which is believed to generate more than £ million for the economy, to consider putting something back into the event and suggested it was valued more overseas than it is in Edinburgh.Ms McCarthy said: “We would absolutely love the hotel sector to come to the party in a big way. We would ask them for two things – an allocation of a number of free rooms for artists and performers and also some rooms on a reduced rate. “We’d love itevery single hotel in the city considered allocating some rooms to artists and performers. It’s not just the top hotels in the city that benefit from the Fringe. We’ve been speaking to a lot of them and are beginning to make real inroads.”“If you look right across the landscape you see that prices for everything go up in August.“We would love to see all businesses in the city have special deals for the artists, performers, creatives and support workers who come to the Fringe to acknowledge that they are the driving force and the rocket fuel of this festival. “We’d basically like to see businesses provide  per cent off to anyone who is wearing a Fringe lanyard.”: Edinburgh International Festival:  musical highlights for Ms McCarthy said she wanted to make a direct plea to all businesses who were “tempted to hike their prices up more than normal” to consider what they could do to help make the event more affordable for participants.She added: “This is an unsubsidised arts festival, where the performers and artists and creative entrepreneurs who set up the venues are the people who take the risks to make the Fringe happen.“There is a huge pressure on the Fringe and everybody involved in it to continue to be the most accessible festival in the world and ensure it remains affordable. There is a real collective commitment to that.“Our call-out to businesses is for everyone who benefits from the Fringe in some way to have some recognition of that and realise that it is not never-ending. “My messages to businesses would be to remind them that the Fringe is an extraordinary thing for Edinburgh and Scotland. It literally brings the focus of the world on to this city for a month every August in an incredibly positive way.“I’m still blown away at how phenomenal the Fringe is in terms of promoting Scotland as an open, international, creative and outward-thinking place. People should see the Fringe as something they should really invest in. “What it does for the city and the country can only really be appreciated when you go to other places and talk to people there.”Russell Imrie, spokesman for the Edinburgh Hotels Association, said: “The financial model of hotels is based on a full year’s performance, not one month’s trading in isolation. “The Edinburgh tourism year is very seasonal from periods of high demand to periods of very low demand. Hotels need buoyant trading months to support months of the year when they trade at a financial loss. Pricing of all travel related products is based on supply and demand. Prices are higher in periods of high demand and lower in periods of low demand. Higher prices in August are balanced by very low prices in low season. Hotel pricing methodology is in line with all other travel businesses.“However, hotels are independent businesses who will make their own decisions. “If a hotel is financially able to offer additional support it will do so, but a unorm scheme across all hotels in the city could not be supported as it would not be financially sustainable for some hotels.”Garry Clark, development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The city’s small local businesses are keen to join in the celebrations around our annual festivals and value the cultural and economic contribution they provide to Edinburgh. “As always, pricing is guided by supply and demand but we know from last year’s experience that increased competition in the accommodation market has led some providers to lower the cost of rooms, even during the festival ­period.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"oh please no edinburgh resident goes viral after fringe rehearsal note left in her stairwell","story":"A Twitter user posted on the site a picture of a note left in her stair from The Counterminers who are her neighbours.window.twttr : Rare Harry Potter book bought for £ sells for almost £,She added just three words: Oh please no.The note advised that rehearsals would be taking place in their flat in the upcoming weeks - for their Fringe show about a monster in a wardrobe - revealing there would be shouting.Its author added: Please dont call the police.

Butwe can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one.“This additional £.bn will ensure we are ready to leave on  October – deal or no deal.”The announcement came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Northern Ireland on the third leg of a UK-wide tour to promote the Union, meeting with the five main parties involved in talks to restart devolved power-sharing.After days of tough rhetoric from Downing Street and ministers who insist the UK will not restart Brexit talks until the EU agrees to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, DUP leader Arlene Foster picked up the baton, accusing Brussels of being “belligerent” and trying to “break up the UK”.Mr Javid’s announcement means a total of £.bn has been set aside to prepare for Brexit.Some £ million will go towards border and customs operations, bringing the total number of border officers added this year to , and boosting capacity to process UK passport applications.More money will be available for training of customs agents, and to invest in IT systems that will make completion of customs declarations easier.Transport infrastructure around ports will be improved, and an additional £ million will be spent to increase ca­pacity for the stockpiling \u2028of medicines and medical products.There will also be an extra £m to boost public communications around getting ready for Brexit.Departments and devolved administrations will be able to bid for an additional £bnthey face further challenges.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the announcement was an “appalling waste of taxpayers’ cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson’s drive towards a totally avoidable no deal.“This government could have ruled out no deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people,” Mr McDonnell said.The spending will be probed by the Commons Public Accounts Committee when parliament s from the summer recess, chairwoman Meg Hillier announced.The Labour MP told the Evening Standard: “The Prime Minister is promising to throw hundreds of millions of pounds at Brexit as though that will solve his problems.“With three months to go before  October there’s not enough time to spend this effectively – recruiting, training and delivering services takes more planning.“The Public Accounts Committee will be looking at how much is spent and what it actually delivers.”Downing Street has said Mr Johnson’s Europe adviser will hold talks with senior EU officials in Brussels to deliver the message that the UK will leave the EU on  October “whatever the circumstances”.David Frost will meet key figures following his appointment as the Prime Minister’s “sherpa” for talks with the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry.

Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts.

Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just . I know Tom’s family will feel proud when we hear about the talent that stemmed from West Belfast on st August as part of the Andersonstown News’ Greatest Hits Night when we’ll be celebrating the music of those days and remember Tom and all the people who kept the music going during our darkest times – we might even get a fish supper in Aldo’s afterwards!• Jog any memories  Let us know anybody or any place you remember through Text  or email Cathy at c.dobbin@belfastmediagroup"},{"url":null,"title":"aer lingus sorry for belfast flight diversion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Either you support the rule of law or you don’t. Jim needs to make up his mind,\" the South Down MLA “I also note that Mr Wells claims to have spoken with those responsible.

My goodness, what a shocking thing to happen in a place where were in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservative Party.\"Mrs Foster said Mr Johnson told her he would never be neutral on the Union but would act in a neutral way in the administration of governance in Northern Ireland.\"Hell never be neutral on the Union and talk of a border poll was not something he was entertaining,\" she said.\"We look forward to working with the new Prime Minister to strengthen the Union.\"Mr Johnson denied a conflict of interest as he was asked about Tuesday nights dinner at the Culloden Hotel with Mrs Foster, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\"Its all there in the Good Friday Agreement. We believe in complete impartiality and thats what we are going to observe,\" he said.\"But the crucial thing is to get the Stormont government up and running again.\"Ms McDonald said the Tories confidence and supply deal with the DUP had \"poisoned the groundwater\" at Stormont.She said Mr Johnson was left in no doubt about her partys views. \"He tells us he will act with absolute impartiality. We have told him that nobody believes that,\" she said.\"He asked for our advice and we have strongly advised him that to make progress here he needs to ensure that he is not the DUPs gopher.\"He needs to stop mollycoddling them. He needs to spell out the realities of le to them and put pressure on his unionist colleagues to ensure we can land on an equitable and sustainable agreement.\" SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon claimed Mr Johnson delivered only bluff, bluster and stock responses during his meeting with her party. He was \"hurtling\" Northern Ireland toward a \"catastrophic\" no-deal Brexit, she said.\"We went into this meeting concerned that he would have a limited understanding of the complexities and the fragility of this place and those concerns have been confirmed,\" she said.\"It is very clear he views and understands the situation through the eyes of the DUP.\"He just retorted with Brexit nearly every question you asked him. Nearly every point we made, he gave us bluff and bluster around Brexit.\"Ms Mallon said Mr Johnsons \"wining and dining\" of the DUP had set the wrong tone.\"It sends a message that he has a cosy relationship with one party here in Northern Ireland and thats damaging to our peace process,\" she added.UUP leader Robin Swann said Mr Johnson and his team \"may be settling into their new roles, but they do not have much time\". He said: \"Northern Ireland has been without devolution for over two years now. Boris Johnson must apply pressure to those who are dragging their feet.\"The indulgence of the DUP and Sinn Fein has to come to an end.\"If a deal is not going to be reached then we made it clear to the Prime Minister that he must move to implement direct rule.\"Mr Swann said he raised concerns about the backstop and was glad the Prime Minister agreed but Mr Johnson now had to unveil his plans for the removal of the mechanism.Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party had \"a frank and candid exchange of views\" with Mr Johnson about Brexit and the Stormont talks.\"It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to come up with such a plan and do so quickly, given how close we are to the clf edge of a no-deal Brexit,\" she said.\"I left todays meeting unawarethe Prime Minister has a plan.

Former Ulster Unionist MP Lord Maginnis made the allegations in the House of Lords last month. Read MoreNIO must be inclusive, says Smith amid royal paintings controversyHowever, last night Secretary of State Julian Smith revealed there is a photograph of the Queen in his office at Stormont House. But Richard Clements from Tully Clements solicitors warned yesterday that the NIOs decision could lead to further claims from people offended by the portraits being removed.\"Will people claim compensation because they are offended that the pictures of the Queen are now removed  The answer to that is, probably,\" he said.\"Until a judge makes a binding decision on the specic issue of pictures of the Queen in the workplace, employers and employees are going to be in limbo as to where they stand from a legal point of view. \"Reasonableness and common sense should apply in the meantime and,in doubt, they should seek independent legal advice.\"Lord Maginnis said the latest move by the NIO has offended a whole section of the community. He added: \"It is making us here in Northern Ireland fundamentally dferent to the rest of the United Kingdom. However, Im not surprised, as for some considerable time I have endured parliamentary answers coming from the NIO where one asks a question and is not given a straightforward answer. \"We have had to put up with this during the tenure of the last three Secretaries of State and its largely why I decided to reveal the depth of conspiracy that exists in the NIO. There is no one accountable in the NIO, and that is from the topdown.\"Referring to the latest NIO decision to remove all photographs, he added: \"There is also a groundswell of absolute disgust, not just in Northern Ireland but also in Parliament, over the insulting behaviour by senior civil servants and its something that Im not going to put up with.\" Lord Maginnis said in light of yesterday developments, it was clear that senior civil servants would need \"fundamental retraining\".UUP leader Robin Swann raised the matter with the Prime Minister during his visit to Stormont House yesterday and said Boris Johnson \"looked puzzled\" when told there is no portrait of the Queen on the walls.Lord Empey, who was among the UUP delegation, said: \"He clearly wasnt aware of it... he was clearly a bit surprised, is how I would put it.\"There was no definitive response from him, but the matter was squarely laid on the table and we shall see what emerges.\"I think both he and the new Secretary of State will be on a steep learning curve to understand the nuances of Northern Ireland.\" Lord Empey said he \"does not think it is unreasonable\" for a portrait of the head of state to hang on the walls of a Government department.\"I think many people would have been shocked that this matter has arisen at all. Its rather bizarre, to put it mildly,\" he added. South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan said the \"shameful decision\" by the NIO had caused \"grave offence\" and further represented the \"hurt and growing anger at the continuing war on Britishness being exercised by republicans\". Mr Girvan said: \"The revelation that the NIO has banned all portraits of the Queen from their buildings is grossly offensive and disrespectful to many people here in Northern Ireland.\"This spineless decision by NIO mandarins, and many others used to erode our British identity in this part of the United Kingdom, is the outworking of the so-called equality agenda that lies at the heart of the Belfast Agreement, heralded as the Trojan horse to break unionists by Gerry Adams.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said the stripping of all royal photographs and portraits from Stormont House was \"shameful\" and something that needed to be addressed urgently by the new Secretary of State.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath said Northern Ireland has many more important and pressing matters to be paying attention to, such as Brexit and re-establishing the Executive.He added: \"Those matters being resolved would do more to improve relations here than the putting up and taking down of pictures.\"We are not going to be in a good position whenever we are weaponising symbols and pictures here - that means we have got to a very dangerous place.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said his party had \"no issue with portraits of the Queen being tactfully and tastefully placed in what is a Government building\". The Equality Commission said it was unable to comment on inidual cases. A spokesperson added: \"The Equality Commission has, for many years, given advice to employers on issues around the wearing or display of emblems in the workplace, and the implications this can have for maintaining good and harmonious relations. \"Tribunal decisions have identied some practices that are or may be unacceptable. \"However, each case needs to be dealt with on its own facts. \"The commission recognises that it is important to reflect on the purpose andof an organisation. \"However, it would not be acceptable for such an environment to be threatening, hostile or unwelcome for employees.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38350932.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Center_Parcs_Longford021.jpg","title":"first look inside center parcs as 233m resort opens at","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell.

The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"happy hounds camera club stars national dog photography day powys","story":"My Border Collie Skye when we first moved to Builth Wells five years ago,ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtquot says Mick Plesltspan classtruncate-full-screengtzkan.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysRecent favourites of my two gorgeous boys for Dog Photography Day, sltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtays Tammy Stretton.lt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysRecent favourites of my two gorgeous boys for Dog Photography Day, sltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtays Tammy Stretton.lt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysTollie having a laugh for National Dog Photography Day from Toni Manltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtnell. lt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysInkie in the bluebells along the Pont Llogel walk from Toni Mannell for Nationalltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Dog Photography Dayltspan classtruncate-full-screengt.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" HAPPY HOUNDS: National Dog Photography Day stars of PowysRescue dog Dougal was editor Nick Knight#s trusty companion over just about ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtall of the Welsh hilltspan classtruncate-full-screengtls and mountains over many years.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"powys new head education appointed","story":"Dr Caroline Turner the new chief executive of Powys County Council, takes the heltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlm on February .lt spangtlt spangt\" POWYS: Has new head of education been appointed Head of education, Dr Alec Clark\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"removing complication","story":"Be more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitBe more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitGet your training off to a great start with this special offer.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"burglary llanidloes see hear anything","story":"Library image of police tape\" Burglary in Llanidloes – did you see or hear anything Library image of police tape\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

TodayIrish language fundamentalists stand at Stormont to welcome our new Prime Minister with a banner that states ‘Rights, Respect and Recognition’.They have all three yet, true to form, demand more. All the while, republicans seek to deny our rights as British citizens, show no respect for the British identity and our Head of State, and seek to strip away all symbols, emblems and other facets that recognise our constitutional status as British..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Unlike republicans, the unionist people of Northern Ireland will not take to the streets in protest at this shameful decision. Unlike Sinn Fein, we will not abdicate our responsibilities to deliver for Northern Ireland through democratic means in order to stand on streets corners waving placards and crying oppression. Yet this should not mask the grave offence taken at this decision, and the hurt and growing anger at the continuing ‘war on Britishness’ being exercised by republicans.Often, we hear about ato Stormont being a tough sell in republican communities. Be in no doubt, it is the same in unionist and loyalist heartlands.Whether it be Mary Lou McDonald and her banner saying ‘England Get Out of Ireland’, or Sinn Féin councillor Catherine Nelson demanding the Secretary of State be ‘sent home’, it is becoming more and more dficult to believe that Sinn Fein are genuine in their commitment to sharing this place with their Uuionist neighbours.Indeed DUP party leader Arlene Foster has raised the removal of portraits of Her Majesty The Queen with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and the Prime Minister.‘Rights, Respect and Recognition’ is the demand for Unionists too. The question and challenge are clear - is Sinn Fein capable of practicing that which they preach Paul Girvan MPSouth AntrimTerror victims are dismayed at Victims’ Commissioner’s stance on pension

One intervened with a comment about it being a personnel issue.“He clearly wasn’t aware of it ... he was clearly a bit surprised, is how I would put it.“There was no definitive response from him but the matter has been squarely laid on the table and we shall see what emerges.“I think both he and the new Secretary of State will be on a steep learning curve to understand the nuances of Northern Ireland.”Emergency council meeting called over Harland and Wolff shipyard crisis Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Lord Empey said he “does not think it is unreasonable” for a portrait of the head of state to hang on the walls of a Government department.“This case goes back to , it was actually secretary of state Theresa Villiers who was in office when the case was settled, so it’s not a new issue, but we made the very simple point that while respecting of course the fact that people here have dferent identities and aspirations, neverthelessyou are working in a UK Government department, it’s not unreasonable to expect to see at some stage a photograph of the head of state,” he said.“Indeedyou go into any American office or an agency anywhere in the States or here, you’ll see a photograph of the president and a vice president of the day, and I can imagine there are people who are maybe not terribly comfortable with portraits of President Trump behind them.“If you go into the Irish embassy in London you see a portrait of President Higgins, and quite rightly.“So it’s not asthere is anything spectacularly new about it, or dferent, but I’m just making the point, given it’s a UK Government department, and Stormont House is part of the Northern Ireland Office which is a Whitehall department, I would have thought it not unreasonable that you would expect to see a portrait of the head of state.“I think many people would have been shocked that the story - which was initially revealed by Lord Maginnis at Parliament, and subsequently by my colleague Lord Rogan, who asked questions and didn’t get particularly helpful answers - that this matter has arisen at all. It’s rather bizarre, to put it mildly.“We will be pursing the matter.”In a parliamentary question response published on Wednesday, Lord Duncan said there are royal portraits at the NIO’s London office.“Royal portraits hang on public display at Hillsborough Castle, and also in the London office occupied by the Northern Ireland Office,” he said in response to a question from Lord Rogan.try catch  TrendingUpdated: PSNI probe sudden death of teenagerManarrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child arrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child\"N.I. mankilled in serious road traffic collision killed in serious road traffic collision\"Three vehicle road traffic collision -

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Some time earlier, MJ had been trapped in the wild.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.
