He grew up in the American south and started his career as a travel writer, but when he moved to New York he discovered that words and sentences could not do justice to the streets he lived on.In the first instance, he has suggested, photography was a cheap surrogate for therapy, a way of slowing Manhattan down and forcing himself to look and find patterns in the apparently chaotic visual scene around him. He started to get a feel for odd coincidences in that chaos – moments when the background of street furniture and high rise and billboard and graffiti and traffic seemed to communicate directly with the people passing by: stripes on shirts that matched zebra crossings legs extending from bus shelters that made a comic tableau with adverts accidents of scale and serendipity that seemed like the fleeting work of an inspired choreographer.Among his favourite pictures in his book, Coincidences: New York By Chance, is this one of a “giant” walking past a billboard on 42nd Street. To Higbee’s delight, extensive Reddit threads and Instagram conversations have been devoted to theories of how the image is made. In the best of his photographs, as here, even when you understand the visual trick, your eye holds on to the illusion.Finding these images is slow work for Higbee. While he might spot the possibilities of a backdrop quite quickly, he watches and waits for hours for the ever-shifting cast in front of it to bring its ironies to life. He says he is lucky to add two images to his portfolio of the uncanny in a month.

The Scottish fiction book of the year went to Ewan Morrison for his novel Nina X, described by judges as a “great feat of imagination, showing digital modernity through the eyes of a young woman emerging from a lifetime within the confines of a Maoist commune”.But Lesley McDowell, who was one of five judges for the fiction award, revealed her resignation in the Scotsman on Monday. She had pushed for Lucy Ellmann’s Booker-shortlisted Ducks, Newburyport – which took the Goldsmiths prize last month, acclaimed as “a masterpiece” – and said she had been backed by one other judge. But according to McDowell, two of the three judges against Ellmann winning admitted they hadn’t finished the 1,000-page novel – a statement that has been strongly contested by the Saltire Society. Eventually, Morrison’s novel was chosen by a vote of three to two.“At this point, I said I couldn’t support the choice because it was a woman written by a man, when there were three women who’d written women on the shortlist and that meant they were saying a man had written a woman better than these three,” McDowell told the .“I said they had to be very sure that their choice stood up against all of that, and that because I did not think it did, therefore couldn’t support it,” she said.In a judging meeting, she cited research by the author Nicola Griffith, which found that books about women by women were least likely to win literary awards, and to VIDA’s annual analysis of critical culture, which consistently shows male authors are more likely to be reviewed.“I was asked if I would never vote for a man, and so had to explain that of course men can and should write women. My own husband’s last book was a woman’s point of view, and half of my last one was from a man’s. But in these circumstances, gender choice matters,” said McDowell. “Every year the Women’s prize has to answer the same question, why do we need a prize for women? Well, the answer was right in this meeting. A woman was being overlooked, her book not even finished.”Ellmann herself told the Observer on Sunday that there was “a tinge of sexism in certain male reviewers’ comments on the book’s length … They’re probably further miffed that it’s a novel about womanhood. The feeling is, how dare a woman, the narrator or the author, take up so much of my time?” she said.McDowell said that none of the Saltire’s fiction panel had read all of the shortlisted titles in their entirety. One of the shortlisted books, Ruairidh MacIlleathain’s Còig Duilleagan na Seamraig, is in Gaelic, but only one of the judges speaks Gaelic. The shortlist also included Bird Summons by Leila Aboulela, You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr and Tiger by Polly Clark. McDowell said she asked Saltire to remove her name from the prize.Ellmann’s publisher, Sam Jordison at Galley Beggar Press, described the situation as “an awful mess”, adding that “it does feel like lightning striking twice for Ducks”. Jordison wrote at length in the Times Literary Supplement criticising the Booker judges’ decision to choose two winners this year, neither of whom were Ellmann.“It’s fine not to win when procedures have been followed properly and reasonably. But when they haven’t, it feels unjust,” he said. He said he admired McDowell’s decision to go public. “It can’t have been easy, but there has to be accountability when these things go wrong and we need truth-tellers like her. I’m still hopeful someone will tell us what the hell happened with the Booker and she’s setting a brave example,” he said.The judging panel for the Saltire prize also included Rosemary Ward, director of programmes at the Scottish Book Trust, Ali Bowden, director of Edinburgh Unesco City of Literature Trust, poet Ken Cockburn and reviewer Alasdair McKillop.Speaking on behalf of the prize, Sarah Mason said: “The Saltire Society and the judges of the fiction award reaffirm that all judges carefully examined all texts submitted for the award. The judges were selected based on their expertise, knowledge and integrity and stand by their decision to award the prize to Nina X. Although only one panel member is a Gaelic speaker all Gaelic books are put to further scrutiny by an independent panel and fully evaluated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd28dbe157b0d025f9dd45d5cf0bccb7f83a5ec/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3f73fabe2209bed3c60e7809754824","title":"quiz are you a born adventurer","story":" Everyone likes to think they’ve got an adventurous side … who hasn’t dreamed of escaping the everyday and taking on a new challenge?

However, homes using smart-meter tariffs can lay claim to a renewables windfall too.Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, said that2,000 homes on the supplier’s Agile Octopus smart-energy tariff “made money for using energy when the wind was giving us more than enough”.Octopus told its customers ahead of time that it would pay up to 5.6p for every kilowatt-hour of electricity used in certain overnight periods.The customers who were able to pop on a middle-of-the-night laundry load could have earned a renewables windfall of between 1p and 5p for every kWh of electricity they used, rather than spending double this rate to run appliances for only a few hours later.Octopus also sends alerts its customers if energy prices are likely to surge during periods of high demand, so they can delay using electricity if they would like to avoid higher bills.The previous wind energy record was set on 8 February at 15.32GW."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ea78fab58ad14975e13a5ce1e97bdcc8a9c79d7/0_170_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd4c86b1168769f3e26f0a9499e143b0","title":"britain young people registered election","story":"Our generation is even more politicised than in 2017, and the spike in registration is a reason to hope that change is comingIs the “youthquake” of 2017 about to be upstaged? After just a glimpse at the voter registration figures for the upcoming election, it looks as if the next quake might chart even higher on the Richter scale. More than 3 million people registered to vote between the election being called and the deadline – 875,000 more than the same period in 2017 – and two-thirds of them were under 35.There was a lot of debate surrounding 2017’s surge in young voting, including whether or not it actually happened. After a “youthquake” was initially declared after the election, a widely reported paper based on the British Election Study claimed that there was no substantial rise in youth turnout – leading many to declare the “youthquake” a myth. But more recent analysis from political scientists Patrick Sturgis and Will Jennings, indicating a large increase in turnout in 2017 among under-30s, suggests it was real after all. There is also much we don’t know about how this year’s youth registration spike will affect the final result on 13 December. Young people are highly politicised, and for a number of reasons. The longer-term forces affecting young people are clear: we are driven towards political engagement because we are more likely to be in debt, working in the gig economy, and stuck in “generation rent” as a result of Britain’s Tory-run economy. But, to work out whether the latest surge in registrations will lead to another quake, we must understand how our concerns have only intensified since 2017.Take Brexit. Three-quarters of young people back a second referendum, and so the effect of watching three years of deadlock in parliament, alongside a swelling, youth-led People’s Vote campaign, can’t be overstated. In the two years that have elapsed since the last general election, news also broke of two notable Brexit scandals – Cambridge Analytica, and the revelation that the Vote Leave campaign broke electoral law. For young remainers who already felt let down by the referendum result, this election presents a genuine opportunity for a second referendum, or to simply reverse the decision altogether.Race and immigration also rank high on young people’s agendas. Our demographic is more black, Asian and minority ethnic, and more likely to embrace multiculturalism, than older generations. We are aware of how hate crimes have risen, and how the far right has rapidly become our greatest threat. In the months following the referendum, I heard many young people of colour talk about feeling betrayed, feeling unwelcome in the UK, and expressing fears that racist undercurrents had risen to the surface. Our anger and hurt have only increased since, with stories like the Windrush scandal and a series of other headline Home Office decisions showing how our communities have been failed. The feeling that both the government and Brexit are continuing to hurt people of colour may serve as a motivator for us to turn out.Most broadcasters and politicians were always going to frame this as the “Brexit election”, but there is another issue at the forefront of our minds. Young people will be around to feel the effects of the climate crisis for longer than our parents, and we have channelled our eco-anxiety into Extinction Rebellion and School Strike for Climate protests over the last year. Both movements speak to a mounting feeling of urgency, and an interest in organising to influence policy. While not all those who are engaged in climate activism will be old enough to vote, two cohorts of that active, politically savvy school-strike generation will have entered the voting bracket since 2017. They will undoubtedly see this election as a means to tackle the climate emergency.The avalanche of youth interest was also accelerated by a collaborative public drive to get young people to register. Celebrity intervention feels as if it has gradually become a mainstay in our politics (which perhaps says something about who we trust) – Stormzy’s social media posts resulted in a surge in traffic on the voter registration website. In other online efforts, Momentum says it persuaded more than 120,000 people to register with its grassroots-funded Facebook ads.Many have warned us not to get too excited too soon. After all, younger voters change address more frequently, and thus are disproportionately represented in new registration figures. And a chunk of those 3 million registrations will have already been on the books. Meanwhile, in terms of actual turnout, the 12 December date is a particularly dangerous obstacle for our demographic, as many university students will be departing for the holidays, and votes in student-dominated constituencies may be affected.But enough of the caveats. Many pundits have said that this is an uninspiring election, that voters are underwhelmed by the choices. But the rise in youth engagement suggests otherwise: that among the young there is palpable excitement about the potential for imaginative, radical change. If this registration surge is reflected in turnout, who knows what may happen? In the recent galvanising spirit of optimism that I found in the Labour manifesto, I see no shame in saying: there is hope.• Micha Frazer-Carroll is opinions editor at gal-dem"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a7492fed86ada7cb4a1a22ad45b7f77041dcf4d/74_263_3343_2006/master/3343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11d1d24f076ecbff0ecb04552c0b5dd4","title":"sun publish far right conspiracy theory labour","story":"On Saturday, the Sun published an exclusive story by its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, which announced that a group of former British intelligence officers had uncovered a “hard-left extremist network” at the heart of the Labour party. “HIJACKED LABOUR” declared the piece, which went on to claim that Jeremy Corbyn sits at the centre of a “spider’s web of extensive contacts” that stretch “from Marxist intellectuals to militant groups and illegal terror organisations”.The piece directed readers towards a website featuring a network map that it said had been compiled by ex-military veterans “in their spare time” to reveal “what they insist is now a party firmly in the grip of a hardline cabal”. Each of the 490 organisations or iniduals listed was presented as a node on a network, with an attached fact file and further reading links.But when readers began to inspect the map more closely, we found that several entries on the chart included extreme rightwing material among their sources. One fact file recommended a “critique” of anti-fascism posted on the antisemitic conspiracy website the Millennium Report – which also features articles on such topics as “the Jewish hand in the world wars” and “exposing Jewish Zionism”. Another fact file pointed readers towards the website Aryan Unity – once the mouthpiece of the British People’s party, a defunct neo-Nazi group. These were presented without caveats, as apparently trustworthy sources.Before the end of the day, the story had been removed from the paper’s website – without acknowledgement or explanation from Newton Dunn or his bosses. (The Sun declined to comment, and Newton Dunn has not responded to my questions.)This was more than a case of sloppy sourcing: the map itself is drenched in conspiratorial thinking. It describes obvious political connections – for instance, that Corbyn and other senior Labour MPs are linked to trade union officials – in a way that implies these are part of a wider shadowy network. This network apparently includes the IRA, Hamas and the Colombian guerilla group Farc “radical” members of the British Medical Association and various anti-war, anti-racist and anarchist groups, many of whom don’t even get on with each other. The chart also links Corbyn’s Labour party to a range of living and deceased philosophers, including Stanley Fish, “Jacques Derrida RIP” and “Richard Rorty RIP”.The argument here is that this “hard-left extremist network” shares an insidious and unpatriotic ideology: “postmodern neo-Marxism”. As one of the researchers told the Sun, this is “an ideology which specifically encourages its supporters to tell lies, because it denies the existence of any absolute truth”. Various independent media outlets were featured on the map, including openDemocracy – George Soros was listed among its funders – as well as a number of high-profile journalists, including  contributors.So how did the Sun, one of the UK’s most widely read newspapers, come to publish it? The answer reveals how easily far-right conspiracy theories now circulate between fringe outlets and the mainstream media. The map linked to by the Sun closely resembles an earlier graphic that first appeared online in August, under the name the Traitor’s Chart. The earliest mention of it that I can find is on an obscure website called Country Squire Magazine, which said it had received a press release about the map. That article, since deleted, had a publication date of 21 August. The website’s only other significant intervention to date has been a pro-Brexit polemic that described Ireland as a “land of puppy farms, rain-soaked holidays, dingy bars, drugs mule celebs, verbal diarrhoea and squeaky fiddles”, also now deleted.The Traitors’ Chart, which was larger than its successor and included the names of even more high-profile journalists, was then picked up by the international far-right media network, Breitbart, whose UK editor, James Delingpole, wrote about it on 27 August. For Delingpole, the map revealed the extent of “cultural Marxism”, which has led to “the takeover by the hard left of every institution so that even when there’s a supposedly ‘conservative’ government in power, it’s the values of the left which continue to dominate everyday life”.Since then, the Traitors’ Chart has been revised and rebranded as Hijacked Labour: the website that hosted the original was closed down and a new one registered on 3 December, a few days before the Sun’s “exclusive” appeared, this time with a new frontman for the project – a former SAS officer and author named Mark Bles. (Since the Sun took down its story, the map has been revised once more, removing the links to neo-Nazi and antisemitic websites.)Conspiracy theories offer a simple way to explain complex power relationships and patterns of cause and effect. Iniduals are more likely to turn to them when they feel powerless or when they lack the tools to analyse the world in other ways. They can flourish within any political tradition – look, for instance, at the “Corbyn did Brexit” rhetoric among some liberal remainers, who believe he sabotaged the referendum. The defensive and evasive behaviour of the Labour leadership over antisemitism in its own ranks, meanwhile, has caused great damage. But conspiracy theories become a lot more dangerous when they are cultivated and amplified by prominent media platforms – and this is overwhelmingly taking place on the right.As the story of the Traitors’ Chart indicates, a global online ecosystem has grown up in the last few years that bridges the gap between the far right and the mainstream – and, in the case of outlets such as Breitbart, there is significant financial backing involved. In the UK, there has been a concerted effort from mainstream conservatives to depict Corbyn, and by extension the whole Labour party, as a deadly threat to the nation. His past associations with Palestinian activists and Irish nationalists his opposition to British overseas military action – all these and more can be criticised or defended on their own merits, but in the right’s narrative they make Labour not only objectionable but democratically illegitimate.The election has raised this to a fever pitch – and it comes after three years in which the pro-Brexit right has portrayed anyone who appears to stand in its way as an enemy of the people, to borrow the Daily Mail’s pungent phrase. Today, Boris Johnson launched his last week of election campaigning by trailing a speech in which he accuses Corbyn of a “great betrayal” over Brexit.The broad impact of this stab-in-the-back rhetoric has been to toxify political debate, but it has more acute effects too. Since 2016, we have seen the murder of one Labour MP by a far-right conspiracy theorist who proclaimed “death to traitors”, and a neo-Nazi plot to murder another MP. A far-right social media activist has been convicted of harassing a former Conservative MP who opposes Brexit he also called her a “traitor”. In recent weeks, three Labour canvassers have been attacked in the street: among them, a woman in her 70s in Herefordshire whose assailant ranted about Marxists, and a man of similar age in Rotherham who was taken to hospital with a suspected broken jaw.Abusive language has flown in many directions as the UK’s politics has become more turbulent, but what’s coming from the right is of a different order altogether – not least because it is being boosted by several mainstream newspapers. What is particularly worrying about the Sun’s publication of a toxic conspiracy theory is that the story was written by its political editor – a veteran journalist with years of experience as a defence correspondent who appears frequently on the BBC. It’s not good enough for the Sun to simply remove it – the paper needs to apologise, and to explain what it got wrong and why.• Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe, and Bloody Nasty People: the Rise of Britain’s Far Right"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbcb7b71430cc7b5bc7f86329929098e9dd9fea/0_2_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5948217ef55985faec80c7a8de679eb0","title":"whoever wins the election we all need to start talking to each other","story":"Britain has never been more ided. On Friday we need to get out of our comfort zones and begin learning and listeningIt’s pitch black, and I am using a white cane to tap out the ground in front of me. I feel scared, but I have a guide who says: “Walk towards me. I am here. Follow my voice. What can you hear?” There is birdsong, traffic and the sound of children. The ground feels first gravelly and then soft. Is it grass? “Am I in a park?” I ask my guide.I am at an exhibition called Dialogue in the Dark, which has toured more than 45 countries and has employed more than 7,000 visually impaired people as guides. This is a project about social inclusion. Diversity may be a buzzword, but what does it mean when designers continue to make no-go spaces for people with disabilities?This immersive experience takes sighted people out of their comfort zones. In the dark, I talked to the two guides, had coffee and biscuits with them and learned practical stuff about how to cross a road. What I liked most was the chatting, the dialogue. How do you choose your clothes, my daughter asked our guide. What about phones? A new world was revealed to me. One of the guides showed me an Instagram post of her paintings.In these dark times I left with respect. Martin Buber’s philosophy is at play here: “The only way to learn is through encounter.”This experience – learning, listening, being taken completely out of my comfort zone – is the opposite of how the world feels now. This election is not about dialogue. It feels like people screaming their moral certainties into a void. The idea that ision can be settled by this is clearly wrong. No healing can happen until we properly acknowledge how broken we are. The first-past-the-post system is not fit for purpose most votes are wasted unless you live in a marginal constituency. Saying: “I am not going to vote, or I may spoil my paper,” brings down righteous wrath. If I say I cannot bring myself to vote Labour because of antisemitism – essentially a conspiratorial worldview that flows out a particular set of hard-left politics – then people abuse me for not caring about homeless people. There is no conversation, simply condemnation. How that works on the doorstep, I don’t know.If all Labour people are inherently good and everyone else inherently bad, we end in the ludicrous position where Corbyn has to be held up as the personification of virtue. He reiterates that he is anti-racist in a “l’état, c’est moi” way when the bigger question is over systemic refusal to act on cases of antisemitism.I can’t go along with this, despite seeing some excellent things in the manifesto and having written about Borisconi’s venality for years.Neither as funny nor as clever as he is made out to be, Boris Johnson is now just some posh automaton who blurts: “Get Brexit done,” at regular intervals. The thought of working-class voters buying this is lamentable – but it’s happening to the extent that Labour can no longer claim to be a working-class party. The fallout from Brexit has fractured the parties.What is striking is the total failure of imagination that characterises today’s isiveness. If the best thing that Labour created is a vision of a different world, then surely its supporters can imagine another world where you feel distrustful and taken for granted. When the MP Tracy Brabin, who took Jo Cox’s seat, tells us that many of her constituents felt that with the referendum they were on the winning side for the first time in their lives, we might do well to listen.Dismissal is always a damn sight easier than dialogue, that’s for sure. Why are all these vox pops with old white northern leavers, I hear people ask. Why do we not acknowledge that the working class is young, urban and multi-ethnic? Fine – so what can glue together a coalition between such groups?I am voting tactically, which feels the only sensible thing to do. It is not only an admission of the failure of our system, but an acknowledgment that Labour on its own can’t get the Tories out. People remain unconvinced that a more centralised state can deliver all that Labour promises. The left continues to underestimate the aspirational power of independence in every cultural narrative – personal independence from the state and nationalist independence for the countries of this disunited kingdom. Freedom is a precious thing. Let us decide our own destinies. Let us decide who we are and how we live.This is why identity and not pure economics governs the discourse, even though we are told this is irrational. Insecurity has produced this fragmentation, as well as Brexit. Economic austerity is not the only driver of the impoverishment of the imagination. Remain has so often outdone leave in nostalgia for a mythical time of harmony.In such an atmosphere of distrust, not just of politicians but of anyone who may vote differently, we have to ask on Friday: how do we go on? I ask this of Labour because the Tories have so little capacity for self-reflection. They are a machine to win power, by whatever ideology necessary. But how to edge forwards?As I passed through Dialogue in the Dark, I trusted someone to lead the way. I emerged not with fake sympathy, but with respect. Trust and respect: the groundwork for dialogue.There has been a lot of talk lately of Antonio Gramsci’s insight about the new world struggling to be born I think it has already been born, and we just didn’t notice. He also once told us what culture means: “I believe it means thinking well, whatever one thinks, and therefore acting well, whatever one does.”As the moral high ground now seems a place to huddle or hide, I like such prosaic advice. Vote as best you can. And the next day act as well as you can. Dialogue in the cold light of day would be a start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9457a4e96c5a7572ba4e2c1fc4496d430e83a00e/0_892_5181_3108/master/5181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8385101226b8861d6ceb95c729115787","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of bake","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘bake’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘bake’.Share your photos of what bake means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 11 December at 10am.

Once one of the largest concentrations in Europe, the seahorse population collapsed between 2016 and 2017. The only explanation, he says, is poaching.In November, five people said to “specialise in the use of explosive devices” were arrested by the Taranto coastguard in an operation that uncovered several kilograms of explosive material and TNT at the city’s mooring dock.The previous month the coastguard seized 228 plastic buckets of sea cucumbers – weighing four tonnes – hidden in cargo ready to be shipped to Greece from Brindisi, one of the region’s largest ports. “This was part of a bigger activity,” says Giorgio Castronuovo, commander of the Taranto coastguard, who is leading a criminal investigation into wildlife trafficking.“What we can say is that the Italian market does not have a demand for these species, so it must be international,” says Castronuovo. “Until a few years ago, there was no interest. When the demand started from abroad, fishing began.”Manna, through the Italian investigation website Veraleaks, uncovered evidence that in addition to formalised trafficking transactions the species are sold on the Chinese social media site WeChat, where products are advertised as coming from “Italy, the Mediterranean”. They are also sold by third-party sellers, who claim to offer “wild capture” through online retailer Amazon. Tencent, the owner of WeChat, said in a statement: “We are vigilant against unscrupulous parties making unauthorised use of our platforms and services to pursue illegal activities. We encourage users to report illegal and inappropriate activities.”A spokesperson for Amazon said: “All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The product in question is no longer available.”Authorities say that local fishermen have close ties with Chinese traffickers who transport species of seahorses and sea cucumbers in huge numbers, by air or by sea, often passing through Greece on the way to south-east Asia. The practice, they say, is happening all along the Puglia coast at fishing villages and towns.The coastguard says that on the bottom rung, local fishermen receive about €0.80 (£0.70) per kilogram for sea cucumbers. For the middlemen who clean, prepare and store the creatures, the value increases to €7 a kilogram. By the time sea cucumbers enter the Chinese market, prices rocket to between $200 and $600 per kilogram. Seahorses can be worth $700 a kilogram in Asia at the end of the chain, according to the coastguard.In China many people believe seahorses are a powerful aphrodisiac. They are used in traditional medicine, to create a precious liqueur, or simply as ornaments. Sea cucumbers are consumed as food, or used for medicine and cosmetics.“It’s anarchy,” says Sergio Passarelli, a marine biologist at Mare per Sempre, an NGO that owns the only permit to scuba e in the Mar Piccolo. “From Taranto down to the Ionian Sea they fish everywhere there is sand, rocks and algae.”Campaigners say they have received threats from criminal groups and are concerned about the limited efforts by authorities to thwart the trade. “I have received warnings against my life for the work I do,” says Manna. “Fishermen unload wherever they want, the fish is not checked, but weighed and sold on the black market.”Rinaldo Melucci, the mayor of Taranto, says the authorities are doing all they can to tackle the problem. “The municipal administration will put any information from its current video surveillance system along the affected area at the disposal of the competent authority and is starting to strengthen this survey network, while at the same time preparing supplementary control services from the local police,” he says.There are about 40 species of seahorse in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and more than a quarter are considered vulnerable or endangered. An additional 17 species, including both of those found in the Mar Piccolo – the Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus – cannot be reliably classified in terms of global-level risk and are therefore listed as “data deficient”.An estimated 37 million seahorses are caught each year, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora notes that they are threatened due to “overfishing and unsustainable trade”.Dr Miguel Correia, a Portugal-based collaborator with the international research institute Project Seahorse, who also carried out research in Taranto, warned that the trafficking network extends beyond Italy and across southern Europe. In 2017, Spanish police arrested traffickers in Cadiz in possession of more than 2,000 dried seahorses.“They are operating here in Portugal and other countries,” says Correia. “If it continues they could completely disappear.”This reporting was supported by the Internews Earth Journalism Network"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b8445913ad092fdafcf323821522d6f41be157/0_244_4090_2454/master/4090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a2288ddf853e36233a7a1d4898d15a","title":"cop25 climate summit what happened during first week","story":"Activists were left frustrated by the lack of urgency inside negotiating rooms in MadridWhat happened in week one?The COP25 climate talks in Madrid may have officially opened on Monday 2 December, but they only really started on Friday evening. That was when Greta Thunberg arrived to join a 500,000-strong march through the centre of Madrid, demanding that world leaders listen.The young activist said that she, and the millions who have marched and protested around the world in the last two years, had “achieved nothing” because greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. Her stark message summed up the disjunction that scientists, campaigners and some politicians have despaired of at these talks: that the sense of urgency scientists have warned is needed, and that is felt in the outside world among those worst affected by climate breakdown, is still missing from these negotiating rooms.Meanwhile, negotiators finally managed over the weekend to put out a text on the future of carbon markets. It is only a first step and there are still major disagreements over how carbon credits should be counted and how countries’ success in meeting previous carbon targets should be allowed to count towards their future targets.There is still no guarantee of any resolution to the disputes over carbon markets – the so-called article 6 talks, named after the section of the Paris agreement that they are aimed at clarifying. If this issue is not resolved, this technical question will hang over next year’s talks too, getting in the way of the substantive issue: the fact that by next year at the latest, countries are supposed to realign their emissions-cutting targets with scientific advice on staying within 2C (and hopefully 1.5C) of global heating above pre-industrial levels.These talks were supposed to take place in Chile, but were relocated after political unrest in Santiago. There are reminders everywhere that Chile is still technically the host – in the logo and signs in the leadership of the Chilean COP president, Carolina Schmidt, at every important meeting the conference rooms named after Chilean landmarks, rivers and natural features and in the protests outside the conference centre by Chilean democracy and social justice campaigners, who say they are being silenced and ignored.Oceans campaigners have also struggled to be heard at these talks, which were meant to highlight the plight of the oceans and the vital but often overlooked part they play in the Earth’s climate. The key message from campaigners is that protecting marine life – stopping overfishing, stemming the plastic tide of pollution and the flow of fertilisers and chemicals that is suffocating fish – is not just vital to bioersity, and healthy fisheries for the more than 1 billion people who depend on the oceans, but also to regulate the climate. Healthy oceans absorb carbon and provide a buffer against climate chaos, so damage to them is damage to the climate, and vice versa.Campaigners took advantage of the move to Madrid by drawing some of the Spanish capital’s cultural icons into the climate fight. The Prado art gallery, in conjunction with WWF, has updated some of its most famous paintings to show how they might reflect a warming world, with Goya now depicting climate refugees and a Velázquez painting of Felipe IV showing the Spanish king up to his horse’s neck in flood water. Which makes participants wonder what other Spanish artists might have made of the talks. The tortured technicalities of article 6 would test the skills of a Picasso – though the surrealism of Dalí might be more appropriate. Melting watches could stand for how negotiating time seems to have stopped, while poles and glaciers liquefy.Youth has taken over for the start of the second week, with activists making their presence felt at the conference centre on Monday, fresh from the weekend’s marches and protests.On Tuesday and Wednesday, environment ministers and finance ministers will arrive to give directions for their officials, meaning the “high-level segment” of the talks can start and with it the actual decision-making needed to give these talks a concrete outcome, in the form of resolutions on key issues.The EU is also expected to galvanise the talks with its green new deal proposals from the European commission on Wednesday. In normal circumstances the UK, as the host of next year’s COP, which marks the deadline for countries to update their Paris commitments, would be expected to play a key role here. But the its delegation has been hobbled by the general election, which means officials and the next COP president, the former UK climate minister Claire Perry O’Neill, are in purdah and cannot speak on the record. Perhaps by Friday, when the UK’s votes have been counted, there may be some much-needed clarity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/388700cfee235cda6c8a37ff30a9806f749a315c/0_340_5052_3032/master/5052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d3ce78e6f6c21ffead92cb22b10742","title":"scottish wildlife government funding aoe","story":"Scottish Environment Link, a coalition of more than 35 wildlife, environment and countryside charities, including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF and the Scottish Wildlife Trust, estimates almost £100m has been slashed from the budgets of public agencies in Scotland between 2010-11 and 2019-20.The group described the cuts as “staggering”, given the climate emergency and bioersity crisis. The agencies affected are Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) and several research institutes, including the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and Scotland’s Rural College.The Scottish government said the analysis gave a “misleading picture” and did not take into account EU and other sources of funding. Budgets had been constrained by UK-wide cuts, it said.Deborah Long, Scottish Environment Link’s chief officer, said: “Obviously there’s a lack of resources across the board: in the NHS, in policing. But what we’re seeing is that cuts to environment have been ongoing and we’re at a stage where if we want to tackle the bioersity and climate crisis, that needs to be reflected in budgets.“If we are going to tackle the bioersity and climate crisis you can’t do that with no money and no staffing.”Citing Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, who announced a climate emergency and the need for “transformative change” seven months ago, Long said there was a significant mismatch between words and action.“We can definitely see it reflected in the stresses in what the agencies are trying to do,” Long said. “There’s a need for action on the ground and for monitoring, Both of these are under severe stress. It is easy not to act until it’s too late.”Taking account of inflation, the analysis showed funding has dropped overall from £246m in 2010-11 to £147.5m in 2019-20. It looked at Sepa, Scotland’s environment regulator, SNH and the research bodies covered by the Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (Resas), and used draft budget equivalent figures, measured in 2019 prices.The report says UK government austerity measures are partly to blame.Ruchir Shah, the director of external affairs for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, described the analysis as “stark”. “It is counterproductive to shift resources away from nature as it has been shown how important it is to health and welfare,” he said.Aedán Smith, the head of policy at the RSPB in Scotland, said: “This definitely illustrates not only have we been underfunding nature and the environment but actually reducing funding. A transformative change is required. We need to be embedding tackling climate change and reversing the decline in nature.”A Scottish government spokesperson said the Link figures were inaccurate. “This analysis provides an incomplete and misleading picture of government spending on environment activity and relevant agencies,” they said.“It does not include other sources of funding nor recognise how the shift from one EU CAP programme to another might have affected the availability of funding for internal government research. It also does not include the full picture on other sources of funding such as European funds or in-year budget adjustments.“While budgets have been constrained over the past decade due to UK budget cuts, we have worked hard to provide our environment agencies with the necessary resources to fulfil their statutory functions and enabled them to increase revenue through environmental charges making polluters pay towards protecting our natural resources.”It had also expanded the range and number of agencies working in this area, it said.The SNH said that because of additional funding for peatland restoration from the Scottish government, its budget since 2017-18 had increased. It pointed out its European funding had also increased and “this year the Scottish government announced a £2m increase to the Bioersity Challenge Fund”.A Sepa spokesperson said its staffing levels had remained consistent through the decade.Sepa said its baseline budget grant from the Scottish government was £34.2m in 2008-09, compared with £31.7m in 2019-20. Link’s figures were £45m in 2010-11, down to £34.4m in 2019-20."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/999b6c3ac1730442e3a7b8c9c4ce3896f55b7935/0_103_2556_1534/master/2556.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e73b65ae2293af4dff2c16fed74d0f0","title":"golden globes marriage story irishman greta gerwig","story":"The all-male directors nomination list is dismaying in an awards announcement that has done well by the wonderful Marriage StoryAssessing awards season for snubs has become a favoured form of critical jiu-jitsu in recent years, and maybe it is too easy when a five-strong nomination list in any category inevitably has to miss people out.But it is a little bit heart-sinking that the Golden Globes 2020 list of best director nominees is an all-male affair, with Greta Gerwig’s direction of Little Women not making the cut, and not making it on to the all-male best screenplay nomination list either.The frontrunner is Noah Baumbach’s seductively gorgeous and lacerating Marriage Story, with six nods. It is very funny and serves up the delicious confectionery of insider showbusiness politics – although it is actually credited in the serious “drama” category, not comedy. It is a wonderful film: smart, intelligent, humorous film-making for grownups, although perhaps it should be conceded that the lives involved are on a higher and more rarefied material level than the film quite admits. Divorce is a brutally expensive affair on the basic financial level, but no one in the film is shown getting any poorer than they were.In the silver medal position is The Irishman, Martin Scorsese’s monumental late-period mob movie about Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, a Philadelphia hitman rumoured to have had something to do with the mysterious disappearance of the Teamsters’ union boss Jimmy Hoffa in 1975. It’s a minor-key mob epic a movie about mobsters growing old, about our favourite actors famed for mob roles getting old, and about getting old generally.The Irishman has five nods but very oddly, no best actor nomination for Robert de Niro as Sheeran, which I think is a shame. What a colossally impressive film it is, made with such amplitude, such authorial confidence, such artistry. Coming up jointly with The Irishman is Quentin Tarantino’s dazzling, provocative, sensual and brilliant Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: a superb film a thrilling and disturbing black comedy.As for the box-office smash Joker, the Batman-villain origin story gets four nominations. I am in a minority (though not a minority of one) in finding it a shallow, ugly, boorish film, stridently but incorrectly convinced of its own coolness, and with a decent but not great lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who has been better in so many things. The crass and unearned allusions to Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy are just reminders of how much better those films were.Among the rest, The Two Popes is doing very well with four nominations – it could be this year’s Green Book, and I intend that comparison with my fingers almost falling away from the keyboard in ennui. The Two Popes is a gentle, lenient and indulgent bro comedy (or perhaps fantasy) about Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins) handing over the Papacy to the supposedly more liberal Pope Francis I (Jonathan Pryce). It is a nice film, sure, but determinedly indulgent, conjuring a personal and theological happy ending which I’m not sure exists in real life.But it is Marriage Story, the sweet, sad story of love’s mortality, which has surged ahead in the Golden Globes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28e6a6376cb13f91f89a8e781d1783692b77c2f4/0_0_1945_1167/master/1945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfb64c286057a6b229239f1b1ca96f84","title":"ricky gervais returns as golden globes host for a record fifth time","story":"The comedian will host the 77th edition of the TV and film awards, adding that organisers had made him ‘an offer I can’t refuse’ Ricky Gervais will host the Golden Globes for a record fifth time in 2020 – despite previously claiming he wouldn’t present the awards show again. The comedian, who hosted the show between 2010 and 2012 and again in 2016, will reprise his role for next year’s 77th edition, once again stating that this will be his final year as host. In a statement, Gervais said that the organisers the Hollywood Foreign Press Association had “made me an offer I can’t refuse. But this is the very last time I’m doing this, which could make for a fun evening”.Despite having been the target of his humour, Soria has praised Gervais’s return, stating that “when Ricky Gervais is at the helm of the Golden Globes awards, we can always expect the unexpected”. “There is always a palpable electricity in the room when Ricky takes the Globes stage,” added NBC Entertainment Chairman Paul Telegdy. “His return as master of ceremonies at the Golden Globes is much anticipated … we can’t wait to see what he has up his sleeve.”The Golden Globes will take place on 5 January 2020 at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, airing live on NBC in the US with red carpet coverage shown in the UK on E! Entertainment. This year’s ceremony was hosted by comedian Andy Samberg and Killing Eve star Sandra Oh, drawing the lowest ratings since Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted in 2015. Neither the Oscars nor the Emmys had a host at all in 2019, and the Globes were hostless prior to Gervais’s appointment in 2010."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0d93cf63672bc6ed31c0bc3dac2a413ee0fbaf7/0_298_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1469f55b9fdba24f2ed6a1da978c673","title":"christmas starter thomasina miers recipe for buckwheat blinis with ricotta and salmon","story":"A delicious festive starter that can be adapted to serve with a sweet topping for the kidsMeera Sodha’s vegan Christmas starter of kimchi gyozaSmoked trout is a delicious alternative to smoked salmon.

Clearly our leaders cannot be trusted to set the right toneDon’t just take Gary’s word for it. Ask the UN, who have in the last year criticised British politics for exactly this, with specific reference to the “hostile environment” shambles on immigration policy and the insidious rhetoric around Brexit. These things don’t happen in a vacuum. There is a price to be paid.On Monday it emerged Tottenham Hotspur had expelled a child from their stadium for allegedly racially abusing Son Heung-min during the game against Burnley. Elsewhere two Wolves supporters were ejected from the Amex Stadium for homophobic abuse, another form of viciousness on the rise at football, as it is elsewhere.So Neville was right to talk about politics in response to the news a man in the crowd had appeared to racially abuse Manchester United players at the Etihad on Saturday. Firstly because if not now, then when? And secondly because politics is talking to sport all the time, informing its tone, its voice, its discourse.Neville was right also to refer specifically to Boris Johnson, who has ridden these tides more successfully than anyone else. When Johnson pronounces on immigration or presents himself as the hammer of the shadowy ruling elites, it is still hard to feel he really believes what he’s saying himself, hard to conclude he isn’t simply doing this to score points, or simply because he knows it works. This is where we’re at now: a prime minister so inauthentic you start to suspect he isn’t even a real racist.Credit where it’s due, though. In his tribalism and his command of ision Johnson appears to have a perfect understanding of the way crowds work. And beyond that, of the way the shouty polarities of public life have begun to follow a familiar football-crowd pattern: to be so easily led, and so easily led the wrong way.With this in mind it was heartening to hear that Pep Guardiola had comforted Fred in the tunnel after the Manchester derby, although Fred says he wasn’t aware of the abuse until he returned to the dressing room and saw the TV footage (for the record, the man in question insists he is innocent and was simply putting his hands down his pants).It was also encouraging to hear Ole Gunnar Solskjær try to separate the two elements – racist abuse, club identity – in his post-match press conference. It was entirely right, too, that City have promised to take immediate and decisive action. This is not a problem the club has historically carried. City are from Moss Side originally, a racially mixed part of Manchester. Black supporters and players have long been a part of the club, from locals such as Alex Williams to the more recent roster of stars.This is the good side of Saturday afternoon. As for the bad side, well, that starts pretty much everywhere else and goes on from there. East Manchester was a poisonous place generally, not helped by the witless decision to kick off at 5.30pm. The vibe at the Etihad was fractious, pent-up and – let’s face it – jaw-grindingly intoxicated in parts.Zoom out a little wider and from the moment pictures of the alleged abuse first appeared on the internet the digital periphery was jammed with the usual tide of blame, finger-jabbing and that particularly modern strain of gloating that seems to have little to do with rectifying the ills of prejudice and ision.It is by now a familiar cycle, what we might call the Evra Dialectic. A racist incident happens. Outrage follows, much of it oddly gleeful, characterised by name-calling and demonising of other fans of the “guilty” club.A vocal subsection will then reply by “backing their man”: dissembling, denying, blaming “the media”, listing the other club’s own assorted wrongs. And so we enter the dead zone of insults and counter-claim, deluded badge-loyalties and a refusal to accept the evidence of our own eyes.It is a trap football falls into so easily and at every level. Perhaps it is time to talk again about Guardiola, who a year ago blamed the media, with some justification, for publishing racist stereotypes that contributed to the abuse of Raheem Sterling at Chelsea.Fast-forward to Bernardo Silva, Twitter and the publication of a more guileless form of cartoon stereotype on the internet, for which Silva received a one-match ban from the FA. This time Guardiola backed his man to the hilt, refused to offer any condemnation, defending pretty much the same kind of ill he had so righteously condemned.Three months later we have monkey chants at the Etihad. The two are not directly connected, of course. Idiots need little assistance to be idiots. But as has been quite rightly levelled at the wretched Johnson, leaders also have a responsibility to set a tone, to show the best of us. One lesson of our current politics is that people listen to the messages they’re given.Blind tribalism is also something football can resist. So much hard work is poured into education and regulation by well-meaning but essentially limited organisations such as Kick It Out. So much glossy lip service is offered by the sport’s authorities. But those who watch and support have an agency of their own, the ability to act as a balm not an irritant.Perhaps it might be wise to start by changing fundamentally the way football talks about these incidents, by moving away from the idea that this is “a Manchester City fan” who stands accused of abusing Fred. Club loyalties are irrelevant here, as they are in every other form of crime.Everyone loses, everyone suffers in this situation, just as everyone should feel sympathy and regret, not simply those who wear the same replica shirt.Backing your man, backing your tribe, dealing only in blame and ision – this is the poison football, sport, everybody with a vote needs to resist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbf86f3e7643d205d739386da14efbfe9562959b/0_445_4094_2455/master/4094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2e670e43febc541eb35a25394d8adb5","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool salzburg","story":"The Austrian media who were expecting a bit of light-hearted banter with Jürgen Klopp at the Red Bull Arena were to be disappointed. It was not the time or place. There was confusion over where to sit alongside Jordan Henderson at the pre-match press conference, a TV light on full beam was shone directly into the face of the Liverpool manager, who then had to correct the interpreter over a mistranslation of his captain’s words. “As you can see,” said Klopp by way of apology, “I am in competitive mood already.” Salzburg should know to expect nothing less.Liverpool find themselves on familiar ground in the final game of their Champions League group: needing a result to qualify and to keep alive hopes of reaching the final of every European competition they have played under Klopp. Two years ago they needed to avoid defeat against Spartak Moscow and won 7-0. Last season they had to beat Napoli, one of the teams who could prompt the holders’ elimination on Tuesday, and won 1-0. RB Salzburg have “nothing to lose” according to their prolific 19-year-old striker Erling Braut Haaland, who has predicted a 3-1 win for the Austrian champions and a hat-trick for himself in “the biggest game of my career so far”. Liverpool know what it takes to win.“I am not nervous but I am tense,” said Klopp. “It is a special kind of tense. If something is important to you, you want to reach it. That is why you have the situation of stress but, over the years, you learn how to deal with it and learn that you won’t die because of these situations. I have won and lost many important games but in the last few years it has gone well. Salzburg are going in the right direction.Jesse Marsch, Salzburg’s American coach, was filmed at half-time at Anfield in October berating his team for showing Liverpool too much respect as they fell 3-0 behind and rallied to level at 3-3 before Mohamed Salah sealed victory for the hosts. “Show them we are fucking here to compete,” raged Marsch, who also urged his forwards to be more ruthless against Virgil van Dijk. That is easier said than done.Confidence stems from an unbeaten league campaign – just like their visitors – and free-scoring form that has produced 96 goals in 25 matches in all competitions this season. Haaland, linked with a January move to Manchester United or Borussia Dortmund among many others, has a remarkable 28 goals in 21 appearances.“I’m living the dream,” said the son of former Leeds and Manchester City midfielder Alf-Inge. “Matches like this are what you dream of, so I am enjoying it. I am confident that we will score tomorrow. Liverpool are a fantastic team but Salzburg are also a fantastic team and we create a lot of chances and I am confident we will attack the game.” As for his own future, Haaland insisted: “I’m just focused on my job, playing football. I try to enjoy what I do every day and go in with a clear mindset and enjoy the moment right now. My focus now is on Salzburg and me as a player. It is not hard at all. My father was a former player so he has been helping me.”Klopp described Haaland as a “big, big talent with a wonderful future” but maintains Liverpool will have a plan to stifle the confident teenager.“You defend a good striker by making sure he doesn’t get too many balls,” the Liverpool manager said. “He can dribble but he won’t do it from his own area and beat 10 men. We will try to avoid passes to him, cut him off from the game. We have to make it difficult. Unfortunately he is not the only good player in their team. If they beat us, they deserve to go through. If it doesn’t happen, we do. It’s as simple as that and we have 97 minutes to show that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ada4ab053cf793496595855c9c1abef848cf7d7/0_49_3435_2061/master/3435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f996eb6c0e6d0ab9b6bc33e6e37dbe15","title":"marcus rashford as good as cristiano ronaldo solskjaer","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær has encouraged comparisons between Marcus Rashford and Cristiano Ronaldo and admitted the England forward has the ability to emulate his predecessor at Manchester United.Rashford’s penalty in the victory over Manchester City in Saturday’s derby took him to double figures in the Premier League for only the second time in his career despite more than half of the season remaining. With 16 goals for club and country so far the 22-year-old is enjoying by far his most prolific campaign since breaking into the United first team under Louis van Gaal in 2016, having been utilised mainly off the left flank by Solskjær and the England manager, Gareth Southgate.Asked whether his performances in the victories over Tottenham and City had reminded him of the Juventus and Portugal forward Ronaldo, who scored 118 goals in 292 appearances for United between 2003 and 2009, Solskjær said: “It’s very easy to compare the two of them, yes. Both with skills, body shape, attitude, attributes – everything. The boy has every chance in the world to become a top, top player. Let’s hope he continues like this.”With United already assured of qualification for the last 32 of the Europa League, Rashford is likely to be rested for Thursday’s meeting with AZ Alkmaar at Old Trafford, having racked up 13 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions this season.His pleas on social media for the Premier League to reconsider its decision not to award him a goal in the draw against Aston Villa when his header went in off the goalkeeper Tom Heaton have so far been ignored but Solskjær believes there are still plenty more to come.“I don’t want to talk about the amount of goals,” he said. “As long as he keeps being positive and being direct and thinking about getting in front of the goal and getting chances, he’ll score goals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/044798a402fbd8035d4077aa624d1a8cf6bd2755/83_37_3336_2002/master/3336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61052ce7457a4ff1c98095c7ea008e71","title":"west ham arsenal premier league match report","story":"Rarely can one small step in the right direction have felt so satisfying. At half-time the grim post-mortems were being prepared. Arsenal had been booed off by supporters who were starting to wonder if their team were sliding into a relegation battle and at that stage, with West Ham dominant, it was hard to see a way back.Not so fast, though. Everything changed in the space of nine sensational second-half minutes. Arsenal took their inspiration from an 18-year-old rookie, levelling through Gabriel Martinelli, and that was the cue for Nicolas Pépé to demonstrate why he is worth £72m, conjuring a goal of the highest quality. Freddie Ljungberg’s players had shown their mettle and the interim coach had his first victory since stepping in for Unai Emery.Ljungberg’s selection had the feel of a manager aiming to correct the assumption that he is no more than a supply teacher. He made big calls, dropping Alexandre Lacazette and picking Calum Chambers over David Luiz in central defence, and Arsenal’s starting XI had the look of a power play from the Swede, a message to his underperforming players that he would not tolerate a repeat of Thursday’s abysmal performance against Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion.It was a risky move from Ljungberg and Arsenal, who had to draft in Ainsley Maitland-Niles at right-back after Héctor Bellerín suffered an injury during the warm-up, were there for the taking. Their attempts to play out from the back lacked conviction and there was a timidity about their passing, even though Mesut Özil had freedom to roam in his free role. West Ham sensed vulnerability and the hosts should have taken an early lead when Declan Rice muscled Özil off the ball and combined with Felipe Anderson to free Michail Antonio, who shanked his effort over Bernd Leno’s goal from a promising position.West Ham, tidy on the ball and aggressive when they were hunting it down, did not have to push hard to pierce a rearguard which was further weakened when Kieran Tierney went off with a shoulder injury. They were dangerous whenever Antonio, who tested Leno with a low drive at the end of a powerful run, was bullying the Arsenal back four with his power and it did not come as a shock when they went in front after 38 minutes. Arsenal failed to clear a set piece properly, Pablo Fornals dinked in a cross from the right and Angelo Ogbonna, more assertive than anyone in a yellow shirt, arrived unchallenged to head past Leno with the aid of a deflection off the unfortunate Maitland-Niles.Arsenal could not complain, even though VAR checked to see if Ogbonna had handled. The visitors had offered next to nothing, aside from the moment when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang darted down the left and crossed for Özil to head over from six yards. Martinelli was struggling on his first Premier League start, Pépé was having a mediocre game on the right and Arsenal’s efforts in the first half were best summed up by Granit Xhaka attempting to lift the ball through to Aubameyang and scooping a dismal pass to Ogbonna instead.Ljungberg’s side were booed off by their supporters at half-time. It is never a good sign when the away support grows mutinous and it was less than encouraging when Sokratis Papastathopoulos, attempting to bring the ball out of defence at the start of the second half, ran down a blind alley before knocking the ball out for a throw.West Ham ought to have doubled their lead when Xhaka gifted possession to Robert Snodgrass with an awful pass. Leno was grateful to see Snodgrass’s deflected shot spin wide and Xhaka, looking sheepishly at the floor, breathed a sigh of relief.Yet West Ham paid the price for failing to keep their foot on Arsenal’s throat. Shortly after the hour Arsenal broke down the left and Sead Kolasinac, Tierney’s replacement, found too much to room to slip a low cross into the middle. Rice had fallen asleep and Martinelli, who has offered flashes of youthful promise during his outings in the Europa League and Carabao Cup, calmly sidefooted beyond David Martin.Martinelli’s first goal at this level changed the game and Pépé grew in confidence once he realised that Arthur Masuaku is a much weaker left-back than Aaron Cresswell, who had gone off injured. After 66 minutes the Ivorian cut inside and bent a wonderful shot into the far corner with his left foot.Arsenal, determined to win for the first time in 10 matches, were unrecognisable. Özil came alive, drifting into dangerous positions and finding Aubameyang in space. The forward shuffled the ball on to Pépé, who waited a moment before crossing. Played onside by Ryan Fredericks, Aubameyang beat Martin.By the end it was West Ham, a point above the bottom three, who were feeling the heat. The spotlight had moved off Ljungberg and on to Pellegrini."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d475c2cb1f3d4c2c8803e858e115490aa6facb43/0_136_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45a20c92685776fcc2d3a72879ba75a4","title":"joaquins feat is a hat trick for the ages 19 years in the making","story":"At 38 years and 140 days, the Real Betis forward has become the oldest player to score three in a La Liga matchThey were all there except him, everyone waiting for the old man again. It was six minutes to two, time to go, and in the tunnel at the Benito Villamarín 21 players lined up ready to go out alongside the referee, Valentín Pizarro Gómez, and one of his assistants. Just up the stairs, the other linesman stood by the dressing-room door, flag in one hand, getting a little impatient. “We’re only missing Joaquín,” he called down, “… yeah I know.” Alongside him the Betis manager, Joan Francesc Ferrer ‘Rubi’, wore a look that said what do you want me to do? so the linesman took a step inside. “Come on Joaquín!” he shouted. “Let’s go mate. We’re waiting for you here.” Rubi looked at his watch, then stuck his head round the door, nervous now.The next time he looked it said one minute past two, 01.28 on the screens around the stadium, and the place was going wild. Joaquín had finally left the dressing room, high-fived his manager and, with linesman in tow shouting “come on let’s go”, led them into the sunshine. He had shaken hands with all of Athletic’s players, Betis’s anthem booming round as he went along the line, and posed for a team picture with dozens of kids, many in wheelchairs. He had chosen ends, Iñaki Williams calling wrong, stood head bowed in silence in honour of former player Francisco Aparicio, and belted the ball into the net. He had been out only seven minutes, touched the ball only twice, and hadn’t even been playing 90 seconds, but he had already scored.Nine minutes and three seconds later, he had scored again. And nine minutes and 19 seconds after that, he had scored another.It had taken 19 minutes. Nineteen minutes and 19 years, which made it all the more special.And that was just the start, each stat sillier than the last, leaving you to choose which you liked best. “My daughters didn’t stop crying: they’re not used to seeing their dad score goals. They said: ‘Hey Dad, how cool that you scored three goals I didn’t think you’d ever do that,’” Joaquín admitted later. “And I said: ‘Nor did I.’” He arrived on 100 goals, averaging just over one every eight games across his career and he had never scored a hat-trick, not even at youth level. The Benito Villamarín had not seen any of their players score a hat-trick since Finidi George, 22 years earlier. And only six players had scored a hat-trick inside 20 minutes for anyone, anywhere. But now he’d gone and blown away all those records in the blink of an eye.Yet if it was fast, it was also slow: it had taken Joaquín until he was 38 years and 140 days old to get a hat-trick, long after most have retired. On Sunday he was the oldest man on the pitch – and that includes the referee – and became the oldest player to score three in a La Liga match, overtaking Alfredo Di Stéfano at 37 years 255 days in 1964. This is his 20th senior season he has scored in all of them.The day Joaquín made his first-team debut, at the start of 2000-01, the Betis captain Juan Merino hid his boots. “One day you’ll have to clean them,” Joaquín told him. Today, Merino would have to join a queue. Joaquín won the Copa del Rey, one of only three trophies in the club’s history, posing with the trophy wearing nothing at all and then placing it at the altar when he got married a few days later. Back then, most expected him to be a superstar somewhere. When it was suggested that his dad was off negotiating a move away Joaquín replied: “Nah, he’s on the sofa at home with his arse hanging out the back of his trousers as usual.” Mourinho’s Chelsea came. And he was the galáctico that never was, Florentino Pérez making a show of publicly courting him. But in the end he joined Valencia after six seasons at home – not least because Betis needed him to.The 36 players on trial in Spain\u0027s most high-profile match-fixing case were cleared of wrongdoing on Monday. A Spanish judge issued the not guilty verdict, saying there was not enough evidence to convict the players and others on trial.More than 40 people were accused of match-fixing involving the La Liga game between Levante and Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season. Two former Zaragoza officials convicted of fraud: the former president Agapito Iglesias and club director Javier Porquera. Both men were given one-year, three-month prison sentences that are likely to be suspended.The accused players were facing two years in prison and a six-year soccer ban, but will now not face any further action. The charges related to a €965,000 (£812,000) payment to Zaragoza\u0027s squad before their 2-1 win over Levante, which secured survival and relegated Deportivo La Coruña.Prosecutors claimed there was evidence that the money had been transferred to Levante players, but the judge ruled there was no evidence this had occurred. Former Zaragoza officials said the money was paid to motivate the club\u0027s players, not to fix the result.He went to Málaga and Fiorentina, then he came back again. He was 34 he’d be lucky to have a season ahead of him, most thought. That was four and a half years ago now, and there will be more. Betis are expected to announce a new contract soon, taking him beyond his 40th birthday, Joaquín joking on Sunday night that he could turn the screw a little bit now. Not that it is just the hat-trick it is the three games in a row he has scored, the role played both on and off the pitch in pulling Betis away from the relegation zone and their manager away from the sack, the way he is playing. It is 12 years since Joaquín was in the Spain squad – the country’s best player at the 2002 World Cup, the kid who least deserved to miss in that shootout against South Korea – but it might not be so daft to suggest he would fit in again now. In the past couple of years, he has actually got better.When Lionel Messi said the words that couldn’t be unsaid last week, depressing everyone when he admitted, at 32, that retirement is close, Joaquín noted: “Well, he hasn’t got my physique, has he?” He was joking but there was something in it, something that expressed hope for everyone, maybe even Messi. His dad reckons he is so strong because he was breast fed until he was seven. And yet it’s psychological too, enthusiasm renewed over the past couple of years. Derby wins followed with Setien, a new style that suited him: after one, in which he scored the winner, he said could leave football “a happy man”, but staying made him even happier man, and that’s the key.The day after Messi scored his 35th league hat-trick – more than anyone else ever – Joaquin scored his first – later than anyone else ever. This was something to celebrate, for all of us. Joaquín put out a video saying he was exhausted and staying at home, only to crack up and giggle: “No one believes that for a minute,” announcing: “I’m off out for a wee drink.” Meanwhile, his feat was splashed across every front page. “Superhero”, “Joaquín performs magic”, “Monumental”, ran the three headlines in Diario de Sevilla alone.What he had done was a reminder of the power of enjoyment, further evidence that a grin isn’t a handicap and a joke isn’t a crime, still unprofessionalism that scowling seriousness is not the only route to success, and happiness helps. Everyone’s favourite cheeky scamp, more famous for his gags than his goals, Joaquín isn’t just a comedian, he is also a competitor he’s not still playing because he’s funny, but he may well still be playing because it’s fun, another way of clinging to your childhood. “I have kids of 19 and one of 38 in my team,” Rubi said. Emerson, who provided the assist for the first, was one the day Joaquín made his first-team debut. Diego Laínez, playing alongside him, was two months old. Loren Moron made the third. His dad played against Joaquín, now he plays with him, just like Sergio Canales. “Granddad,” Canales wrote on the ball, “it’s an honour to play with you.”“The dickhead,” Joaquín laughed as he read it out on the radio.“If I had known how much hassle there would be, I wouldn’t have done it,” Joaquín joked on Sunday night. He might even have scored more, the clock showing 90.57 when he raced into the area and drew a sharp save from Unai Simón. “I was as stiff as dried cod: if I’d stopped to control it, I’d have fallen over,” he said. Besides, three was just enough. Athletic pulled two back but Betis had won again – that’s three in a row now, a single defeat in six, Europe in sight instead of relegation – and standing pitchside at the end the ball under his arm, Joaquín was beaming, barely able to believe it. “This was my first hat-trick and I think it’ll be my last,” he said. Back in the dressing room, everyone was waiting for him again. When at last he arrived, they got to their feet and gave him a standing ovation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dcefc6e0fc0c7116e073f2f24f1036ff94f3e7f/415_0_3174_1904/master/3174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=912fac4b168aa299a1ae5ccc3f714a83","title":"west ham united v arsenal premier league live","story":"Arsenal snapped out of a funk to blow West Ham away with a nine-minute, three-goal salvo.That’s your lot, then, folks. Thanks for reading this MBM!Manuel Pellegrini’s version. “It was difficult to understand. We dominated the game for 60 minutes, and then we lost the game. Maybe we should have scored the second goal, it was so important. You must understand the boos, because in the last five games here we did not win. Of course we try to do it. I think we were the better team than Arsenal for 60 minutes, but fans cannot be happy. You cannot concede three goals in every game. Maybe we are not in our best moment, but we will continue fighting. I can fix it.” He’s then pressed by Sky on whether he’ll be given the chance to do so. “It does not depend on me,” is his sharp response, at which point he walks off.An extremely satisfied Freddie Ljungberg talks to Sky. “It means so much for the players, they have been living under enormous pressure for the last couple of weeks. We’ve seen that in their performances. But we believe in how we want to play football, and I could see around the hour mark that West Ham were starting to tire. We played it a bit crisper, a bit faster, and all of a sudden we sliced them open. The boys were amazing. They stepped up, quicker passing. You need to work hard, in attack and defence, and they did that today. It’s down to the players, I’m just there to guide them a little bit. We still have a lot to work on. We enjoy tonight and start working again tomorrow.”Our man Jacob Steinberg was at the London Stadium to witness that turnaround. Here’s his report.Arsenal celebrate a deserved win - eventually deserved - with wide smiles, backslaps and hugs. Freddie Ljungberg in the middle of it all. And no wonder, they’re back in the top half of the table, in ninth with 22 points, just two behind fifth-placed Manchester United. West Ham however remain in trouble, stuck in 16th place after taking 16 points from 16 games. They’re just one point above the dropzone, having lost seven of their last nine. Their next game is at Southampton on Saturday evening Saints will leapfrog them if they win.Arsenal were awful for the first 59 minutes, then sensational for the following nine. Their three-goal second-half blast has lifted the mood around the club, while heaping further pressure on Manuel Pellegrini, who has the boos of the few Hammers fans left in the stadium ringing in his ears.90 min +5: “We are staying up!” chant some self-deprecating Arsenal supporters. Or are they merely baiting the remaining West Ham fans? It could be either or both, couldn’t it.90 min +4: Aubameyang dribbles down the inside left, checks back, makes space to shoot near the penalty spot, and watches his effort ping off the heel of Fredericks and over the bar. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. “Freddie deserves some big props for this turnaround,” writes Adrian Caddy. “We’d been crying out for Emery to pick a front three with Aubameyang in his best position flanked by Pepe and Martinelli. All three have delivered.”90 min +2: Arsenal ping it around, and their fans entertain themselves with some repetitive whoops of joy.90 min: Holland curls one into the Arsenal box from the right. It’s an inviting cross, and Chambers does very well to get in ahead of Haller. He takes a whack for his troubles. As he rolls around, it’s announced there will be seven added minutes.88 min: More seats flipping up in the stands. It’s the remaining Arsenal fans making all the noise. Pepe is replaced by Reiss Nelson, and receives both a warm ovation from his fans and a hug and a huge smile from Freddie Ljungberg.86 min: Matteo Guendouzi comes on in his place. “After the dismal performance in the first half I must confess that I was preparing a very snarky note to send out to slag the Gunners,” admits Mary Waltz. “I still have low expectations for Arsenal’s remainder of this season but for today they deserve an apology and a tip of the hat from me.”85 min: Xhaka falls to the turf again, still dizzy, and he’s going to have to go off. He walks off with a wry smile.83 min: Noble must have been taking notes from Xhaka earlier, because he plays a dismal hospital ball infield from the right, allowing Pepe to tear upfield with great intent. The West Ham captain is fortunate that Pepe’s control lets him down as he enters the area, allowing Balbuena to recover.82 min: Masuaku makes ground down the left and wedges a cute cross into the mixer, but Sokratis is on hand to clear, winning the battle with Antonio and Haller.80 min: Xhaka is good to continue. Quite a few seats are now flipped up, plenty of West Ham fans having seen enough.79 min: Xhaka takes a Masuaku crossfield pass flush in the grid. He’s flat on his back. The trainer comes on to run the rule over him. While we wait, Nathan Holland comes on for Robert Snodgrass. 77 min: Pepe nutmegs Masuaku and enters the box on the right. Pepe goes over Masuaku’s leg, claiming a penalty. He was looking for it, and doesn’t get it.75 min: Speaking of Brazilians, Martinelli looks the real deal. He powers his way down the inside-right channel, winning a ball he really had no right to earn, and spins to set up Torreira, just inside the box. Torreira gives the ball a good old whack, and his effort is well blocked by Balbuena.73 min: West Ham can’t get the ball. Arsenal were barely capable of stringing two passes together for the first hour. Now they’re stroking it around with the insouciant arrogance of Brazil during the last ten minutes of the 1970 World Cup final.71 min: That nine-minute, three-goal Arsenal salvo has stunned West Ham. It could be the end of Manuel Pellegrini. Sebastian Heller comes on for Filipe Anderson. Will that substitution turn out to be one of the manager’s last decisions as West Ham boss?The scoring’s not over. Aubameyang backheels a pass down the right, releasing Pepe into a little bit of grass. Pepe checks and chips a delicate cross back towards the striker, who had kept moving. Aubameyang bicycle kicks into the bottom right. Martin got a hand on the shot, but couldn’t keep it out.68 min: Filipe Anderson dribbles down the left and loops a cross towards Fornals, who, falling backwards, can’t keep his header, intended for the top right, down. A real sense that the scoring isn’t over.Arsenal were a complete shambles less than ten minutes ago. Now they’re in the lead, and scoring magical goals! Aubameyang slips a pass wide right for Pepe, who shuffles into the box, makes a little bit of space away from Masuaku, and curls an unstoppable shot across Martin and into the top left! The keeper had absolutely no chance with that.65 min: Balbuena tears down the right, reaches the end of the road and stands one up into the box. Antonio goes over, unable to connect with his head. The West Ham fans want a penalty, but Antonio makes no claim whatsoever.63 min: That’s really rattled West Ham, who are struggling to clear their lines all of a sudden. Ozil plays a cute right-to-left chip for Martinelli, who can’t quite sort his feet out just inside the area. Had he managed it, he’d have been one on one with Martin.62 min: That was such a lovely, incisive move, and what a finish by Martinelli! That came out of nowhere, and suddenly the Gunners are pinging the ball around in a very pretty fashion. What a strange game football can be.Pulitzer, please! So having said Arsenal were doing nothing, they suddenly spring into life! Torreira slips a pass down the left for Kolasinac to stride onto. Kolasinac enters the box and pulls back for Martinelli, the young man slamming a glorious first-time shot into the bottom right!58 min: Arsenal are playing with an almost total lack of confidence. Aubameyang tears down the right and, upon reaching the byline, larrups a dismal cross miles into the sky and out of play on the other wing. The home fans enjoyed that very much.57 min: Snodgrass causes trouble down the right and cuts back for Rice, who shapes a lovely hard sidefoot towards the bottom right from 20 yards. Leno does extremely well to keep hold of the ball. Rice really struck that, it was a proper whistler.55 min: Xhaka plays a useless blind pass in from the right to nobody. That allows Snodgrass to zip down the inside-right channel and take a shot that clips off Kolasinac and loops over Leno, nearly dropping into the bottom left. Instead it’s a corner, and Xhaka repairs the damage, sort of, by jumping into a challenge for a high ball backwards, and somehow winning a goal kick. Xhaka really is very entertaining to watch, although I appreciate his unique appeal will be selective.53 min: Martinelli earns a corner with a determined run down the inside-right channel. Meeting the set piece, Torreira blooters over from an overly ambitious range. Here’s Dean Kinsella: “I’ve been watching top flight English football since Bertie Mee was the Arsenal manager and I’m pretty sure that was the worst half of a game I’ve seen them play in all those 50 or so years. And West Ham were only marginally better by dint of at least trying to play.”52 min: A minute of the warmest applause for West Ham fan Peter Taylor, who recently passed away.51 min: Nope, he can’t go on. He limps off, to be replaced by Arthur Masuaku. Ozil then takes the free kick, just to the right of the box. It’s easily slapped clear by Ogbonna. A very poor delivery.49 min: Pepe drops a shoulder to trick Cresswell, who looks like he’s tweaked something and doesn’t fancy a footrace down the right. So the full-back clatters the winger. Booked. But before any free kick can be taken, the West Ham physio comes on to check if Cresswell can continue.47 min: Snodgrass gets West Ham on the front foot early doors. He takes the set piece himself. Rice can’t get a header on target. The ball breaks to Noble, who lifts a wild shot miles over the bar. Aubameyang makes his way back upfield holding his head, looking a little woozy. Xhaka checks he’s good to continue. The striker says he’s fine, though he doesn’t look particularly happy.Right, back to the big game ... and West Ham get the ball rolling for the second half.They can’t get it, but trot off down the tunnel looking fairly content. They’re 45 minutes away from a confidence-restoring win. Arsenal by contrast look miserable they’ve been a lightweight non-event. “You know how we always used to get irritated by the ‘hey guys, remember Spangles?’ crowd who would forever be banging on about irrelevant minutiae from the 70s?” asks Tom Atkins, in the rhetorical style. “You always become the thing you hate the most. That said, Villa is Mita Copiers, Man City always Brother, and Ipswich obviously Fisons. I also think we need an adjudication on Crown Paints vs Candy for Liverpool.”45 min +3: It’s all West Ham, who are pressing for a second goal that would put the visitors in all sorts of bother.45 min +1: There will be five additional minutes, Tierney’s injury, VAR, all that. The first sees Aubameyang welt a shot miles over the bar from a very ambitious distance. Arsenal haven’t worked Martin at all.45 min: Snodgrass is blocked off by Kolasinac as he dribbles down the right. He wants a penalty, but he’s not getting it. It all looked a bit theatrical as he fell backwards, his spine arcing in the dramatic style.44 min: A bit of space for Pepe, who has been Arsenal’s liveliest player, despite Cresswell’s attention. He makes good down the right and crosses low. Martin, who hasn’t had much to do, gathers confidently.42 min: Torreira attempts a back-heel a couple of yards from his own box. He nearly lets Antonio in on goal, but gets away with it. That was ludicrous, and it’s no wonder Arsenal are shipping goals like they’re going out of fashion.40 min: This is preposterous. VAR takes nearly two minutes to work out whether Ogbonna had headed the ball onto his outstretched fist, en route to the goal via Maitland-Niles’ back. It was nowhere near, but it took them about 200 replays to decide. Anyway, it’s all good. Whither spontaneous joy?Cresswell wins a corner down the left. He hoicks it long. Some pinball. Noble takes a whack. More pinball. Rice flicks the ball towards Fornals, to the right of the six-yard box. He dinks it back in. Ogbonna wants it the most, and his desire wins out. His header, towards the top left, twangs off Maitland-Niles’ back and into the top right, past the wrong-footed Leno."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27acaf5f19f0b33c70c8e76ec646facc2768f6e3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f270344b6de30328df0a6dce4dc8ae","title":"hymen virginity tests us ti","story":"In the US, it is still perfectly legal to doctors to perform ‘hymen checks’ as proof of virginityMichelle Northcote doesn’t remember her paediatrician’s face, but she does remember the ceiling in his office. It was covered with large tiles probably made of foam or cork-board. Each tile was large and rectangular, an off-white color flecked with grey.From the age of six to 13, Northcote spent a long time staring at it. Once a year, for the longest two minutes in history, she would force herself to concentrate on those tiles right after her doctor repeated the familiar phrase:“And now, I have to check your hymen.”Northcote, a New Yorker, recalls the check being “like an awkward fingering”. She never really knew why it happened – her doctor never told her. She never even realized it wasn’t normal until a discussion with university friends years later. The look on their faces said everything when she shared her story – she immediately knew it shouldn’t have happened.At first she assumed her doctor must have been a pervert. And then, after rapper TI disclosed last month that he forces his daughter to have her hymen checked every year to prove that she is a virgin, Northcote had to reconsider those visits and what they meant. “I realized that my mother must have been asking for them, to see if I was a virgin,” says Northcote. She doesn’t know for sure – the relationship between the two is incredibly strained. But as a strictly conservative catholic who was obsessed with virginity, it seems about right.Her mother’s obsession with her virginity started when she was six, and continued until she was a teenager. One night, she dragged Northcote out of bed in the middle of the night to ask if she was having sex. She was so obsessed with her daughter having sex with men that she didn’t even realize that her daughter was in fact a lesbian.Despite years of research dispelling the long-held myth surrounding the hymen – that it breaks after a woman’s first vaginal penetration – its power pertains.Its power remains even after a study from 1906 showed that a sex-worker’s hymen was still intact – which should have been enough to dispel the myth. So too, should have been a 2004 study, which studied 36 pregnant women, 34 of which still had an intact hymen. Still, the myth is so compelling that people would rather believe in virgin pregnancies than facts. The hymen, a fold of membrane at the vaginal opening, varies dramatically from woman to woman. In some women the hymen looks like a ring, in others it is crescent shaped. Some women have several holes, notches or clefts in their hymens, others have no hymen at all.In a TED talk called the virginity fraud, doctors Nina Dølvik Brochmann and Ellen Støkken Dahl describe how the hymen is more like a scrunchie than a hole: “It’s very elastic – for a lot of women, elastic enough to handle vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.” For many women, it doesn’t break during sex. Its perforation is no sign of sexual activity, and the accompanying assumption that comes alongside it – that a virginal woman will bleed the first time she has sex – is little more than folklore.And yet, every year, women undergo surgery to “restore” their hymens. Tens of thousands of women also order fake hymen kits every year – thousands of which are in the US. The fake hymen is placed in the vagina before intercourse and spurts blood during the act. One company, HymenShop, told the  it sells the most kits in California and North Carolina.Another Germany-based company, VirginiaCare, told the  it sells thousands of kits across the US every year. Many of their customers, they say, call saying they need the fake hymen to protect themselves. Sometimes the women are virgins but want to make sure they bleed on their wedding night, fearing repercussions. Often, their partners know they plan to use the fake blood, but hitch a plan to deceive parents, who check their bedsheets after their wedding nights.“A lot of girls tell us ‘My husband knows I’m going to use it – but we just need to be sure that there will be blood on the sheets after the wedding night’,” said Daniela Lindeman, a VirginiaCare spokesperson.The company knows that neither blood nor a hymen are indicative of a woman’s virginity, but feel no moral obligation not to produce the product. Lindeman says that it’s not the hymen kit that perpetuates the myth – it’s that fact that people want to believe it.“You will never get this out of their heads. That’s why the myth has been around for 2,000 years, that you need to be a virgin, and that you have to confirm it in this way,” she said.Asked whether they feel a responsibility not to perpetuate lies, Lindeman says that they are providing a service: “We are just trying to help in any way and care about these girls or women. In the end, we are also saving their lives,” she said.•••Dr Jennifer Gunter, a gynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible, says that “the patriarchy is invested in women holding women to biological standards that are impossible.”That very system, she argues, ensures that women who are raped are not heard (hymen checks were, and still are, performed to determine sexual assault and rape) to mark a woman out as a man’s property, and to keep women in fear of enjoying sex.“A woman who has blood stained sheets on her wedding night has sexual trauma. But this culture implies that, as long as a woman is traumatized during her first sexual experience, then that satisfies some sort of ritual,” says Gunter, adding:“It is so offensive. On a human level, and on a biological level.”A systematic review on hymen checks summed up the incredibly harmful impacts of the practice. In one case, an examinee had her arms broken after she “failed” a test. In another case, the test resulted in suicide. Women scream, cry and faint during the tests, and reported self-hatred and loss of self-esteem following them.The fear of it alone can have disastrous consequences.Ashley Lee, 20, from Missouri, was threatened with a hymen check by her parents almost every year before she left home. It was a particular source of terror for her because she had been sexually abused by her brother’s friend when she was young.“I worried I was going to get in trouble for something that wasn’t my fault. I felt like there’d be no one there to help me, like I’d be shamed what happened to me,” she said during a phone interview. “It made me feel like it was my fault.”In an incredible cruel twist to the story, her parents knew about the abuse, and yet continued to hang the test over her head to make sure she never felt comfortable enough to have sex under their roof.“They told me that a doctor would check my vagina and push on parts of my uterus to figure out whether I had sex or not. It terrified me,” says Lee.It was enough to make her leave home aged 16, but the threat had long-lasting impacts. Perhaps contrary to what her parents intended, it made her value her body less, not more: “It made me feel like what’s between my legs is what makes me who I am, that it was my worth,” says Lee.Medicine is a profession as vulnerable to dogma as any – particularly because of the lasting impact that outdated medical texts and a body of research that has historically focused on older white men continues to have. As Gunter puts it: “Some dude writes something in a textbook in the 1920s and its like, goddamnit – it sticks! You have a really hard time undoing it.”For the medical culture to change, something else needs to go first: sexism. “You have to remember doctors are part of society – they are all subject to prejudices and religious beliefs just like normal people are subject to,” Gunter says. To put it bluntly: a medical degree is no guarantee against one doctor’s ignorance.When Gunter was in medical school, the hymen – let alone the social constructs around virginity that surrounded it – was barely spoken about. When it was, it was from a male perspective. Female doctors, surrounded by men and the same “purity principles”, felt uncomfortable setting the record straight: “They’d teach that it hurts the first time women have sex, that you bleed. I’d be thinking – that’s not how I felt – but you couldn’t say that. Until recently, talking about the vagina and sex, it was just not done,” she says.At present, it is not considered medical malpractice to perform a hymen examination – in fact, it’s completely legal. But one New York assemblywoman is hoping to make a tangible difference by changing the law.Michaelle Solages’s bill hopes to take the question completely out of a doctor’s hands. If passed, it will ensure that virginity testing is banned that any medical professional undertaking such a practice will face losing their license and that if the examination is performed in the US, whether inside or outside the medical office, it should be constituted as sexual assault.“This is an aggressive piece of legislation because as a modern society, we can’t stand for this abuse. And that’s what it is, abuse,” says Solages in a phone interview. She argues that the power that a doctor has over their patients, plus the fact that the examination is not fit for purpose, is proof that the procedure is abusive. The bill can’t be heard until at least January, when the house is back in legislative session, but Solages says interest in the bill has been huge. Both Gunter and Solages hope that having more women around the table will mean real change. But in the meantime, there is a glaring double standard: there are no virginity tests for men. While Northcote and Lee were both brought up by parents invested in chastity, their brothers were never held to the same virginity standard.Moreover, rather than encouraging women to be fierce protectors of their own bodies, “virginity testing” put them in harm’s way when it came to later sexual violence.“I just always had this example, that people will take advantage of you if they can. Even if they are people who are meant to protect you, they don’t,” said Northcote. For Lee, it took years for her to even begin to consider herself as a valuable human being. “It encourages this mindset that it’s OK for someone to control you, you can’t make your own choices because it’s all already decided for you,” she said.Asked what she would tell parents who consider asking for the test today, she says: “I would say please, just do your research. You really don’t know that you might be ruining this child’s life instead of protecting them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2a541caf08553be8fe04418f5d4569604e275af/0_592_2934_1760/master/2934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4589eb6a3badb94051b9def139856bab","title":"we married in secret five weeks after meeting it was young love and lust and id do it again","story":"Laura and Jay Anderson were 18 and 20 when they met as students in the early 90s. They now live in Minnesota with their two children and three dogsIt was January 1992 when Jay spotted Laura in a bar in Washington DC. “I was on a date with someone else, but it was clear there was nothing there for either of us,” Jay recalls. The bar was busy, so he and his date began chatting to other people. “I thought Laura was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen. I had to speak to her.”The pair discovered they were both students at local universities and quickly hit it off. “I’d never seen such a well-dressed college kid,” says Laura. “He had lovely manners and seemed very grown-up for his age.” At the end of the night, she gave him her number but he lost it. “I remembered the prefix of the number for the building she lived in, so I called about 50 people until I found her.”Over the next few weeks, he took Laura to some of the city’s nicest bars and restaurants. Then he invited her for a homecooked Valentine’s Day meal. “I’ve no idea how, but the discussion turned to marriage,” says Laura. “It sounds insane, because we were only 18 and 20 and we barely knew each other, but we just decided it was a great idea.” Ten days later, they drove down to Virginia to get married, without telling their families. “We didn’t think it through at all,” says Jay. “Even on the drive down we were both thinking how mad it was. It was young love and lust. We just went for it.”A few months later, the couple confessed their secret to their families. “My parents were really upset. My dad has always wanted to walk me down the aisle,” says Laura. “My family were a bit more accepting,” Jay says, “but Laura’s really struggled. We have a good relationship now but I completely understand why they were so angry.”Although many rushed weddings end in tears, Jay and Laura were determined to work through any teething problems. “At the beginning, we had nothing. No money, no home. It was tough,” he says.The couple moved to Philadelphia after they married, where Laura completed her college degree. In 1995, they went to Georgia for two years, where Jay studied, before they both moved Minneapolis-Saint Paul in Minnesota, where they still live. “Luckily we found out we did actually like each other,” Jay laughs. “We were so young we didn’t care about the material stuff. We just built a life together.”Jay now runs a printing business, while Laura works in a wellness clinic. They “love the outdoors and share an interest in politics,” says Jay. Once every four years they travel to Iowa to check out the presidential candidates.They waited 10 years before having children. “We decided we wanted to spend some time building our relationship first,” says Laura. Their two boys are now 17 and 16 and they have three rescue dogs.“I’ve grown up with Laura,” says Jay. “She’s the most well-meaning person in the world and she makes me want to be a better person. She still has this air of mystery about her, too, even now.”Laura laughs. Jay calls her “part of my DNA”.They have no regrets about marrying so quickly. “When I tell people our story, they say: ‘That’s crazy,’” says Laura. “I mean, I probably spend more time choosing a purse now. But it worked out.” Jay says he would make the same decision in a heartbeat. “In hindsight we rushed things a bit, but now she’s my best friend and the mother of my children. I’d do it all over again every time.”• Want to share your story?

It is not.After videos of the Juice musician’s outfit went viral last night, people paid their respects on Twitter: it seems multiple children had their innocence stolen at the game. Lizzo, dancing happily on the Jumbotron mm-hming at Karl Towns, apparently did not realize she was at a family game.While the language of the outrage focuses on moral decency, theRikishi jokes, the photos circulating comparing Lizzo to Jabba the Hutt, the countless memes of grimacing children and the “just why” commentary all seem to be another question: does she not realize how fat she is?Lizzo does realize she just doesn’t see being fat as an insult. “When I’m looking at my body and I’m shaming every little thing about it… I have to find love in those things. And I think that is why I’m able to call myself fat,” she said in an interview with CBS this year.Some argue that this is nothing to do with Lizzo’s size: an ill-advised outfit is ill-advised on anyone, fat or not. Those people would be well advised to consider that when Nicki Minaj wore a bondage outfit to a Lakers game in 2018, people barely bat an eyelid. Nor was the same disdain afforded to Rhianna after she attended a Raptors game in a see-through shirt and no bra. If RiRi pushes fashion to its limits, after all, it’s a statement to be celebrated. But when Lizzo dares to push the envelope, the discourse takes a whole different slant infused with fat-shaming.And when the cheerleaders do it? Oh, that’s just sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa22653aa4c2813613611c50d0e63c188a8f552/0_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cfa7762f75beec1a808b0a574bb253","title":"election 2019 inside momentum podcast","story":"Anushka Asthana reports from inside Momentum, the grassroots movement hoping to propel Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street.

The Conservatives are on course for an overall majority in parliament – but most voters will back parties that want to block an early Brexit. If turnout is similar to last time, the 14 to 15 million who will support the Conservatives or Brexit party will be outnumbered by the 16 to 17 million who will vote Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green, SNP or Plaid Cymru.Tactical voting is not new, but it has a special significance this week. If it happens in enough constituencies, it can ensure that the two-million majority opposed to Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan is reflected in the new House of Commons.The map below shows 50 seats where tactical voting could keep the Conservatives out. Most tactical voting websites draw on one or two sets of polling data, which risk ignoring the specific circumstances of inidual constituencies. The guide draws on a wider range of information – detailed big-sample national polls, but also constituency surveys (including those reported week by week in the Observer), past election results and local activity, such as the recent student registration drives in some key seats (one is Brunel University, in Johnson’s own constituency, Uxbridge).However, without tactical voting, these three seats – like many others – may well return pro-Brexit MPs, despite having clear Remain majorities, because of the way the anti-Conservative vote ides.It should be stressed that there are many other marginals where Labour is the clear challenger to the Conservatives, but in almost all of these seats the Lib Dems are out of the running. There is little need here for a tactical guide to recommend Labour.In general, where the incumbent MP is Labour, they are the best placed to keep out the Tories. There are four exceptions: two in Scotland and one each in England and Wales. Here, without tactical support for the best-placed non-Labour candidate, Conservative gains are a real possibility. However, in two three-way marginals, Labour needs to win over local supporters of the Lib Dems (Portsmouth South) and Plaid Cymru (Ynys Môn) to be sure of defeating the Conservatives.Scotland presents a specific challenge. A number of traditional Labour strongholds went SNP in 2015 and then Conservative in 2017. In these – as well as Gordon, a former Lib Dem seat, and Moray, once an SNP bastion – the SNP are now best placed to see off the Conservatives.Peter Kellner is a polling expert and former president of YouGovSCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE SEATS VULNERABLE TO THE SNP1 Aberdeen SouthA Labour seat until 2015, the SNP now has the best chance of overturning a Conservative majority of almost 5,000 VOTE SNP2 AngusThe SNP needs to squeeze the Labour vote to regain one of its former strongholds VOTE SNP3 Ayr, Carrick and CumnockThree-way contest in 2017, with Labour now in third place VOTE SNP4 Banff and BuchanThe SNP’s Paul Robertson needs to squeeze both Labour and Lib Dem support to overturn a Tory majority of almost 4,000 VOTE SNP5 Dumfries and GallowayOne-time Labour seat won by the SNP in 2015 and the Tories in 2017.

And the prime minister replied: “I’m going to get Brexit done.” Wow. I feel like I know how this fairytale ends. Guest vocals by the late great Kirsty MacColl.Yet even by his own standards of thermonuclear disingenuity, Johnson’s turn on ITV news on Monday morning reached new depths. In a fish market in Grimsby, ITV News reporter Joe Pike asked Johnson about newspaper reports featuring Jack Williment-Barr, a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia, who was pictured being forced to sleep on a concrete floor in an overcrowded NHS hospital this weekend. “I haven’t had a chance to look at the photo,” Johnson said. Look at it now, said Pike, who had it up on his phone. At which point Johnson simply took the reporter’s phone and stuffed it in his pocket.What has happened to reality? What can you say? Other than: may all would-be statesmen disport themselves with the casual larceny of a guy who knows if you don’t let the legal papers physically touch you, then they haven’t been served on you. For my money, the inclusion of the auto-satirical words “prime minister” at the end of Pike’s next sentence mark it out as a contender for quote of the campaign. Let’s see them in action: “You refuse to look at the photo, you’ve taken my phone, and put it in your pocket, prime minister.” YOU’VE ROBBED HIS PHONE LIVE ON AIR. Sorry – you’ve robbed his phone live on air, prime minister.A pause. “Sorry,” said the prime minister of the United Kingdom, eventually, fumbling around in his pocket for another man’s phone and some more lies. “I’m sorry to have taken your phone, but there you go,” blustered Johnson. “I was just …” But he couldn’t finish the sentence. How on earth could he have finished the sentence? He simply tailed off. Later, at a Q\u0026ampA in a Sunderland factory, Johnson appeared to float scrapping the BBC licence fee simply to distract from this story – a move that vaguely reminded me of Bill Clinton bombing the Sudanese aspirin factory to distract from his blowjob hearings. As Johnson put it: “I’m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof.” Incorrect. You’re under pressure because you nicked a phone live on telly.When she was through the looking glass, the White Queen famously told Alice that “sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things by breakfast”. No offence to Her Majesty, but this is an incredibly low score if you’ve been listening to Boris Johnson’s early morning media round.That said, the PM’s breakfast interview with Nick Ferrari on LBC on Monday gave us a little insight into his process – kind of like an episode of Inside the Liar’s Studio. The prime minister allowed lucky listeners a real-time chance to see how he turns in some of his more memorable mendacious performances. Take the other sort of lying – lying on the floor in front of bulldozers, which he’d once promised to do if Heathrow went ahead with a third runway, but which now appears in direct opposition to government policy.Is he going to do it? wondered Ferrari, rhetorically. “I would … have to find some way of honouring that promise,” mused Johnson, like one of those pundits who promise to eat their shoe live on air if something doesn’t happen, then are proved wrong, but eat a shoe made out of cake and imagine they’re quits. Like this, but with his entire climate morality. “It might be technically difficult to achieve,” Johnson continued, ostensibly talking about the bulldozers, but subconsciously surely weighing up the technical challenges of the lie. This would be a 4 ½ reverse ferret, in the pike position, with 2 ½ twists. Technically difficult to achieve – near-impossible to guarantee a perfect 10 from the Russian judge – yet somehow entirely doable for this most tireless of all competitors.Even when not actively advancing one of his own lies, Johnson has developed a new tic of lying that he doesn’t understand his interviewer’s questions. “I don’t know what you mean by breaking a red wall,” he lied to Ferrari about a term that has been bandied about by his Tory strategists the entire campaign. It was the same last week when people were asking him questions about the film of him taking the piss out of Donald Trump with some other Nato leaders. “I really don’t know what is being referred to,” he lied then. “I don’t know where that’s come from.” The prime minister remains a man whose deep personal philosophy can be summed up by the video for Shaggy’s It Wasn’t Me.His other stylistic trait has been linking two things that have precisely no bearing on the other. Asked by Ferrari about Jack Williment-Barr, Johnson appeared to suggest that the real illness is Britain’s political constipation. Not having Brexit is “blocking things”, he explained. “Once we’ve got things motoring,” he suggested, situations like a small child being treated on a floor would no longer occur, “but that can only happen when we’ve got Brexit done.” Hang on, what? Why? What in the name of logic, never mind empathy, are you talking about? We expect sociopathy, but at least lace it with basic coherence.Then again, we have reached the stage of the campaign where Johnson’s words feel terminally unmoored from reality. Take his Grimsby visit, where he offered fishermen “the chance to recapture some of that spectacular marine wealth” – a way of putting it that makes one of the country’s most hardscrabble industries sound easily as rewarding as running a hedge fund. Follow Johnson, even if it goes against your instincts, and he will make you fishers of men. Which is to say that you’ll be retraining as cold callers if you currently fish sustainably, then he ends up going for no-deal and you lose paper-free access to the single market. And that’s if he hasn’t had your phone off you, preventing you from even making the calls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/379f5b04854342d107f2f23180fb80b5f8f761c9/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c09a8f1d00bacd4c421a3829338f13c2","title":"corbyn plays all the old favourites in bristol but no ones dancing","story":"A late arrival by Labour’s leader at a west country rally added to the sense of hopelessnessIt wasn’t exactly Woodstock. It wasn’t even Birmingham 2017. Back then nearly 10,000 people had turned up to hear Clean Bandit and Steve Coogan appear as warm-up acts for Jeremy Corbyn in the final days of the election campaign. On College Green in Bristol, sandwiched between the cathedral and the town hall, barely a couple of thousand – mostly students – showed up for the start of the Labour leader’s series of whirlwind national rallies.Corbyn had hoped Bristol might mark the first gig of The Comeback Tour. It felt more like The Long Goodbye. It wasn’t just the audience and the warmth of a summer’s evening that were missing. It was the energy and the enthusiasm. Two years ago, there had been a sense of hope. A feeling that change was possible. Now there was just weariness, a weight of resignation. A commitment to a cause that already felt lost. The crowd had turned up as much to keep the faith with themselves as with their leader.The first rule of any lunchtime rally in December is that it should start on time. Even on a day of pale watery sunlight, you quickly get cold just standing around. The event had been meant to start at 2pm, but half an hour later there was still no sign of Corbyn. Several people standing near me gave up and headed home. There was only so much excitement they could take. One bloke muttered: “I’m going to give him five more minutes and then I’m going to bugger off and do some yoga.” Five minutes later, the Downward Dog buggered off.“Get it on the road,” another man yelled. “Or we’re going to the pub.” The rest of the crowd just stayed put. They were here because they were here because they were here. You’ve needed to be a stoic to be a Labour supporter in this campaign.Forty minutes later than billed, Labour’s Bristol West candidate, Thangam Debbonaire, who had been jumping up and down to keep warm, and Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, took to the makeshift stage. “Wow,” cried Debbonaire, desperately trying to inject some excitement into the proceedings. “Give yourself a huge cheer if you want a Labour government.” The response was a somewhat apathetic cheer. She tried again to provoke some kind of reaction from the crowd, but no one was willing to play ball. Too out of it, still pissed off the event was running so late. Or just plain hypothermic.Next up was Rees, who sounded more struggling supply teacher than motivational speaker. The words were all in the right order but no one had come for a lecture on Boris Johnson’s racism, the failings of the Tory government and existential ennui. They had come to be inspired. By the time Rees had finished, most of the crowd had lost the will to live.Debbonaire looked round helplessly. Where was the headline act? Someone behind her shrugged. Haven’t a clue, mate. In desperation, Debbonaire ad-libbed some of the highlights of her own set that she had delivered just minutes earlier. “Who wants a Labour government?” “Is Boris a liar?” In an ideal world, the crowd would have responded by singing Bon Jovi’s, “Woah, We’re half way there  Woah, Thangham Debbonaire.” But, sadly, this was no Richard Curtis romcom.Eventually, a murmur went round that Corbyn was in the vicinity and nearly an hour later than planned he climbed on to the podium to a desultory chorus of “Oh Je-re-my Cor-byn”. At the last election this chant had come to sound almost devotional. A hymn. Now it’s just a barely conscious Pavlovian response. The last vestige of a failing leadership.Not that Corbyn didn’t give it his best shot. These are the gigs he loves best. A big – well, biggish – crowd with whom to get up close and personal. You wouldn’t catch Boris getting anywhere near this close to members of the public that hadn’t been prevetted: he can’t do empathy and he hasn’t the bravery.“Hello Bristol, hello West Country,” the Labour leader shouted, before going into his standard stump speech. Nine years of austerity. Four million children in poverty. The UK condemned by the United Nations. Labour could turn this round and would protect the NHS. Of Brexit there was barely a mention – just one whispered remembrance of things past. He remains desperate to make a Brexit election about anything other than Brexit.Corbyn ended with a popular crowd favourite of climate change. At times he yelled so loud that he almost lost his voice. But he just wasn’t getting much back. In the past these gigs had been mutual love-ins. Now he was pouring his heart and soul into his act and getting next to nothing back. The chemistry just wasn’t there. People just weren’t feeling it in the way they once had. They had come for a glimmer of hope. They left with the scars of a raging against the dying of the light.John Crace’s new book, Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse, is published by  Faber.

And fundamentally, the choice is: do you have hope and investment for the future, or do you go down the market road with the Tories?”Asked whether it had been the right approach to pour activists and resources into winning Tory-held seats, he said: “I’ve been to 60-something seats already. Most of them are offensive marginals, where we’re trying to win them. I haven’t been to that many places that we’re defending, but I want to support colleagues who’ve done a great job – so I went to Crewe to support Laura Smith, we’re going to Stroud to support David Drew. But most of the places we’ve been to are places we’re going to win.”He acknowledged concerns about what he called Labour’s “comprehensive” manifesto, which some candidates have complained is so packed with consumer giveaways that many voters are baffled.“As the manifesto was being put together, I was one who was always cautious about an overlong manifesto,” he said. But he pointed to the “enthusiasm of people to write it” and the need to set out Labour’s policies in detail on issues including the environment. “I think it’s right to do that,” he added.With just two more days of campaigning to go, Boris Johnson’s party retains a comfortable lead in most polls, despite questions over whether Johnson’s “get Brexit done” slogan dramatically underplays the challenges looming in 2020. Labour’s most likely route to government on Friday is with the cooperation of other, smaller parties. But Corbyn rejected the idea that voters should vote tactically for the best-placed candidate to beat the Conservatives. Asked about it, he simply repeated, “I would encourage people to vote Labour. I would encourage people to vote Labour.”Challenged about whether he is good at reaching out beyond Labour’s loyal base, to win over ex-Tory voters, Corbyn said: “I do my best to. I’ve been a member of parliament for a very long time, I’ve travelled around this country for years, and I’ve got a love and an understanding of this country and the brilliant bits of local history and ersity that we have. And I love it.”Labour’s appeal during the campaign has sometimes appeared to be a moral one – to voters’ social responsibility, more than to their pockets. But Corbyn insisted that the party’s message was altruistic as well as practical. “It’s both.”He added: “I meet people in reasonable jobs, in middle age, who thought life was getting stable for them and they were doing OK, and suddenly in their late 40s and 50s they are having to borrow money to put their kids through uni, or watch their kids get into debt. Or they’re having to give up work to look after elderly parents who need social care. They’re actually paying the price for austerity as much as those children living in poverty.”Asked how he would appeal to leave voters, Corbyn was keen to highlight the fact that Labour’s new Brexit deal, which he has promised to secure within three months, would be negotiated by a “balanced” team.That suggests Sir Keir Starmer, who has been shadow Brexit secretary for three years, would find himself accompanied by at least one leave supporter, perhaps from a seat outside London.Some of Corbyn’s supporters have complained that the party’s stance has skewed too much towards remain in the past 12 months, in a way that has prejudiced its chances in seats in the Midlands and the north.Corbyn said: “I say to those people who voted leave, I’m sure you voted leave for many, many reasons, but I doubt you voted leave to see our manufacturing industry decimated or the protections and rights we have at work damaged. We’ll put that choice before the people of this country.”He refused to engage with questions about whether he would step down on Friday if Labour fails to deprive Johnson of a majority. “We’re intending to win on Thursday, so the question doesn’t arise,” he said.Many party insiders are openly speculating about who could succeed Corbyn. Several potential leftwing successors, including Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner and Laura Pidcock, have taken prominent roles in the campaign.Other possible candidates who have embraced a remain stance, including Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have been allowed little presence, amid fears among Labour strategists of Brexit voters being deterred.One approach mooted at the party’s conference in September was that Corbyn’s old ally John McDonnell could take over as an interim leader, after a rule change made by Labour’s ruling national executive committee that was overshadowed at the time by the failed putsch against Tom Watson.A contest for the deputy leadership is already looming in the coming months, after Watson announced that he would not stand again for parliament. His former seat, West Bromwich East, is among those that Labour fears could be at risk on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3af074a75d9d08297e636b90c0f5f34807d753c/147_0_4835_2902/master/4835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f9200bfbb59f159df64cdd9ae3a20ba","title":"sturgeon toughens stance on labour and independence vote","story":"SNP leader says support would depend on principle that Holyrood sets referendum dateNicola Sturgeon has refused to rule out withholding the Scottish National party’s support from a Labour budget if Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister failed to give Holyrood the powers necessary to hold an independence referendum in 2020.In a further toughening of her stance, Sturgeon said she would offer SNP support to a Labour minority government only if it accepted the principle that it is for Holyrood to decide the timing of the second referendum.Asked if she could be definitive that her party would vote down a Labour budget if Corbyn refused the section 30 order needed by Holyrood to organise a vote next year, Sturgeon told the : “The principle is that the fact of and the timing of an independence referendum should be for the Scottish parliament, elected by the Scottish people, to decide.“I just don’t believe, if you have the potential for a minority Labour government, they are going to turn their back on the ability to govern over the question of a year.”Pressed on whether voters should believe that the SNP would scupper a minority Labour administration similarly over the issue of one year, the first minister replied: “The SNP under my leadership would not ever, in any circumstances, vote for a Conservative Queen’s speech or budget.“We will be offering support to a minority Labour government. We’re simply saying that principle should be respected.”Sturgeon and Corbyn clashed bitterly on this question earlier in the campaign, with Corbyn rejecting Sturgeon’s offer of a “progressive alliance” to defeat Boris Johnson and accusing her of being willing to usher in “another heartless Conservative government”.But in recent weeks Labour has revealed itself to be increasingly open to the prospect of a second independence referendum in 2021 if Scotland returns a pro-independence majority in that year’s Holyrood elections.Next year is already a busy one for Scotland, with the potential for another EU referendum and preparations for the Holyrood election campaign. The former SNP leader Alex Salmond’s trial for a series of alleged sexual assaults is set for March, and Glasgow will host a UN climate conference in November. Would an independence campaign get the focus it merits?Dismissing the Salmond trial as “irrelevant in this context”, Sturgeon replied: “If you take the future of the UK in the European Union, the whole climate change issue, these are all relevant in terms of Scotland’s ability to shape its own future.“I think it’s important if we are to allow ourselves to have the maximum potential to shape our own future, as opposed to have it shaped for us, that we have the ability to do so on that timescale.”In contrast to Corbyn, Boris Johnson has pledged to deny the Scottish government a section 30 order under any circumstances. Holyrood’s constitutional relations secretary, Michael Russell, hinted earlier in the election campaign that the Scottish government could resort to legal action in that case.Sturgeon refused to elaborate, saying: “We’ll consider all the options but I’m not going to get into the detail of that right now. People have got the right over the next few days of having the focus being on do we want Boris Johnson to be in the position of calling these shots or don’t we?”Speaking to the  from the SNP’s yellow election battlebus, Sturgeon said: “Personally I’ve found this to be quite a happy and warm campaign, even though it’s been bloody freezing outside.”One of the SNP’s central messages has been about “locking the Tories out of Downing Street”. However, polling suggests the main SNP gains will be from Labour, which is predicted to lose all but one of its six Scottish seats.Asked whether this represented a failure of strategy, Sturgeon said: “Polls don’t decide elections and nothing is inevitable. For as long as there is time left to make the argument, I’ll make the argument that Scotland should play its part in locking the Tories out of government. And the SNP is the best place to try and do that.”Despite gloomy predictions during the summer about the impact on the Scottish Tories’ fortunes of the departure of their leader Ruth Davidson and Johnson becoming head of the UK party, their support does not appear to have dipped significantly.“I’ve spoken to countless people on this campaign trail who have said to me they are not SNP voters normally, and they wouldn’t necessarily vote for independence in a referendum, but they want to make sure they vote in a way that maximises the chances of keeping the Tories out of government.“There’s no doubt that there’s a narrative, discussion and consideration around tactical voting in this election that I have not experienced previously.”With the SNP running second in all Scottish Tory seats, she added: “People understand that this election is not going to decide the issue of independence. People may well vote SNP to keep the Tories out, given the crossroads and the prospect of Boris Johnson for five years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/130412f36e27e29a1091c0d3dfce0414fc9a6c71/1115_32_2716_1630/master/2716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6a13f4672ec40449a4889eb7c4ac459","title":"general election labour sets out plan for first 100 days in office live news","story":"Latest news as general election campaign enters its final daysThat’s all from me for tonight.Thanks for the comments.The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has posted this video clip of an incident involving Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, a special adviser to Matt Hancock, outside Leeds general hospital. If this is the only incident of physical contact, it does not really amount to him being hit, which is the allegation that was being made earlier and given to journalists. To say that he was hit would normally imply some intent. This video shows him being hit by accident.The Conservatives are on course to make significant gains in Wales, according to a YouGov poll.Roger Awan-Scully, head of politics at Cardiff University, projected that if the figures are accurate this could leave Labour with 20 seats in Wales (down from 28 in 2017). The Conservatives could win 16 (10 more than in 2017)Awan-Scully said this would be the lowest Labour seat number in Wales since 1983 (when there were 38 rather than 40).The poll was carried out for ITV Wales and Cardiff University.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been visiting Leeds General Infirmary, in an attempt to defuse the row generated by four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on the floor there when being treated, and Boris Johnson’s reaction to it.He told BBC News that he was “horrified” by what happened. As a parent of young children who has had to visit A\u0026ampE with them, he said he could understand how the parents felt. Asked what he would say to them, he replied:It’s not good enough, and I’ve apologised. But Hancock said Jack’s parents were not blaming the staff. And he said the hospital accepted it had a problem, and that it was taking steps to deal with it.He also said the government was putting in investment to address exactly this sort of problem.Asked why he had come in person, he said he wanted to get reassurance that the trust was doing everything it could. He said he had been impressed by their response, and by the work of the staff.Here are the main points from Boris Johnson’s Q\u0026ampA earlier.It is also worth pointing out that Johnson seemed keen to set this running as a story because he was also facing strong criticism over another story with the potential to hog the headlines ...The great thing about the deal that we have ready to go is that it protects businesses, it protects supply chains, it means we leave the EU with our relationships absolutely intact, so that we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota relationship with the EU as we come out. We protect our supply chains ....The thing about the deal we’ve got ... it makes sure we have complete equivalence when it comes to our standards, our industrial requirements and the rest of it. So, as we come out, it’s all protected from the point of view of big, motor manufacturing investors in our country ...We have a decent deal ... What it also does is it keeps us in a state of grace, a state of equivalence with our European Union friends and partners. So the zero-tariff, zero-quota arrangements that we have, the just-in-time supply chains, they remain absolutely there, perfect and intact. Under Johnson’s withdrawal agreement, Britain would be in a transition period until the end of 2020, during which current trade arrangements would continue to apply. This may be what Johnson was referring to when he spoke about the UK staying in a “state of equivalence”. But Johnson also seemed to be implying that this would be a long-term goal. As explained earlier (see 11.10am), an eventual trade deal that fully protects supply chains might be possible – but only if Johnson were to abandon what he has said in the past about wanting a Brexit that would allow the UK to erge from EU regulation.They have pledged to me personally to support the deal we have done. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which they fail to do that. We haven’t lobotomised them, they’ve done it of their own free will, they believe in this deal, they see it’s the best way forward for our country and I think they will be crazy if they didn’t see it was the best way forward.According to BuzzFeed’s Alex Wickham, the Tory proposal to abolish the licence fee isn’t just something dreamed up this afternoon to distract attention from the row about Boris Johnson’s response to the story about a boy having to sleep on a hospital floor. Wickham says No 10 aides have been looking at this for weeks.That doesn’t mean, of course, that Johnson’s decision to talk about it today wasn’t a distraction exercise (or a “dead cat”, to use Lynton Croby’s terminology). It certainly looked as if Johnson was talking this up (ignoring his own advice not to announce policy “on the hoof”) to get reporters off the hospital story. And this is what Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary and outgoing Labour deputy leader, said about Boris Johnson’s comment about considering abolishing the licence fee (See 2.37pm.). Watson said:This is a pathetic attempt by Boris Johnson to distract from his refusal to even look at the picture of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on a hospital floor.We already know that Boris Johnson is a danger to our NHS.His comments today reveal that he will threaten the very existence of another of Britain’s great institutions, the BBC, by scrapping its funding mechanism.This is on top of the cruel decision to strip over-75s of their free TV licences.And here is Jeremy Corbyn commenting on the photograph that Boris Johnson did not want to talk about.Jeremy Corbyn has refused to say whether he would resign as Labour leader if Boris Johnson won the election. When he was asked this, he replied:We put forward a positive manifesto with a fully costed programme and I am taking that message out all over the country.That message is getting home to people. They realise this Thursday is a straight choice: do you want to carry on with austerity and underfunding of public services or do you want a Labour government that will tax fairly to fund properly.ICM has a new poll out. It suggests the Conservatives have a lead of just six points, which would put the UK in hung parliament territory, although, of course, it is not in line with most other polling, which points to Boris Johnson having a much bigger lead.In his Q\u0026ampA in Sunderland Boris Johnson was twice asked about his attempt to avoid having to look at a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview.The first question came from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, who asked if that incident said something about whether the Tories understood the real concerns of people living in the north of England. Johnson gave a general answer, without saying anything specific about his earlier interview with ITV’s Joe Pike. (See 1.36pm.) Johnson said:I’m very proud of what we’re doing to rebuild Leeds general infirmary and it’s one of the hospitals we will rebuild from the beginning, it’ll be a fantastic project.One of your biggest challenges in this election is to persuade people that you really do care, that you really are trustworthy. And yet today when you’re shown that picture of the four-year-old boy on the floor of an A\u0026ampE department you take the phone away and put it in your pocket, what does that say about how much you really care?Johnson said he had already addressed this. He went on:We are not only investing in children’s services in Leeds but we’re also rebuilding the whole Leeds infirmary from top to bottom. And we can do that because we’re now putting the biggest ever investment into the NHS. What I don’t want to see is a fantastic programme that is going to unite and level up our country being blocked again.In the original interview, when Pike did eventually get Johnson to look at the picture of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on a hospital floor, Johnson said:It’s a terrible, terrible photo. And I apologise obviously to the families and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS.But what we are doing is supporting the NHS, and on the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had.That’s why we’re making huge investments into the NHS, and we can only do it if we get parliament going, if we unblock the current deadlock, and we move forward.Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at a rally in Bristol.He is holding up the Daily Mirror splash, which features the story about four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on a hospital floor. He says the Tories have had nine years to invest properly in the NHS.It’s a child with pneumonia on the floor of a hospital in modern Britain. This is a disgrace. They need to invest in our public services.He also says Labour would not allow the NHS to be sold off to the Americans. He says the US wants to enter the British healthcare market. But healthcare stopped being a market when the NHS was set up by Labour in the 1940s, he says.This is what Boris Johnson said about considering scrapping the TV licence. He was responding to a question about what he would not abolish all TV licences.At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licences, though I am certainly looking at it. What I will say is that – I’m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof. But you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a media organisation still make sense in the long term, given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves. That’s all I will say.I think the system of funding out of what is effectively a general tax – everybody has a TV – bears reflection, let me put it that way. How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels? That is the question.Abolishing the TV licence would have huge implications for the BBC, which relies on the TV licence for its funding.Johnson said that he did not want to make up policy on the hoof, but it did sound as if he was deliberating floating this as an idea – knowing that it would get picked up enthusiastically by the media (journalists are particularly interested in stories about how media organisations get their money – because he is also facing a lot of negative coverage over his attempt to avoid having to confront a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview. (See 1.36pm.) He did get tough questions about this at the Q\u0026ampA too.I will post a full summary soon.Boris Johnson said he is ‘looking at’ scrapping the BBC licence fee.Responding to a question about why he would not abolish all TV licences, Boris Johnson said: ‘At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licences, though I am certainly looking at it.‘I think the system of funding out of what is effectively a general tax – everybody has a TV – bears reflection, let me put it that way.

But the agency hopes the mission will pave the way for a wide-reaching clear-up operation, with Esa’s director general calling for new rules that would compel those who launch satellites to take responsibility for removing them from orbit once they are retired from use.“Imagine how dangerous sailing the high seas would be if all the ships ever lost in history were still drifting on top of the water,” said Jan Wörner, Esa’s director general. “That is the current situation in orbit, and it cannot be allowed to continue.”In the past 60 years, thousands of tonnes of junk has accumulated around the Earth, including old rocket parts, about 3,500 defunct satellites and an estimated 750,000 smaller fragments, some from collisions between larger bits of junk. The fragments are typically circulating with a velocity of 20,000kmh (12,500mph).Unless a clear-up operation is mounted, the chances of collisions will escalate as thousands more satellites are put into orbit.Funding for the mission was agreed at Space19+, ESA’s misterial council, which took place in Seville, Spain, at the end of November. The mission will be run by a consortium led by a Swiss startup called Clearspace.The target for ClearSpace-1 is a piece of junk called Vespa, which was left in an orbit around 800km above the Earth by ESA’s Vega launcher in 2013. Vespa weighs 100kg – around the size of a small satellite – and was selected because it has a simple shape and sturdy construction, which make it unlikely to fragment when it is grabbed.The “chaser” ClearSpace space probe will be launched into the target orbit where it will track down Vespa, grab it using a quartet of robotic arms and drag it out of orbit, with Vespa and the chaser both burning up in the atmosphere on the way down to Earth.A future ambition is to create a clear-up robot that could eject junk into the atmosphere, before continuing to capture and de-orbit other pieces of junk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19881050d55e63b93fa6d29a8a8e6334faad9b67/0_18_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c668145cae27742d8c7555a0dbdd8ec","title":"five ways to get your family into classical music","story":"Classical music offers something for everyone, says Kate Faithfull-Williams, from toddlers to teens to the kid rolling their eyes as they read this over your shoulder …Classical music can be daunting. With a genre dating back hundreds of years, the choices are overwhelming. So where do you start? With the benefits, that’s where.“Music brings people together and helps kids – and parents – listen better,” says composer John Webb, who has worked with everyone from five-year-old songwriters to traditional Indian musicians and a virtual symphony orchestra to introduce new audiences to classical music. Classical tracks are also scientifically proven to relieve stress, boost brainpower and even help us be more open emotionally – all good news for happy families. So, here’s how to get involved ...Toddlers and preschoolers“Young kids are innately musical,” says Webb, mimicking the singsong speech and extended vowel sounds we instinctively use with small people – “Ooh what a bee-yoo-tiful baby”. Children have an unrepressed desire to dance, too. “Kids move in different ways to different music, tiptoeing, stamping and twirling,” explains Webb.So how can you bring out the best in your mini maestro? Composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty topped the iTunes Classical Charts, says: “Try listening to Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns, which describes lots of wild animals through music.”From age five to eightDid you know that this is the prime age for children to write music? “Kids naturally make up their own songs as they play,” says Webb, who generously describes those improvised 10-second tunes as, “mashups”. To enhance that natural ability, he advises using a story as a hook. “Kids love stories, and quickly understand that different notes and speeds of music create a sense of character. Classical music is easily simplified and it can be creative and powerful for children.”Want to get involved? Try something like the BBC Singers Family Concert (9 February 2020, Milton Court Concert Hall, Barbican, London prices from £5), which promises to be very interactive and is aimed at kids aged five and over. Alternatively, join the BBC Concert Orchestra at Musical Roots (22 February 2020, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, London prices from £5) for a magical adventure the whole family can enjoy, exploring exciting and unusual connections between composers, their music and their families.From age nine to 12You may know that playing an instrument can improve a child’s memory and coordination, and teach them perseverance. You definitely know that persuading your pre-teen to practise playing an instrument is like lighting a stick of dynamite, so explosive are the arguments.The solution, suggests Davis, could be as simple as inspiring your child by letting them see someone older play their instrument expertly. The BBC is laying on two upcoming events that will transport young people into a different world and get them excited about playing.Try Family Total Immersion: Lift Off! (1 December, Barbican Hall, London prices from £5) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, which celebrates 50 years since the moon landing with live music, interactive workshops and film to take you on a musical adventure through space. Best of all, there are more than two hours of drop-in foyer activities, including the chance for kids to try a variety of instruments before the show.David Walliams is also doing a special performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (2 May 2020, Barbican, London prices from £5), which is virtually guaranteed to hook kids into playing classical music. Walliams will read from his bestselling children’s books, including Bad Dad and The World’s Worst Children, alongside musical treats from a full orchestra.The teenage yearsCan parents introduce anything to their sceptical teen? “The kiss of death is for a parent to show keenness,” warns Webb. “Osmosis is your best bet, so play the pieces you like at home. Go for tracks with a pounding rhythm and bleakness, like Shostakovich Symphony No 5, as the raw energy and emotion may get your teen’s attention.”Film can also be a good entry point for teenagers. “I would always point towards innovative composers and performers who are very current,” says Davis. “So maybe don’t start with Mozart. Instead, go for composers like Max Richter, who scored Mary Queen of Scots, or Joby Talbot, who scored The League of Gentlemen. Both Richter and Talbot are also serious concert hall composers in their own right.” Talbot’s Everest will be performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra next year (20 June 2020, Barbican Hall, London prices from £10).If all else fails …Stealth is a weapon at your disposal. “There are so many great concerts out there, but the mistake is dragging a reluctant child to a classical concert and expecting them to walk out enlightened and interested,” warns Davis. “So find an appropriate concert of music your child might grow to like and research the music that’s going to be performed. Play sections of it in the car and at home ahead of the concert. Otherwise it’s a huge amount to take in. As the composer Philip Glass once said: ‘People don’t know what they love, they love what they know.’”Learn more about getting the whole family into classical music with advice and events from the BBC’s Get Involved initiative"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59bba9d2045a741667bf76d317e9c32344ec49f9/0_9_811_487/master/811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d24c179e5fee0302edb29461f6d1bc8","title":"england women win first odi pakistan","story":"Openers Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt hit one-day international hundreds as England made a winning start against Pakistan in Malaysia.The pair shared a first-wicket stand of 188 to set up a 75-run victory at Kuala Lumpur’s Kinrara Oval in the opening game of an ICC Women’s Championship series featuring three ODIs and three Twenty20s.Beaumont struck nine fours in her 107 from 141 balls before becoming one of Rameen Shamim’s three victims.

This is a delicate truth. It might yet change.After all, Russia will still be able to host Euro 2020 matches, and play in the competition, because Wada’s ruling applies only to global events, not continental ones. And while there will be no raising of the Russian tricolour, or full-blooded cries of “Rossiya – svyashchennaya nasha derzhava!” at the Tokyo Olympics next year, hundreds of Russian athletes are likely to be given the all-clear to participate if they can prove they are not linked to their country’s doping programme.Informed sources in the Olympic movement and Wada have already suggested that a similar solution to the one imposed for the Pyeongchang Winter Games in 2018 is on the cards, with Wada – and then the court of arbitration for sport – being the ultimate arbiters over who can compete in Tokyo. Remember that Russia was officially banned from Pyeongchang. And yet what happened next? 168 athletes clad in Russian red marched into the Olympic Stadium, acknowledged the crowd’s applause at the opening ceremony and heard the announcer cry: “Ladies and gentlemen, the Olympic Athletes from Russia!” And if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it usually is a duck.Meanwhile, Fifa says it will “clarify the extent of the decision” with Wada before saying anything about Russia’s potential participation at the 2022 World Cup. But given the supreme reluctance of football’s governing body to criticise Russia before it hosted the 2018 tournament – even after the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren found overwhelming evidence that more than 1,000 athletes in 30 sports had been involved in a state-sponsored doping programme – don’t hold your breath.Tellingly Russia’s sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov, has already indicated that his country will appeal against the decision of Wada’s executive committee, saying he believes their “prospects are quite good”.Who knows what Cas will decide? But we can say this for certain: its legal judgments often wrong-foot perceived wisdom.Before the 2018 Winter Games it overturned the lifetime Olympic bans of 28 Russian athletes – prompting widespread angst and outrage – with even usually stoic figures in anti-doping worried about the consequences for elite sport.No retreat, no surrender: that has been the Russian way from the start. Pretty much everyone now accepts the country was engaged in extraordinary levels of deception and manipulation when it comes to doping – except, of course, the Russians themselves.It started in 2011 and led to hundreds of Russian athletes being given a cocktail of banned substances including methenolone, trenbolone and oxandrolone – which were mixed with alcohol (Chivas whisky for male athletes and Martini vermouth for women) to improve the absorption of the steroids and shorten the detection window, and then spat out. Grigor Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory who later turned whistleblower, even had a name for his concoction: “The Duchess”, after the popular Russian cocktail.It was Rodchenkov who also revealed how Russia corrupted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi – after the FSB, its security service, developed a method to open anti-doping bottles surreptitiously. After each day’s competition tainted samples from Russian athletes were passed through a mouse hole into an adjacent room where they were opened and switched for clean urine in the dead of night.It allowed the Russians to continue to use steroids during the Games, handing them an even bigger advantage. And they would have got away with it, too, but for Rodchenkov, who fled the country in 2015 with hard drives containing thousands of pieces of evidence.The latest twist in this sprawling drama came in January when Wada’s executive committee was finally able to extract a database from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory to help it prosecute inidual Russian athletes. But that database was recently found to have been manipulated to conceal failed drug tests – leading to the four-year ban.Unsurprisingly Rodchenkov, who is now in a witness protection programme in the United States, feels vindicated. But he also wants Wada to go further.“As usual Russia has disregarded all of its promises and obligations to clean sport,” he said on Monday. “The Moscow database from my laboratory was manipulated. Tons of files and results were deleted. After all of this, who can say whether there are any clean athletes in Russia if the crucial data is lost? The results of the London and Sochi Olympics should be reanalysed and reconsidered with the new knowledge available today. We need to take the strongest action to bring justice back to sport.”Unsurprisingly Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency and a vocal critic of Russia, agrees, saying Wada had not gone nearly far enough.“To allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow,” he warned. “There is no disputing that Russia has committed the most intentional, deep and broad level of corruption on the entire sports world that has put money over morals, abuse over health and corruption over the Olympic values and all athlete’s dreams.”Yet the approach of the International Olympic Committee and Wada is to try to punish Russia the country, while preserving natural justice for athletes who have not failed any test or been implicated in any wrongdoing. As one influential onlooker put it: “There is quite rightly a big desire to see punishment. But it seems that it is not so easy to punish the guilty.”Meanwhile, of the few Russian athletes to speak out against doping the world high jump champion, Mariya Lasitskene, recently lamented the situation in her country, saying: “Clean athletes are still defenceless and not sure they’ll be able to compete tomorrow.”And despite the apparently emphatic nature of Monday’s verdict, the fate of Russia – and by extension Lasitskene and the country’s other athletes – remains in an uneasy limbo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5a4f4f836053ad48daa75676936c7f1de62860/0_408_4129_2477/master/4129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bd7aab68a702e534021a88e3b08f012","title":"dickens christmas carol old vic wiltons music hall","story":"This year, the tried-and-tested tale at London’s Old Vic is up against subversive surprises at Wilton’s Music Hall, where Scrooge’s sister takes the leadCharles Dickens knew he had struck gold when he published his “little Christmas book” in 1843. Within a year, A Christmas Carol had spawned nine stage shows, 127 recitals by the author and a pirated version (Dickens, a crusader not only for Christmas cheer but also for copyright, promptly sued).It hasn’t stopped jolting tears and pricking consciences ever since, with its Christian message for a more compassionate capitalism in the face of child poverty. Except two new London productions are not singing from the same carol sheet about grumpy old men made good.Jack Thorne’s adaptation is the tried-and-tested one, now in its third run at the Old Vic (★★★☆☆) and also currently on Broadway. A handsome production, it uses every bell and whistle to try and melt the hardest heart, from carol singing to handbell ringing, a stupendous feast in which food is whizzed down to the stage from the gods and a snow-flurry across the auditorium that only mildly whiffs of washing-up liquid.Matthew Warchus, as director, and Rob Howell, as set and costume designer, ramp up the spectacle with dangling lanterns and lugubrious light and shadows when the three ghosts, all female, appear. The stage is multipronged in shape, reaching into the audience and occasionally inviting participation.Paterson Joseph’s Scrooge is not an enfeebled old man but an angry physical presence he twitches his muscles, speaks in stentorian tones and wipes a sea of sweat from his brow. It is a muscular interpretation of the moneylender but does not allow vulnerability in early enough, so Scrooge’s Damascene transformation feels too sudden.“There is much about comfort in the story,” wrote GK Chesterton of Dickens’s story and Thorne’s iteration offers very traditional comforts, mince pies notwithstanding. It feels polished but twee by the time Tiny Tim (Rayhaan Kufuor-Gray, one of four actors in the role) rings the final handbell and wrings (some of) our hearts.At Wilton’s Music Hall, Piers Torday’s radical Christmas Carol – A Fairy Tale (★★★★☆) could not be further from tradition even the turkey is spared from death thanks to a vegan alternative. Scrooge is not Scrooge as we know him either but a “her” – Ebenezer’s sister, Fan, who dies in the novella. Here we find she married Marley and lived with him in miserable marital bondage.Fan Scrooge is not Dickens’s morally deficient “wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner”, although she has shut up her heart after feeling undermined in Victorian society. Sally Dexter is a bonneted, severe-looking woman with a passing resemblance to Miss Havisham who occasionally speaks with clunky stridency (“I am a woman and I have lived a life men made for me”). More often, she is quick-witted and wry.“You’ve changed,” she tells Marley when his apparition appears in chains, and then: “I want a orce.” Guided in part by Friedrich Engels’s The Condition of the Working Class in England (a Christmas present from Bob Cratchit), she invents her own happy ending in which she buys a school for fallen women, turns it into “Fran’s School for Empowered Young Women” and enlists Ann Cratchit to run it.Everything about this production is delightfully surprising and subversive, even if it feels occasionally scrappy. The satire on gender works on the whole the ghosts are imaginatively conceived, particularly that of the present – a giant puppet (voiced by Edward Harrison) who has embraced new age philosophies on how to live in “the now”. The ghost of the future is reminiscent of an MR James spectre made of twisted bedsheets (the role is jointly played by Chisara Agor and Ruth Ollman), and projects Fan into the modern day to witness the burdens of the professional woman, multitasking to harrowing degrees.Jo Lakin’s puppetry is used to charming effect and if Tom Piper’s set design is not as grand as Howell’s, it is still fluid and conjures ghostliness. Torday tells us that Dickens’s own daughter, Katey, felt he never understood women. But “if the courses be departed from, the ends will change”, says Scrooge in Dickens’s story. Maybe this new ending offers both the story, and its 19th-century writer, a welcome 21st-century transformation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c261c1351154f74f4a898e21724b3ede5ddf94/557_888_4535_2721/master/4535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b3c78a3cd66af2d331a8e1fc077fdaa","title":"little miss burden review bunker london","story":"Bunker, LondonMatilda Ibini’s autobiographical coming-of-age play mixes serious scenes with underpowered comedy sketchesLittle Miss Burden begins as a Jackanory-style story, narrated by two grating TV presenters, about a girl with a physical disability. They are stopped in their tracks when Little Miss herself enters in her wheelchair to stake a claim to the narration.Matilda Ibini’s autobiographical coming-of-age play dramatises the intersections of race, gender and disability. The point that stories of disability must be told by those with lived experience is robustly made: “We trust people to tell their own stories,” says Little Miss in the opening scene.Ibini mixes humour with trauma to take us from Little Miss’s birth to the medical mysteries of her condition, which is eventually diagnosed as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). But before that come her mother’s denial of Little Miss’s condition and her two sisters’ insistence that they will one day form a 1990s girl-band together.Little Miss, played by Saida Ahmed, is a lovable character and the script travels through her milestones, big and small, from amusing discoveries about sex to periods, binge eating, depression, self-loathing and finally to acceptance. No detail is spared, and there are a few extraneous scenes that add little dramatically and make the play feel overlong.More problematically, the whimsical and humorous sketches push up against the serious subject matter and the tone begins to wobble the comedy is not always strong enough and the darker moments are not sharply defined against this levity. The wavering tone dilutes the more impactful scenes of playground bullying, visits to a London church whose pastors insist that a ine miracle can “heal” her disability if only she keeps enough faith, and to a herbalist in Nigeria in hope of a cure for her genetic condition.The pop band routines don’t quite work either the sisters (Michelle Tiwo as Big Sis and Ani Nelson as Little Sis) act out multiple parts and while they are enthusiastic performers, the transitions are not always convincing and their musical routines look like hairdryer-dancing in a teenage bedroom. Even if this is deliberate, the results feel underpowered.What this play does do successfully is show disability – a rare thing in theatre – and its full human drama. There are some light, irreverent and charming touches. The ideas are all there too, waiting to be honed into something shorter, sharper and more potent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d2b7ac379d13ff9b8872e5b3592501567878bae/716_680_3583_2151/master/3583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db5d248a443ed06ad10aad0d918ce351","title":"airpods pro review a touch of apple magic","story":"Good sound, solid battery life and effective noise cancelling wrapped up in a tiny, potent packageApple’s true wireless earbuds have gone “pro” and in doing so deliver on the promise of the 2017 originals. The new AirPods Pro are worth the wait.Apple managed two pieces of magic in 2017 with the original £159 AirPods. They just worked without the skips, blips or audio delay, and came in a tiny battery case that kept them charged and safe – a combination that competitors still find hard to match.But they had one big problem: no isolation from the outside world. It meant that in any noisy environment you struggled to hear your music.Three years later, the £249 AirPods Pro and their silicone earbud tips fix that fundamental problem, adding active noise cancelling for good measure.The look, feel and operation of the AirPods Pro will be familiar to anyone who has seen or used the original AirPods. Small white earbuds replete with stalks and a small flip-top white case into which they snap to store and charge.The stalks are a little smaller and have a squeezable control surface on them. But the biggest difference is the little silicone earbud tip that helps to block out noise.In true Apple fashion the ear tips aren’t standard – replacements cost $4 per pair in the US but the UK cost is currently unknown. You get three sizes in the box and they are easy enough to swap between but hard to pull off by accident. There’s also a fit test on the iPhone that detects if you’ve got the correct size earbud with a good seal.At 5.4g per earbud the AirPods Pro are 1.4g heavier than the AirPods but still light and well balanced. Once inserted the AirPods Pro are some of the most comfortable and secure-fitting true wireless earbuds available rivalling Samsung’s Galaxy Buds and Libratone Track Air+ on that front. Put them in and as long as you don’t brush the stalks you’ll forget there there.The charging case is a smidgen bigger and heavier than that of the AirPods, but that still makes it one of the smallest and best available. It fits in the money pocket of your jeans, holds the AirPods Pro tightly and the lid closes with a satisfying snap.The case charges via Qi wireless charging or Apple’s proprietary Lightning cable. The AirPods Pro offer more than four hours of continuous listening with noise cancelling active and charge in the case about five times, with a total play time of more than 24 hours.While good, rivals such as the Track Air+ last for about six hours between charges with noise cancelling on. Four hours is certainly good enough for general wearing and commuting but not for long-haul flights.Pairing is just as easy as previous versions of the AirPods. With an iPhone or iPad all you have to do is open them near the device and follow the instructions. The pairing information is then synced between all your Apple devices using iCloud, so you can seamlessly switch between an iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Mac or even Apple TV.They work well with non-Apple devices too, supporting the Bluetooth 5.0 standard or earlier revisions. With the earbuds in the open case, press the button on the back to pair them with anything else such as a Windows PC or Android device. But you need an Apple device to change settings and update the earbuds.The AirPods Pro have the same H1 chip as the AirPods 2 and Beats PowerBeats Pro, and as such have similar bullet-proof, lag-free connectivity and the ability to share audio with other H1-supporting devices meaning two people can listen to one iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.New for the AirPods Pro is a pressure-detecting surface on the stalks. Squeeze the pad, rather than tap or swipe, once for pause, twice for skip forward or thrice to skip back. What felt odd to start with coming from the swipes and taps of other earbuds quickly became second nature.Squeeze and hold to either activate Siri or switch between noise control modes. By default that’s straight from active noise cancelling to ambient listening mode, which lets in sound so you can hear announcements, but you can also turn both systems off too if you’d prefer.Take one out and the music pauses (if used with an Apple device), put it back in to start again. The only thing missing is volume control, which is a shame. Apple’s voice assistant can also listen out for its “Hey Siri” wake-word via an iPhone and Siri can read out texts and iMessages, but not WhatsApps or other notifications for now.Settings and the fit test can be reached in the Bluetooth settings on an Apple device. But you can also switch between noise control modes in Control Centre on an iPhone or iPad by long pressing on the volume control.The AirPods Pro are a step up in audio quality for Apple’s own-brand headphones, which isn’t a surprise as a good seal in the ear works wonders for full reproduction of sound. The earbuds produce tightly controlled, well-balanced highs and mids, with enough punch in the low end to produce a nice, rounded sound at pretty much any volume.They make a good go of most music genres, but those looking for real thumping basslines or who enjoy the raw energy of a thrashing guitar will have to look elsewhere. There’s no equaliser either.As such AirPods Pro sound good – but you’re not going to be discovering new nuances in your most-loved tracks in quite the same way you might with the very best-sounding headphones such as Sony’s WF-1000XM3 or Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless.The active noise cancelling on the AirPods Pro is surprisingly effective at reducing most background noise. It handled the majority of the day-to-day commute noise very well, and even stood up to engine drone on a long-haul flight. They weren’t quite as noise deadening as the excellent Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds or full-size Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 letting a little more chatter through, but they also weren’t miles off, which is remarkable given how tiny the AirPods Pro are in comparison.They also handle wind noise very well, which is something Sony’s earbuds and many noise-cancelling over-ear headphones struggle with. Even when it’s blowing a gale you can still clearly hear your music.Call quality was excellent, minimising background noise and coming across clearly to the other end of the call. But the AirPods Pro lack any sidetone, which is the ability to hear yourself in the call, making it hard to know whether you’re shouting.As well as the AirPods Pro work, they suffer from the same issue as any true wireless earbuds available at the moment. The case and each earbud has a non-replaceable battery that will eventually wear out. Repair gurus iFixit recently gave the AirPods Pro a repairability score of zero. Apple only offers full replacements, not repairs, which makes the AirPods Pro disposable.The same could be said of many wireless headphones, but also for most earphones that do not have replaceable cables, which frequently break and then are simply thrown away. All of which has an environmental cost worth considering.The AirPods Pro are a triumph for Apple. They’re small, comfortable, last long enough for most listening sessions, slot into an unrivalled truly-pocketable case and – finally – offer not only proper noise isolation thanks to silicone tips, but also surprisingly effective active noise cancellation.They have the same magic that makes the standard AirPods effortless to use, particularly with Apple’s devices. They simply work, even with Android or Windows machines.Sure, they’re expensive, and they don’t quite reach the exquisite audio highs of Sony’s WF-1000XM3 while letting a little more chatter through the noise cancelling. But they’re tiny by comparison, more comfortable to wear and have a case you can fit in the money pocket of your jeans - a convenience that simply can’t be underestimated.The biggest issue you might face with the AirPods Pro is actually getting hold of a set, as of the time of writing they’re sold out until January.Pros: secure fit, comfortable, rock-solid connectivity, good sound, great noise cancelling, sweat resistant, seamless connection between multiple Apple devices, works with Android and Windows, excellent case, wireless charging, good call qualityCons: expensive, no on-earbud volume control, no settings on AndroidWindows, not repairable, stalks, only available in white This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Now, he’s in a new thriller – and, for once, without an English accentEvery actor has a war story about a disastrous audition, but Martin Compston’s is particularly chaotic. In 2002, the Scottish actor – then in his late teens – flew down to London to audition for a guest role in an ITV period drama. Just one problem: he had been sent the wrong lines. “So they gave me what I was supposed to do and asked me to come back in 15 minutes,” he says. “It was a three-page monologue from a suicidal kid telling a doctor why he wanted to take his own life. I was so angry, it was all a blur.”The experience was enough to make Compston consider chucking in his fledgling acting career. “My agent at the time called and I told him: ‘I don’t think this is for me.’ And then he said, ‘you got the part.’ I felt like maybe I can do this, maybe there’s something there.”It was a turning point for Compston, who had not long been plucked from obscurity to play the lead in Ken Loach’s hardscrabble drug drama Sweet Sixteen. Well, sort of obscurity: the Celtic-obsessed teenager had captained Aberdeen’s youth side and was offered a contract with his local football team, Greenock Morton, before his career change. After Sweet Sixteen, he did more TV, starred in acclaimed films such as Andrea Arnold’s Red Road, and eventually ended up landing his most well-known role to date in Line of Duty, playing corruption bloodhound and baby-faced lothario DS Steve Arnott (“he’s that overdressed wanker at work who is having all the office affairs”, he says, lovingly). He recalls the challenge of convincing industry types that he could play more than just a wiry Greenock delinquent.“People assumed I was just my character from Sweet Sixteen,” he says. “I come from a working-class family but me and my brother were well looked after, we had everything we needed, we had a good education. So it was important to get in rooms with people to show them I was different from that kid.”Line of Duty has been a gripping British drama staple since it debuted in 2012, but the show’s fifth series elevated it from ratings hit to genuine phenomenon, with Stephen Graham following in the footsteps of Thandie Newton and Keeley Hawes with an explosive guest appearance. “It just took it to a whole other level,” says Compston, recalling a day when he was essentially kettled in a train station by fans desperate to learn the identity of mystery bent copper H. After affecting a South London twang as the workaholic detective, Compston is now back to a Scottish accent – albeit a Dundee one – for Traces, the first original drama from the UKTV channel Alibi. The series centres around Emma (Bafta winner Molly Windsor), a young forensic lab assistant whose return to Dundee makes a local cold case unexpectedly hot again. You might expect Compston to be playing the cop who swoops in to lead the investigation, but this is a lanyard-free role: his character, building contractor Daniel, is Emma’s love interest.Both characters are wrestling with family trauma and troubling secrets – through his work, Daniel is implicated in a lethal nightclub fire – but for a drama about coldly analysing forensic evidence, Windsor and Compston bring an appealing charge of blood-and-guts passion. “It was the sort of part I hadn’t played for a while,” says Compston. “Daniel’s a nice guy trying to do the right thing and then he’s got this wee firecracker in his life, they sort of consume each other. His head is a bit of a mess when we meet him and things just get more wild.”Compared to prickly Arnott, it is a surprisingly tender, troubled portrayal. Compston previously shared a flat with Kyle Falconer of Dundee rockers The View and drew on that experience while approaching both his character and the local accent. “I’ve had a unique insight into the mental workings of Dundonians,” he says drily.The days of flatsharing are now well behind him. In 2016, Compston married his American girlfriend, Tianna Flynn, in Greenock but home is now Las Vegas, complete with pool and – as he proudly revealed on Instagram – a customised Tennent’s lager tap. Not that he’s had much chance to use it, with work keeping him on the road. “I haven’t been in Vegas since April and I won’t get back there until Christmas and then I’ll be leaving again for four months,” he says, recounting a hectic schedule that includes shooting the sixth series of Line of Duty in Belfast early next year.He is also currently finishing filming BBC One thriller The Nest, in which he and Peaky Blinders’s Sophie Rundle star as a childless couple who recruit a mysterious surrogate. The show is set in Glasgow, which also means he can use his own accent at long last. “The script feels naturally how I would speak, and I haven’t felt that for a long, long time”.Getting to play Scottish in both Traces and The Nest has been a treat “I’m always chuffed to bits to get anything on screen that showcases part of Scotland”, he says. But, ultimately, AC-12 is never far from his mind. “I’m looking forward to getting back, putting the waistcoat on”, he laughs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba186b0401122a36ed4944f7ff74586220db967a/0_65_1936_1162/master/1936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=080e8f3ae06946511867b8a56c86bc7a","title":"afghanistan papers military washington post analysis","story":"The tranche of documents show that in trying to paint the best pictures, those involved delivered the worstDuring the Vietnam war, the daily US military briefings were known to journalists as the Five O’ Clock Follies, described by one of the AP reporters who attended them as “the longest-playing tragicomedy in south-east Asia’s theatre of the absurd”.The Pentagon Papers, the Department of Defense’s secret history of that war, leaked by Daniel Ellsberg in 1971, only underlined the level of that deception under subsequent US presidents.Now the Afghanistan Papers, published by the Washington Post after a three-year court battle, portrays a similar trajectory: of deliberate misinformation, wishful thinking, massaging of figures and cruel waste of lives – civilian and military – and a trillion dollars spent in pursuit of an unwinnable war.What is important in these hundreds of interviews – given by key US players to a US federal agency without the expectation their words would see the light of day – is the shocking and often granular candour, detailing how politicians, commanders and senior diplomats lied to themselves as they lied to US voters.And while much confirms what has already been available in memoirs, reporting and testimony to Congress, what is valuable in this collection of documents is the detail – and the depiction of how the biggest lies in conflict are an accumulation of bad faith, groupthink and cowardice.The documents also underline an important truth. While in conflict the metrics of success will always contested, when they are massaged so often and so cynically that they undermine the ability to see what is going on, as occurred in Vietnam, it is the setting for historic failure.Describing a “positivity bias” in reporting back to Washington, Flynn concluded that the “rosy picture” being painted across the board from the conflict was as corrupt as the theft that was also going on, and condemned a “lack of courage in senior government officials to tell the truth”.But set against that lack of progress, Flynn continued, was an institutional desire to report and to be the recipient of “good news”.“Commanders and policymakers, on the spectrum of news, they want always to be good news. Operational commanders, state department policymakers and Department of Defense policymakers are going to be inherently rosy in their assessments. They will be unaccepting of hard-hitting intelligence.”For Flynn, the problem was not reserved to the higher-ups, but inidual commanders at battalion and brigade level.“So the next guy that shows up finds it screwed up … they do their mission analysis once they are on the ground and then they come back and go, ‘Man, this is really bad.’“Truth was rarely welcome on the CAAT. Everyone just wanted to hear good news, so bad news was often stifled … when we tried to air larger strategic concerns about the willingness, capacity or corruption of the Afghan government it was clear it wasn’t welcome and the boss wouldn’t like it.”“Every data point,” he added, “was altered to present the best picture possible.”And in painting the best picture, those involved delivered the worst."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/764a918f0bd503aad3826a39b324f3cce424eb4a/581_0_5901_3540/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b1ac4ac2e00250d1ae8b140843b9c6","title":"eu trade deals must not contradict climate goals says mep","story":"Pascal Canfin says he cannot back deal with South American bloc owing to ‘political context’The EU’s trade deal with four South American countries will not be ratified in its current form because it contradicts Europe’s plans to confront the climate emergency, a leading MEP has said.Pascal Canfin, a Frenchman who chairs the European parliament’s environment committee, said he could not vote in favour of the EU trade deal with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay (the bloc known as Mercosur).“The Mercosur text will never be ratified by some national parliaments,” as it stands Canfin told the  in an interview. He said he could see no majority in the French national assembly for the agreement “as it is”, given the “political context with Bolsonaro”.Under Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, about two football pitches of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest are being lost every minute, the highest level of deforestation in a decade, pushing the country off track from its climate targets.Speaking before the launch of the EU’s “green deal” plan this Wednesday, Canfin said Europe’s trade deals could not contradict the bloc’s goals on climate action.“The EU is the first trade power in the world, so we have to use these trade deals in order to contribute to our vision of what is the right globalisation. And you can’t have climate action in one way and globalisation destroying climate,” he said.“I want to have it recorded I am not against trade deals and France is not against trade deals. But we need to take into account there is a massive change in expectations.”Any wide-ranging EU trade deal that strays into national government competence must be ratified by around 35 national and regional parliaments, as well as the European parliament.A leaked slideshow on the green deal shows that respecting the Paris climate agreement will be an “essential element of every future EU trade agreement”, although details are scant.The EU-Mercosur trade pact was agreed in June after two decades of stop-start negotiations, but in September as fires raged in the Amazon as a result of land clearance by farmers and developers, Emmanuel Macron threatened to block the deal.Although the pact includes a chapter intended to protect social and environmental standards, Canfin said it was not enough and the protections should be enforceable and legally binding.Canfin, a former head of WWF France, once sat as a Green MEP and returned to the European parliament in May under Macron’s Renew Europe banner, although he is not a member of Macron’s national party, La République En Marche.He was responsible for the text by which the European parliament declared a climate emergency last month, something he described as “a message to the rest of the world that Europe raises the bar”. He will play a role in shaping a raft of EU laws that will emanate from the green deal plan over the next five years, ning energy, farm subsidies and transport.Trade is just one piece of the plan, which is intended to transform the EU into a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050.According to the leaked slides seen by the , the plan includes:Speaking before the leaks emerged, Canfin said the plan had to ensure industry could go green and remain in Europe, to avoid losing factories to China and India.He stressed that green taxes should fund green policies, a lesson he drew from the gilets jaunes protests that were sparked by a fuel tax increase and morphed into a broader anti-Macron protest. “If the transition is not just and not perceived as just, we will not deliver, and that is exactly what happened in France with the carbon tax.”The EU has smashed previous carbon-cutting targets, partly by exporting emissions to China and other manufacturing centres in the far east. To get round this problem, Canfin is working with UK Liberal Democrat MEPs on a “global footprint target” that would assess how far the EU needs to reduce emissions based on its consumption of imported goods. This work in progress is not expected to feature in the green deal and Canfin said it was “way too early for concrete figures”.Another key ingredient will be overhauling Europe’s common agricultural policy, which props up the intensive farming that has fuelled pesticides pollution and a stunning decline in wildlife. Canfin said he wanted to maintain the €59bn annual CAP budget but redistribute it by capping the amount available to large landowners.He said farmers needed to be compensated for the more expensive cost of production if the EU restricted pesticides and fertilisers. “How could you argue that the EU ban pesticides in Europe and you have an extra cost for farmers, but you still accept imports with the very same pesticides – and you can’t compete?”The European parliament will co-legislate new farming rules and approve the final outcome in a plenary vote. “I can’t see how the CAP can get out of the plenary without strong greening of everything, but also making sure that there is more revenue for farmers, and that is the balance,” the MEP said.But he may face tricky negotiations with the parliament’s agriculture committee, where nearly half the members are farmers or have had farming interests at some point, according to research by Prof Alan Matthews, of Trinity College Dublin. The academic stressed his finding did not mean the MEP farmers shared a common view."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7244d9c8ad45451b0adfa75647b2f551f9dc9e7/0_59_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25f0cb3b4aad37ae4b94368034dbda1b","title":"nativity scene jesus mary joseph cages claremont","story":"Claremont United Methodist church installation shows Jesus, Mary and Joseph as caged immigrant familyA nativity installation depicting Mary, Joseph and Jesus separated in cages has caused a stir in a southern California city, a few hundred kilometers from the US border with Mexico.The installation shows Joseph and Mary, in separate cages, facing a cradled baby Jesus in a cage, with Joseph’s arms outstretched towards him.

Imagine Joseph and Mary separated at the border and Jesus no older than two taken from his mother and placed behind the fences of a Border Patrol detention center as more than 5,500 children have been the past three years,” said Ristine in the Facebook post.The nativity has drawn mixed reactions from locals in Claremont. “Karen, I am Methodist and your post is a clap in the face to me,” said one churchgoer on Ristine’s Facebook page, adding: “I can not put it any clearer, you are an ass.”“What about the ILLEGALS coming into this country and killing someone? The parents and that child are separated forever in this life … Horrible display,” said another.Others commended it. “Profound statement. Thank you for standing up for those who have no voice. This is not ‘using’ the nativity scene. This is a perfect artistic rendition of Jesus’s teachings. I’m truly grateful,” read one comment.It is not the first time the Claremont United Methodist church has made the news. In March, after the worldwide United Methodist church voted to maintain its opposition to same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ clergy, the Claremont church took out an ad in a local paper condemning the decision. “We stand in opposition to every denomination that excludes , marginalizes or devalues any group based on sexuality, race, culture, shape ability or language,” the advert said.The church has also previously put out a list of social principles in the Bible that are relevant to the current migration crisis.On Monday, a North Dakota county will vote on to decide whether to stop accepting refugees, the first local government vote since Donald Trump issued an executive order making it possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446bf777a6840d43aa958156669d7b479e6fe340/0_22_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f423772a5429e3eed046d49929129334","title":"swedish diplomat anna lindstedt faces trial for trying to free china dissident gui minhai","story":"Anna Lindstedt accused of brokering unauthorised meeting over fate of Gui MinhaiSweden’s former ambassador to Beijing is to go on trial for overstepping her duties by trying to negotiate the release of a Chinese-Swedish dissident held in China.Anna Lindstedt is accused of brokering an unauthorised meeting to try to get Gui Minhai freed, prosecutors said.Lindstedt, who is working as a foreign ministry official without an international posting, could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.The deputy chief prosecutor, Hans Ihrman, said ambassadors had “a far-reaching mandate to represent Sweden”. Nevertheless, he said, even ambassadors had to follow the guidelines set down by the foreign ministry and the government.“In this specific consular matter she has exceeded her mandate and has therefore rendered herself criminally liable,” Ihrman said.He said Lindstedt had been charged with arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power, a first in modern times.Relations between Sweden and China have been strained for several years over Gui’s detention.Gui, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen known for publishing gossipy titles about Chinese political leaders from a Hong Kong bookshop, disappeared from a holiday home in Thailand in 2015.Several months later he appeared on Chinese state television confessing to a fatal drink-driving accident from more than a decade earlier, and he went on to serve two years in prison. Three months after his release in October 2017, he was arrested again, this time on a train to Beijing while travelling with Swedish diplomats.His supporters and family have claimed his detention is part of a campaign of political repression orchestrated by Chinese authorities.According to Swedish prosecutors, Lindstedt organised a meeting in January between Gui’s daughter and businessmen with contacts to the Chinese state. The Swedish authorities opened their investigation the following month.Angela Gui, who has been campaigning for her father’s release, wrote in a Medium post in February that Lindstedt had invited her to Stockholm in January.During discussions in the lounges of a hotel in the Swedish capital, in the presence of Lindstedt, she was introduced to Chinese businessmen who claimed they could help secure her father’s release. In exchange, Angela Gui said, she was told to “stop all media engagement”.The Chinese embassy in Stockholm has said Beijing “has never authorised and will not authorise anyone to engage with Gui Minhai’s daughter”.Last month Sweden’s culture minister, Amanda Lind, defied a Chinese threat of “counter-measures” by presenting a Swedish rights prize awarded to Gui Minhai."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4104590.1575926952!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"here are 30 irish websites to get this year s christmas presents from","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome websites we were familiar with, but many more were completely new to us.Online shopping reached its annual peak last weekend with tens of millions of euro being spent on websites – the vast majority of which are based overseas.According to the people at auction website Ebay more than one million people went on a shopping splurge shop during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period, spending almost €150 million.Separately, PwC estimated that 33 per cent of Irish consumers shopped during the Black Friday-Cyber Monday period with an estimated 62 per cent of the shopping done online.The bulk of the money we spent online was with retailers who have only the most tenuous connections with Ireland.

Stop Climate Chaos head of policy Catherine Devitt said “2020 marks the beginning of a decade in which global emissions must reduce by 55 per cent before 2030 if the 1.5 degree limit in the Paris Agreement is to remain at all feasible”. Only decisive frontloading of policy decisions and action would ensure reductions of this scale could be delivered. “To fail to do so runs counter to the global and national public interest, threatening to significantly increase direct and indirect climate impacts, exacerbating global poverty, hunger, insecurity and population displacement, and risking global societal disruption or breakdown,” she added The EU’s fair share of the 1.5 degree-aligned global effort is at least 65 per cent reductions in emissions by 2030, she said. “Ireland has thus far failed, however, to align itself with even the least ambitious proposals of the Commission, and the eight member states who are calling for an increase in the EU’s 2030 reduction target to 55 per cent.”In a letter to Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton the Stop Climate Chaos coalition called on the Government at COP25 and upcoming council meetings, to align Ireland explicitly with EU Members calling for an increase of the EU’s 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target to at least 55 per cent compared to 1990 levels. “Further, we call on you to acknowledge unequivocally in your statements that even this is not commensurate with meeting the Paris temperature goals, that the EU and Ireland have significantly more to do to deliver their fair share of the global 2030 effort, and to commit to urgently increasing domestic ambition,” she said. Mr Bruton is due to attend the talks on Wednesday and to deliver Ireland’s national statement to the formal negotiations.The EU will not hesitate to impose measures to protect its industries from competitors who do not respect the Paris Agreement, said EU climate commissioner Frans Timmermans. Slow progressIn response to a question on the EU’s position on a possible “carbon tax” on imports from high-emitting competitors, Mr Timmermans said he hoped there would be no need to take such a step as the world moved to implement the agreement.“I hope then there will be no need for such a measure, but if it is necessary we will not hesitate to take it,” he said at a UN summit. Meanwhile, negotiations have been making slow progress and continue to be dominated by technical discussions on carbon trading issues rather than emissions reductions.Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at Union of Concerned Scientists, recalled in opening the summit UN secretary general António Guterres flagged the need for “a much more urgent response to the climate emergency than we’re now seeing, especially from the biggest emitting countries”. He added: “Over the last week, we haven’t seen negotiators rise to this challenge, especially when it comes to raising the ambition of emissions reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement and mobilising greater support for vulnerable countries and communities facing ever more devastating impacts of climate change.” Most vulnerable countries had joined a growing number of state and local governments, business leaders, investors and others – both in the US and around the world – in announcing ambitious climate commitments. “Sadly, the world’s biggest emitting countries, which account for all but 19 percent of global carbon emissions, have failed to take responsibility to do what’s required to stave off some of the worst impacts. These countries need to confirm their intentions to take such actions in 2020.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4109844.1575916702!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thunberg takes climate stance in solidarity with young indigenous people","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSweden’s Greta Thunberg (centre) with representatives of indigenous people  at the COP25 climate conference in Madrid, Spain. Photograph: Pablo Blazquez DominguezGetty ImagesGreta Thunberg turned a spotlight on the struggles of the world’s indigenous peoples when she appeared at the UN climate conference alongside young campaigners experiencing the consequences of an overheating world first-hand.The Swedish teenager, who arrived at COP25 in Madrid after crossing the Atlantic by catamaran, said she was availing of “some media attention” to give a voice to people whose stories needed to be listened to, including those from Africa and places where climate activism is actively suppressed.She stayed largely silent during her first official appearance at the summit to allow a young Native American, a Chilean, a Pacific islander, a Russian and a Filipino to speak. “Their rights are being violated across the world, and they are also among the ones being hit the most and the quickest by the climate and environmental emergency,” she said.Their testimonies indicated the emergency was not an issue for today’s children when they grow up, Ms Thunberg said. “People are suffering and dying from it today.”Rose Whipple of the Santee Dakota, native to Minnesota in the US, said: “The climate crisis is a spiritual crisis for our entire world. Our solutions must weave science and spirituality and traditional ecological knowledge with technology.” She described the decline of the Mississippi, a “sacred river that fed people for thousands of years”, and her people’s failed attempt to halt a Limetree oil pipeline in the courts. She said “the system continues to value corporate profit over indigenous lives”. Burning out“While countries congratulate each other for their weak commitments, the world is literally burning out,” said Chilean activist Angela Valenzuela. She said the people of Chile were not protesting about 30 pesos but 30 years of governments “that failed to protect us and fuelled the climate crisis for the benefit of a few”.She said it was unacceptable that the Chilean government came to COP25 to clean up its reputation when human rights violations were being committed every day.The low-lying Marshall Islands was the first nation to comply with a requirement in the Paris Agreement to scale-up its planned emissions reductions in 2018 – a move bigger emitters are under pressure to follow by next year.Carlon Zackhras, representing the atoll nation, said rising sea levels threatened his home, which is only two metres above the waterline. “We are having to deal with issues we did not create.”He said two weeks ago the island had its latest inundation, while infectious diseases such as dengue fever and measles were being made worse by global warming. “Migration is the only plan B.” Arshak Makichyan from Russia said a year ago he knew nothing about the climate crisis. When he heard Thunberg say “the world is on fire” he believed it was a metaphor. Seeing fires in the Amazon and Congo last summer proved otherwise. He has been arrested for protesting in solidarity with the global Fridays For Future movement and detained for a few days but that did not bother him. It was an action he expected to be repeated. He said people stood up against Adolf Hitler “who almost invaded the world”. “People stopped him for their children’s sake,” he said, suggesting a similar global effort was now needed to address the climate crisis. OceansThe Madrid meeting was supposed to be a “blue cop” to underline the importance of oceans, but negotiating nations had not brought the issue centre stage, said Kisha Erah Muana from the Philippines. As a consequence the colourful coral and rich marine life “is a playground I once knew” that no longer existed.At the conclusion of the briefing, Thunberg said indigenous people had lived in balance with nature for many hundreds of years, and had valuable knowledge that needed to be taken on board “in this crucial time of crisis”.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Advertising of e-cigarettes is to be restricted in order to limit the exposure of young people to them, Minister for Health Simon Harris has confirmed.Provision allowing for the banning of e-cigarette advertising near schools and creches, and on public transport, will be added to legislation planned for next year that will introduce a ban on sales of the products to under-18s, he said.Mr Harris was speaking at the launch of focus group research on flavoured e-cigarettes by the Irish Heart Foundation (IHF) and Irish Cancer Society, who allege these products are being marketed at teenagers by vaping companies.The two groups say e-cigarette companies are not telling the truth when they claim sweet flavours such as candyfloss and bubblegum are aimed at adults rather than children. The third- and fourth-year students who participated in focus groups for the research rejected the idea that e-cigarette companies do not design their advertising and packaging to attract children. The two health charities want restrictions on advertising and on flavoured products to be including in the upcoming legislation banning sales of e-cigarettes to under-18s.Mr Harris said he would look at the issue but warned there may be legal obstacles as well as issues around the definition of a flavoured product.But he said he was sure the reason the industry relied on flavoured products, often produced in colourful packaging, was to make their products attractive to children.Describing the matter as a major public health issue, he said tobacco companies, which now market many vaping products, were trying to “replenish” their customer base by “hooking” a new generation of Irish people to their products.Vape Business Ireland, which supports a ban on sales to under-18s, said it does not support a ban on flavours as they play an important role for adult smokers looking for an alternative product.“It is our view that vaping products are a product of choice for adults and should never be sold to those under 18. Therefore, marketing and advertising of vaping products should be socially responsible and directly only at adults,” said spokesman Joe Dunne.Focus groupsIn the research, young people in four mini focus groups were asked to comment on e-cigarette packaging and flavours shown to them. Categorising the products into four types of flavouring, they said only one, associated with existing tobacco products, could be expect to appeal to current smokers or those looking to quit. The other three were linked to food, fruits and sweets, and were considered to be appeal to young people as they were often found in the foods and drinks that appeal to them.“The fact that the only purpose of flavours like strawberry milkshake, cherry crush, chocolate mint and caramel is to lure a whole new generation of children into nicotine addiction has been endorsed resoundingly by the teenagers who took part in this research,” said Tim Collins, chief executive of the IHF.According to the report, 25 per cent of Irish 15-17-year-olds had tried e-cigarettes in 2015, while 11 per cent were current users.The children also highlighted the prominence of vaping on social media, at times promoted by influencers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4109958.1575921966!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"harris says murphy should pay back some of the expenses he claimed when in d%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Harris: “There are still functions whereby audits can be carried out and investigations can take place, and I’m sure that will happen”Former Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy should pay back some of the expenses he claimed during his time in the Dáil, Minister for Health Simon Harris has said. Mr Harris said the former Cork North Central Deputy, who resigned his Dáil seat last week, should return some of the expenses, but did not say exactly how much would be appropriate. Mr Murphy has been at the centre of a controversy about his non-attendance at Leinster House while claiming a Dáil salary and expenses. He has spent much of the last two years working with the European Peoples Party, to which Fine Gael is affiliated.He had the lowest attendance record of all 158 TDs before his resignation, and had not spoken in the Dáil for almost two years.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that if Mr Murphy is found to have claimed expenses incorrectly he should pay the money back.Mr Harris said on Tuesday that Mr Murphy should repay some of what he claimed.“I think he should, but I think before you and I decide what that level should be, I think it would be useful for somebody who’s not you or I to have a look at this.“And whilst he’s no longer a member of Dáil Éireann my understanding is that all expenses for any TD are still auditable for up to five years. All of us get that information every year when we make a declaration that says it’s auditable for up to five years even when you’re not a TD any longer. Previous year“And so I do know, for example, if you lost your seat in the general election you could still be audited for your expenses for the previous year you were a TD. So there are still functions whereby audits can be carried out and investigations can take place, and I’m sure that will happen.”The Dáil Members’ Interests Committee can conduct an investigation into Mr Murphy’s attendance, but only if the former Cork North Central Deputy requests an inquiry be carried out himself.While the Standards in Public Office Commission cannot pursue an investigation because Mr Murphy has resigned ahead of taking up a job in the European Commission, the committee can do so under the provisions of the 1995 Ethics Act if Mr Murphy asks it to do so.Members of the committee said they have yet to consider the matter."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4110021.1575926028!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rt%C3%A9 director to say a seven year wait for new broadcasting charge is untenable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRTÉ’s director general Dee Forbes is expected to tell the Oireachtas Communications Committee that RTÉ knows it must take action to remain “sustainable and relevant”A possible seven-year wait for a new broadcasting charge to replace the television licence fee is “untenable”, RTÉ’s director general is expected to tell an Oireachtas committee on Tuesday.The invitation for the executives to appear before the committee predated the national broadcaster’s recent announcement of a cost-cutting programme which envisages €55 million in cuts and up to 200 job losses.However, the announcement is expected to feature strongly at the committee hearing. The opening statement is expected to be delivered by Ms Forbes, although her name was not on the document sent to the Oireachtas committee. Earlier this year Minister for Communications Richard Bruton announced that the collection of the licence fee would be put out to tender, raising the prospect that An Post could lose the collection business. The successful bidder will be awarded a five-year contract. Once this period has elapsed, the licence fee will be replaced by a “device-independent broadcasting charge” designed to capture households consuming publicly-funded content on devices other than traditional television sets.Ms Forbes’s statement criticises this approach and furthers RTÉ arguments for rapid reform of the licence fee. She will say Mr Bruton has acknowledged the “importance” of protecting public service broadcasting.“He also acknowledged that the audiences were increasingly moving online for their media consumption, and that the licence fee system would need to adapt accordingly.“However, the remedy proposed was that the licence fee collection would be put out to tender, and that the term of contract would be for a five-year period. Given that the collecting agent would likely be contracted from 2021 onward, this would in effect delay the transition to a media charge for close to seven years from the point of announcement. HouseholdsMs Forbes blamed “outdated legislation” for the fact that many households do not pay the annual €160 fee but can still consume public service programming on online devices. “That is completely untenable. Evasion is now almost 13 per cent, resulting in the loss of €25 million per year,” she will say. “Ireland’s TV licence system is irrevocably broken, and is no longer capable of properly sustaining public service broadcasting or Ireland’s broader audio-visual and creative sector.”However, she said that RTÉ knows it must take action to remain “sustainable and relevant”. “RTÉ has made significant changes to the organisation in recent years, but the way that media is being consumed by audiences everywhere is changing, and we need to evolve if we are to meet our audience needs effectively.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4109966.1575922031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk campaign trail tories target marginal welsh seat as brexit ruptures party lines","story":"The Liberal Democrats held seat in Brecon and Radnorshire is a major target for the Conservative party in the upcoming UK election. Video: Enda O’Dowd Aside from the breath-catching scenery, two things stand out driving from England into the Welsh constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire: the Tories really want to win here and some people really want to stop them.Election posters promoting first-time Tory candidate Fay Jones line hedgerows, far more than is usual in a rural constituency like this. Approaching Brecon from Hertfordshire, a large number of Conservative posters have been defaced in this Liberal Democrat-held constituency. One was covered with a red spray-painted “No”.This constituency has flipped between Conservatives and Liberals since 1979 Labour does not figure here in general elections.On a chilly, wind-swept Sunday morning in Bronllys – a village on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, a national park and a hillwalkers’ utopia – Jones is a little apprehensive as a middle-aged man approaches.She is canvassing the village in a final push for votes ahead of Thursday’s general election.“Are you the Conservative candidate?” the man asks the 34-year-old political lobbyist from Cardiff who previously worked for Prince Charles.She is, she tells him.He holds out his hand to shake hers and says he will be voting for her.Not all people have been so pleasant in this campaign. Jones had intruders in her garden at home while she was away who ripped out campaign signs.“That’s a bit scary,” she said. The police have been “absolutely fantastic”.“It is very unsettling particularly as I live on my own,” she told The .Canvassers do not go out alone during this election.“Temperatures are a bit high, so I think the sooner we get this election out of the way, the better,” she said.This marginal Welsh constituency is roughly the size of Luxembourg and the biggest by area in England and Wales. Sheep outnumber people in these hilly parts by about 10 to 1.It is a key Conservative target as Johnson aims to win a parliamentary majority with a pledge to deliver Brexit. That message should play well in an area that voted marginally (52 per cent) to leave the EU.Sheared a sheepBrecon is high on Johnson’s list. He passed through here last month and sheared a sheep at an agricultural fair he attended with Jones. She knows Johnson well, having co-ordinated his leadership campaign in Wales.The constituency has not been good to him. In August, voters here cut his majority in parliament to one in a byelection when Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds overturned a 8,038 majority to beat Conservative MP Chris Davies by 1,425 votes. The election was called after Davies was convicted for submitting a false expenses claim.Jones appears to have drawn a line under that controversy. On paper, she has a very strong chance of becoming the first female Conservative MP elected from Wales. The Brexit Party, which won 3,331 votes in the byelection, stood down in this constituency, so the Tories, promising Brexit, will be the likely beneficiaries.Even in a marginal Brexit remain-leave constituency, Jones, who voted to stay in the EU, believes that some remainers will back her as they want to conclude the UK’s labyrinthine exit from the bloc.“I am finding so many people like me, who voted remain, who just want to see it delivered, who want to make progress, who are sick and tired of the fact that we have wasted 3½ years,” she said.“I am finding that it is pretty overwhelmingly a leave constituency now.”Voter fatigue, over Brexit and elections in general, could suppress turnout, which makes this close race even more unpredictable. One electoral area, Brecon St Mary’s, has had nine elections since 2017.Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, dismisses the Tory promise to deliver Brexit quickly. Standing on the banks of the river Usk, the Lib Dem says that only stopping Brexit “will happen overnight”.“The Conservatives are very dishonest when they say get Brexit done because it won’t get done. It absolutely won’t and Brexit will continue to dominate our media, our politics for time immemorial,” she said.Dodds hopes she can benefit again, as she did in the byelection, from the “remain alliance” with Plaid Cymru and the Greens pulling out to send an anti-Brexit MP back to Westminster.“The small parties have to work together. It is about adult grown-up politics in this first-past-the-post system. We all want it to change, so that we can have a much better voting system. But until then, and for this election, what we are saying is that we are going to be working together,” she said.“It is absolutely critical if people want to stop Brexit, that they vote Liberal Democrats and we get more remain MPs in order to have a second referendum.”In Brecon, this election has left voters conflicted by Brexit’s rupturing of traditional party allegiances.Voted tactically“I don’t want to be a tactical voter. I want to vote with my heart,” said Labour supporter and remainer Gillian Beedle who voted tactically in 2010 for the Lib Dems but then “they jumped into bed with the Tories”.Wandering around Brecon’s Toy \u0026amp Train Sale in the town’s market hall with her husband and son, she says she comes from a former mining town in the north of England and is “vehemently against the Tories”.“I have voted tactically in the past and it has not worked out well. I said I would never do it again for that reason,” she said.She despairs that Labour doesn’t get a look-in here – and about politics in general.“The whole political system in the UK at the minute is a mess. The situation we are in with Brexit is a mess. I don’t know how it is ever going to be sorted out,” she said.In Bronllys, friends Dawn Murray and Deb Ballinger stroll through the village early on Sunday morning. They differ politically both on Brexit and on this election.Murray voted to leave the EU and has already backed Jones by postal vote Ballinger is a remainer and is voting liberal on Thursday. They are out delivering Christmas cards to neighbours to save on stamps and “to show how united we are”, says Murray with a laugh.Not all friends, or even families, are so close. In this ided area, Murray knows of older remainer farmers whose children are leavers. Ballinger says she has a Brexiteer friend who has fallen out with his remainer son.The two women try to rise above the Brexit ide.“As friends maybe all with different opinions and with feet in the camps of all the parties, we are trying not to let it interfere with how we discuss politics,” said Murray.“It is only a small part of life, Brexit.”Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

She has asked people not to like or share these videos online.Her institute for primate care argues that the internet and social media are perpetuating the illegal sale of primates and killingpoaching them from the wild and that it perpetuates the idea that chimpanzees are not endangered.Will Travers, the president of the Born Free foundation, added: “What we need are positive images of wildlife, set with the in the context of their natural environment wherever possible or, of rescued animals in captivity with an appropriate explanation.So, for example, the primates (not great apes) at Born Free USA’s Primate Sanctuary or the big cats at Born Free’s Rescue centres in Ethiopia or South Africa, or even the rescued chimpanzees in Ngamba Island, Uganda. The days of chimps tea parties and boxing orangutans are well and truly over.Wildlife news is so often deeply depressing, brutal, negative, that is why I am so delighted to be a judge of the Comedy Wildlife Awards, which allow us to smile, along with nature, not at it.”Yvonne Taylor, the Director of Corporate Projects at Peta, said: By banning images of captive great apes in unnatural situations, Moonpig has made a huge difference for non-human primates, both in the wild and in captivity. We hope other card manufacturers follow the company\u0027s compassionate lead.How Boris Johnson\u0026#39s media friendly tour of the North took a chaotic turn Golden Globes nominations 2020: Netflix dominates in film and TV \u0026#39Hundreds of entrepreneurs\u0026#39 ready to leave Britain if Jeremy Corbyn wins electionComment: Another hung parliament would offer only permanent chaos and instabilityJeremy Corbyn could win without gaining a seat, say Tories as they warn he is closer to election success than people think Boris Johnson brands BBC licence fee a \u0026#39tax\u0026#39 as he raises prospect it could be abolishedChildren are three times less likely to be arrested than eight years ago, police figures showWatchdog finds no \u0026#39political bias\u0026#39 in launch of Trump Russia probeSaudi pilot who attacked US Navy base had lodged complaint over \u0026#39pornstache\u0026#39 jibeComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s insane economic agenda would lead to calamity for the many, not the fewComment: Sadly for Labour, Jeremy Corbyn just doesn’t wow the crowds like he used toWatching \u0026#39unboxing\u0026#39 videos online could benefit children, suggests Cambridge University psychologist Jeremy Corbyn snubbed by own shadow cabinet as 9 in 10 campaign leaflets make no mention of himLabour risks becoming \u0026#39useful idiot\u0026#39 for Russia over leaked documents, warns Facebook ex-security chief Athletes don\u0026#39t just have better bodies, their brains work better too, study findsRSPB accused of \u0026#39blatant\u0026#39 attempt to damage grouse shooting in Scotland ahead of crucial reviewAnorexia deaths not being properly recorded by NHS, inquest hearsComment: Boris Johnson will not get Brexit done properly without the Brexit Party in ParliamentWill tactical voting work in the 2019 election?

She will then likely be detained while awaiting trial.She was born in France but moved to UK capital as a child and had British residency.A source close to the family told The  they were upset by the UK\u0027s decision to refuse her return.Her kids most certainly will go into foster care away from her and any of her family in Britain,” said the source.Tooba Gondal, known as the \u0026#39Islamic State matchmaker\u0026#39 pictured before leaving for Syria in 2015Ms Gondal has been accused of acting as an online recruiter and “matchmaker” for the terrorist group by luring women to Syria to marry Isil fighters. Among them was reportedly Bethnal Green schoolgirl Shamima Begum.She used social media to post images of herself wearing a burqa and holding an assault rifle.In October, Ms Gondal told the  how she managed to escape from Ain Issa camp with her two infant children, along with hundreds of other foreign suspected Isil women in a mass prison break after Turkey launched its offensive.She expressed a desire to be sent to the UK or Turkey.“I want to go home, see my family,” the former Goldsmiths, University of London, student said via WhatsApp messages. “But if I am not able, I want to seek refuge in Turkey.Married and widowed three times while living in Isil’s “caliphate”, she was banned from re-entering the UK last November by a Home Office exclusion order, but her three-year-old son is entitled to citizenship because of his British father.However, her 18-month-old daughter\u0027s late father was Russian.Last month, Turkey stepped up the return of suspected foreign Isil members - either held in Turkish prisons or in Syria - back to their countries of origin, saying Turkey was not a hotel for foreign fighters.The Turkish interior ministry on Monday confirmed it had sent 11 French relatives of suspected terrorist fighters back home.According to CAT, one of the deported women was Amandine Le Coz, who had been married to a Moroccan militant killed in Syria. She joined Isil with her husband in 2014.The French foreign ministry and interior ministry declined to comment.The mother-of-two, seen here with a Kalashnikov, was denied return to the United Kingdom with her childrenTurkey stepped up its deportation of foreign fighters after criticism from Western countries, in particular, France, over its military offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria.The move has created a conundrum for European governments over how to manage the return of radicalised militants, some of them battle-hardened.Britain, which has taken one of the strongest stances against the return of its nationals, has deprived many of them of their citizenship.Under a 2014 accord between France and Turkey, Paris agreed to take back jihadists trying to return home from Syria via Turkey and incarcerate them at home. Some 300 French nationals have been thus returned in the past five years.However, France is keen on foreign suspects being sent for trial near to their place of arrest - notably Iraq, where several of its nationals have recently been handed death sentences.America last month clashed with Europe over the issue, with Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, insisting they needed to “hold them to account”.Coalition members must take back the thousands of foreign terrorist fighters in custody and impose accountability for the atrocities they have perpetrated, he said in a meeting of the international coalition against Isil in Washington DC.Ankara says it has around 1,200 foreign Isil members in custody.There are understood to be around 10 British men, 20 women and 30 children, currently detained in Kurdish-run camps and prisons around north-east Syria.The Case of Sally Challen, review: a meticulous look at one of the most surreal casesHow Boris Johnson\u0026#39s media friendly tour of the North took a chaotic turn Jeremy Corbyn could win without gaining a seat, say Tories as they warn he is closer to election success than people thinkGolden Globes nominations 2020: Netflix dominates in film and TV \u0026#39Hundreds of entrepreneurs\u0026#39 ready to leave Britain if Jeremy Corbyn wins electionComment: Another hung parliament would offer only permanent chaos and instability Boris Johnson brands BBC licence fee a \u0026#39tax\u0026#39 as he raises prospect it could be abolishedChildren are three times less likely to be arrested than eight years ago, police figures showWatchdog finds no \u0026#39political bias\u0026#39 in launch of Trump Russia probeSaudi pilot who attacked US Navy base had lodged complaint over \u0026#39pornstache\u0026#39 jibeComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s insane economic agenda would lead to calamity for the many, not the fewComment: Sadly for Labour, Jeremy Corbyn just doesn’t wow the crowds like he used toWatching \u0026#39unboxing\u0026#39 videos online could benefit children, suggests Cambridge University psychologist Jeremy Corbyn snubbed by own shadow cabinet as 9 in 10 campaign leaflets make no mention of himLabour risks becoming \u0026#39useful idiot\u0026#39 for Russia over leaked documents, warns Facebook ex-security chief Athletes don\u0026#39t just have better bodies, their brains work better too, study findsRSPB accused of \u0026#39blatant\u0026#39 attempt to damage grouse shooting in Scotland ahead of crucial reviewAnorexia deaths not being properly recorded by NHS, inquest hearsComment: Boris Johnson will not get Brexit done properly without the Brexit Party in ParliamentWill tactical voting work in the 2019 election?

It is going to be a first class, a premium economy-type style and economy.He said passengers in premium economy could be entitled to the bigger seat, better wi-fi and snacks rather than a meal.Britain has not had three tiers of seats on its trains since 1956, when trains had first class, second class and third class.It is not known how much the new middle tier of fares would cost.Matthew Gregory, chief executive of FirstGroup, which joint-owns the franchise with Italian firm Trenitalia, said the change in policy is about balancing and being flexible within the train.He went on: Obviously first class can be quite expensive, so there are different price points between standard class and first class and it is about seeing if we can offer a more flexible offering that suits more price points.It is likely that the new tickets will come into play when the Pendolino trains inherited from Virgin are upgraded.First Rail managing director Steve Montgomery described the 56 trains the company inherited from Virgin Trains as “tired”.The firm has promised to significantly improve the carriages used with a £117 million refurbishment of the Pendolinos and replacing Super Voyagers with new trains.There will be 25,000 new seats, more reliable wi-fi and improved catering. The revamp of the trains is likely to happen by autumn 2020, and the new trains will be on the line by 2022.FirstGroup reportedly considered introducing three classes on west coast services in its ill-fated 2012 bid for the franchise.A year later, the Department for Transport was forced to deny it was planning to require a third-class service to be introduced on the East Coast Main Line, after a three-tier system was included in a leaked franchise prospectus ahead of a return to private ownership.Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61, told the PA news agency: When it comes to intercity travel, there does seem to be scope for having some extra classes, but it depends what they\u0027re doing and how they\u0027re doing it.Cross-Channel rail operator Eurostar offers three classes of travel.The middle class, named Standard Premier, entitles ticket holders to a larger seat where they are served a light meal and drinks.How Boris Johnson\u0026#39s media friendly tour of the North took a chaotic turn Jeremy Corbyn could win without gaining a seat, say Tories as they warn he is closer to election success than people thinkGolden Globes nominations 2020: Netflix dominates in film and TV \u0026#39Hundreds of entrepreneurs\u0026#39 ready to leave Britain if Jeremy Corbyn wins electionComment: Another hung parliament would offer only permanent chaos and instability Boris Johnson brands BBC licence fee a \u0026#39tax\u0026#39 as he raises prospect it could be abolishedChildren are three times less likely to be arrested than eight years ago, police figures showWatchdog finds no \u0026#39political bias\u0026#39 in launch of Trump Russia probeSaudi pilot who attacked US Navy base had lodged complaint over \u0026#39pornstache\u0026#39 jibeComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s insane economic agenda would lead to calamity for the many, not the fewComment: Sadly for Labour, Jeremy Corbyn just doesn’t wow the crowds like he used toWatching \u0026#39unboxing\u0026#39 videos online could benefit children, suggests Cambridge University psychologist Jeremy Corbyn snubbed by own shadow cabinet as 9 in 10 campaign leaflets make no mention of himLabour risks becoming \u0026#39useful idiot\u0026#39 for Russia over leaked documents, warns Facebook ex-security chief Athletes don\u0026#39t just have better bodies, their brains work better too, study findsRSPB accused of \u0026#39blatant\u0026#39 attempt to damage grouse shooting in Scotland ahead of crucial reviewAnorexia deaths not being properly recorded by NHS, inquest hearsComment: Boris Johnson will not get Brexit done properly without the Brexit Party in ParliamentWill tactical voting work in the 2019 election?

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable.

Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed.

She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa.

No other film has reflected society in the 21st century more succinctly. AWA magical reprieve from much of the queer romance canon,Barry Jenkins is destined to be one of the most important cinematicCLRobert De Niro, Lupita Nyong’o and Adam Sandler have had setbacksThe recent groundswell of support for Nyong’o and Sandler, both of whom did career-best work in Us and Uncut Gems, respectively, didn’t pay off at the Globes. But while it is likely not a fantastic sign about their Oscar chances, neither film is exactly Golden Globes-friendly movies. All hope may not be lost.The true puzzler, and potentially a grim sign for Oscar night, is the absence of Robert De Niro. The Irishman walked away with five nominations, including Best Supporting Actor his his co-stars Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, so it is curious that the star of the film wasn’t also in the mix.Cats may be awfulMystery has surrounded Cats for the last couple of weeks, amid speculation that it may not have been finished in time to screen for voters at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. But according to Variety, it did manage to screen at the last minute, meaning that its lack of major nominations here may be a gloomy indication of its quality.Cats walked away with a single nomination, for Best Original Song, but was otherwise entirely snubbed – a surprise considering how often the Globes throw nominations at high-profile musicals. It also likely means that Jennifer Hudson’s already heavily-memed performance as Grizabella may not be the secret standout of 2019.No love for Little Women, or women in generalLittle Women is one of the most eagerly anticipated films of the Christmas season, and has had glowing reviews, so its relative absence from nominations is a bummer. Star Saoirse Ronan received the film’s single acting nod, with Alexander Desplat taking home a nomination for Best Original Score. Florence Pugh, who had emerged in recent weeks as a major Best Supporting Actress contender, was a major snub.Its absence is also the most notable snub of a number of films and mini-series directed by women this year, with the likes of Lulu Wang (The Farewell), Ava DuVernay (When They See Us), Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood) and Lorene Scafaria (Hustlers)\u0026nbspalso snubbed. The Best Picture categories were similarly noticeably absent of films solely led by female characters, even if they received nominations in other categories.\u0026nbspBombshell,\u0026nbspJudy,\u0026nbspHarriet, Booksmart,\u0026nbspHustlers and\u0026nbspThe Farewell\u0026nbspall earned love in acting categories, but could not break through elsewhere.Game of Thrones got massively snubbedConsidering it is somewhat tradition to reward a long-running and culture-shaking TV series with the Best Drama award after their final season, the absence of Game of Thrones here came as a surprise. Albeit a not outrageous surprise, considering the risible response to much of the show’s final season.But with Kit Harington the show’s sole nomination, it’s a bit of a damp squib for the show to go out on.The Golden Globes still love the BritsWhatever fears Netflix may have had about retiring the entire cast of The Crown for its third season, replacing them with the likes of Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter, will have been allayed by the strong showing here for The Crown. Both stars earned nominations, along with actor Tobias Menzies and one nod for Best Drama Series.America’s love affair with Fleabag also continued, with Andrew Scott’s nomination implying that voters haven’t just been charmed by Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s cheery British ebullience, but actually enjoyed the show she wrote, too.Important people have watched The Morning ShowApple TV+ may not have been enormously satisfied with the tepid response to their flagship drama series The Morning Show, but the Hollywood Foreign Press Association were clearly watching. The new streaming service only launched in November, but can already say they’re responsible for at least one Golden Globe-nominated drama, with the show picking up three nominations – two for stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and one for Best Drama Series.While nominations for Booksmart’s Beanie Feldstein and Knives Out stars Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas were lovely surprises, the inclusion of Cate Blanchett (nominated for Best Actress for Where’d You Go, Bernadette) is slightly baffling. True to form, the Globes prioritised the optics of a famous face at their ceremony rather than the performance itself.Blanchett is fine in the film, a much-delayed adaptation of the Maria Semple book, but it earned horrible reviews and dismal box office takings upon release in August. It also remains without UK distribution – which may now change in light of its nomination.The 2020 Golden Globe Awards, presented by Ricky Gervais, will take place on 5 January.Follow along below to see what happened as the. nominations were announcedFind a full list of nominations\u0026nbsphere.Martin Scorsese\u0027s The Irishman is a strong favourite for the Best Film category\u0026nbsp– despite Robert De Niro snubRicky Gervais will host the ceremony for the fifth and final timeAre you ready for awards season to begin?

Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM741 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney. GMThe horrors of Ari Aster’s occult contraption are matchedKirsten Dunst is remarkable as a bride in the grips ofAWSelma is a masterclass in the historical biopic. Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1841 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken. GMDescribed upon release as a lightly fictionalised accountAWIt’s important to occasionally remind yourself thatAWRoma takes two stories – one heartwrenching and intimate, the other sweeping and political – and weaves them together so delicately that they become one. It’s a tribute to the domestic worker who director Alfonso Cuarón says raised him. But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2341 18. The Act of KillingIt feels remarkable, given how easy it is to turn away from evil,CLPark Chan-Wook’s twisted homage to Hitchcock’s Shadow of a DoubtCLLike Ken Loach’s Kes, Clio Barnard’s Bradford-set tale, very loosely inspired by the Oscar Wilde story, combines lyricism with polemic. It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift. GM2641 15. Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)AWWes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3141 11. Under the SkinScarlett Johansson tucking nervously into a slice ofAW20th Century Women is a small-scale comedy drama with the power of something bigger.

Instagram doesn\u0027t offer the feature, however, so you will have to go elsewhere.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThankfully, you don\u0027t have to pick through all your pictures and find out the best ones: there\u0027s plenty of websites available to do that for you. The best one appears to be topnine.co, which includes some extra features like the ability to see how many likes you managed to get over the entire year.Last year, that site ran into issues\u0026nbspin some countries, such as the UK,\u0026nbspperhaps because of more stringent privacy rules. Those seem to have been fixed this time.But if there are problems, you can still head\u0026nbspto the 2019bestnine site\u0026nbspas an alternative. It\u0027s not quite as neat, runs quite slowly and sticks a fairly ugly watermark on the bottom, but it includes some clever features, such as the ability to choose any date range that you like.Whichever one you use, just head to that site, give it your username, and it\u0027ll sort everything out from there. You can even give it someone else\u0027s username, should you want to see their best nine.​Instagram\u0027s latest update forces new users to reveal their ageThe site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.​The feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back.

I just speak about the s*** we all see. That’s why your vote matters.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the track, the east-London rapper urges the elderly to listen to their grandchildren and vote on their behalf.“F*** how you wanna live now, this is about how you wanna move forward,” he raps. “All you OAPs out there, who are probably gonna die in the next 10 years anyway, why don’t you ask your 1516 year-old grandkids who they’d vote for if they could and go vote for them.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 50 best albums of the decade – 2010 to 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars.

(RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard.

The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain.

He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. “Your generation’s already f***ed up the environment for them,” he continues. “How about not f***ing up their futures for them as well?”Plan B concludes with summing up what a vote for each party would entail.“Vote Tory if you wanna be free from European influence and become the 51st state of the US when it comes to trading,” he raps. “Or vote Labour and have another referendum on whether we leave the EU now that everyone’s more informed about the situation.Dua Lipa urges followers to vote Labour in 2019 general electionKano and Steve Coogan among 40 cultural figures backing LabourChris Martin says he’ll ‘probably’ vote for Lib Dems in electionHe continues, “If you’re worried about Jeremy stifling wealth creation and don’t wanna vote for Boris because you f***ing hate him, then vote Lib Dem in the constituencies they have a realistic stake in. “Or the Green Party, I hear some of you shouting.”Listen to “First Past the Post” here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even if height and BMI remained static, demand for food is forecast to surge. But a further 20 per cent rise in demand will be due to the greater quantity of food required by larger humans.Professor Stephan Klasen and doctoral student Lutz Depenbusch investigated how rapid changes recorded in the Netherlands and in Mexico could provide a benchmark for changing patterns around the world.\u0026nbspIn Mexico BMIs have risen sharply, while in the Netherlands, average heights have increased. Dutch men now have an average height of 183cm (6ft), an increase of 13.1cm between 1914 and 2014.“The developments in these countries are very pronounced,” said Dr Depenbusch, “but they do represent a realistic scenario.”If global food production does not meet this increased need, the researchers fear this problem will not be controlled by a corresponding decrease in BMI. While richer people will be able to maintain their eating habits, the poor would suffer greatly from higher prices due to increased demand.\u0026nbsp“This would lead to increased consumption of cheap food, often rich in calories but poor in nutrients,” said Dr Depenbusch.\u0026nbsp“As a result, body weight among the poor would continue to rise alongside malnutrition and poorer health outcomes.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These increases would particularly affect Sub-Saharan African countries, which will already face massively rising calorie requirements due to the high population growth.”In the UK, men and women have both seen an average height increase of 11cm over the last century, with an average man now standing 178cm (5ft 10in) tall, while women are 161cm (5ft 3 in).\u0026nbspMexico has the second-highest BMI in the world, after the USA, but changes have happened in Mexico more rapidly.Until the 1980s malnutrition was the biggest dietary issue in Mexico, but by 2010, seven out of ten Mexicans were overweight, with a third clinically obese.As of 2012, diabetes – associated with obesity – was the largest single killer of Mexicans.The study is published in the journal PLOS ONE.University of Gottingen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We don’t do road bikes, as too dangerous,” he said.\u0026nbsp“I was hit by a truck and almost died on one when I was 17.”Mr Musk has consistently said that electric vehicles are needed in every vehicle category in order to solve sustainable energy, with the Cybertruck and ATV part of his attempts to fulfill this.Despite the mishap during the Cybertruck’s unveiling – when two armoured windows were smashed by a metal ball – Tesla’s latest model has proved to be one of the most popular all-electric vehicles of all time.Within one week of the truck’s unveiling it had racked up more than 250,000 pre-orders and generated more than $25 million worth of down payments.It may still be years away from launch but it was recently spotted driving on public roads in Howthorne, California.The electric ATV shares the same futuristic design as the Cybertruck and is built to be transported and charged on the bed of the truck.Pre-orders are not yet available for the Cyberquad and it is still not listed on Tesla’s website.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But how can you not have a table How do you eat  Where do you have coffee  What do you put your shopping on when you come home  And where do you sityou want to read something  Which brings me on to another astonishing fact. Today, in Britain, , children do not own a single book.Obviously, I’m aware that children would much rather shoot an alien in the face than read some drivel by Jane Austen. And I get that. I’d rather gouge my own eyes out with a trowel than read anything by Jane Austen. And I’d certainly rather play Call Of Duty.I’ll admit, too, that book people spend far too much time being bookish and earnest with other book people. Which is why the book that wins the Booker Prize is always more impenetrable than a Hawthorn bush.It’s usually just a lot of women wondering about flowers. Have I read either of this year’s joint winners  No. I’d rather eat my own sick. But the idea of living in a house with no books at all is actually quite frightening.Because then there’d be no Winnie The Pooh, and more worryingly, no Jack Reacher.They’ve tried to capture the essence of this man mountain on television and, hilariously, with Tom Cruise in the role at the cinema, but nothing beats the books. They’re all the same. Jack walks into a small town in America. He has some coffee. Notices a pretty girl. Punches eight men in the face. Sleeps with the pretty girl. Saves the town from the baddies by punching them all in the face and then walks off at the end.I swear to God thatyou could get your kids to put down their phones for a day, and read a Jack Reacher book, they’d never want to do social media again. I know that’s impossible. I know you can’t get a kid to put down its phone for more than  seconds. I’m just saying thatyou could . . .So what about school  Kids are made to read by teachers, but the books they select are always as dull as being dead. Andyou make kids read boring books for exams, they will grow up to hate reading.So ditch Austen and Donne and Shakespeare and Milton. Put them on the top shelf of a library and leave them there. Instead, to make reading fun, make them study Jack Reacher and books by Jilly Cooper and Jeffrey Archer.Even EL Jamesthat’s what it takes. Anything that gets them reading. Anything that makes books cool. It won’t work for everyone of course. Some kids will not enjoy a book no matter how good the story might be.But that’s OK. They can go off and do carpentry instead. Then they could make the family a table.APPARENTLY,  people complained about a raunchy appearance by the Pussycat Dolls on last weekend’s X Factor final.Some say the performance was “shameful” while others said the “strip show” was “absolutely disgraceful”.I couldn’t agree more. We sat through a rubbish song and at the end, they were wearing exactly the same amount of clothing as they had been at the start.But almost all of them these days are NEVER seen in public without a phone in one hand and . . . a plastic bottle of water in the other.I don’t know when it became compulsory to have water about your person at all times, but it’s stupid.Yes. You need wateryou are in the desert and you’re hundreds of miles from a tap and it’s C.But at all other times, you should drink beer.Because that comes in a glass bottle that doesn’t end up wrapped round some poor unfortunate sea creature’s head.AFTER about three hours my back bottom went to sleep but the rest of me was still gripped by Martin Scorsese’s new epic, The Irishman.Mostly, however, I was gripped by how badly the phenomenally expensive de-ageing technology works.It’s used in flash- backs to turn ageing stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino into younger men but it makes them look like Bill and Ben.And their plastic faces are at odds with their elderly bodies.Pity. I was rather hoping we could use tech like this in the next Grand Tour to make me look like Charles Leclerc.It’s reckoned that David has climbed  places in the list of most popular boys’ names thanks to the work done by David Attenborough.Really. But what about those who are naming their kids after David Cameron, or David Jason Or even the popular television channel.That’s what I’d doI had another kid.Call it Amazon. Good name actually.I SEE Q Branch has fitted James Bond’s rebuilt Aston Martin DB with mini guns that pop out from behind the headlights.That’s excellent, as a brace of these fearsome weapons can fire , rounds a minute. That’s  every second.The trouble is, that they can’t. I once flew a helicopter that had been fitted with miniguns on its skids and every time I pulled the trigger, one bullet would set off in the wrong direction and then the gun would jam.There’s another issue too. If Bond’s car carries enough bullets for two minutes of sustained fire, he’d need , bullets. Which together would weigh around ,lb. Oh, and the ammo storage box would be huge, too.These, then, are weapons that only really work on the screen. When they’re not actually firing anything at all.ELDERLY residents in the seaside town of Bournemouth started a petition as soon as they heard that a “pot shop” was due to open in their community.They said: “The area already struggles massively with anti-social behaviour and the last thing the community needs is an establishment promoting the use of narcotics right opposite impressinable youngsters.”Couple of things on that. They spelled “impressionable” wrong. And more importantly, the pot shop that had got them so riled was going to sell . . . pottery.This is a bit like that story from a while ago where angry locals daubed slogans and smashed windows of the house of the local paediatrician.Because they thought the brass plaque on the door said “paedophile”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not true this time: it is the MOST IMPORTANT VOTE in our letimes.At stake is whether we leave the EU or not. You may think that was settled by the Brexit referendum — and it should have been. But any result other than a Tory majority will lead to more efforts to overturn the referendum result.It will mean another year when politicians argue about whether to accept what people voted for in June , rather than focusing on schools, hospitals and all the other domestic issues that matter so much.There are TWO POSSIBLE RESULTS in this election: a Tory majority or another hung Parliament. Even John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, is talking about how Labour would try to governit didn’t have a majority.Another hung Parliament would be more of the same: Parliamentary gridlock and no progress. What would a Parliament without a majority for any party be able to agree on beyond a second referendum It is not even certain it could do that. You would need a government for a second referendum and Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said she would rather have another election than put either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn into No.So we may well all be heading to the polls AGAIN in Februarythere is no clear result this time. Eventhey could unite on a second referendum, they wouldn’t be able to agree on much . It would be a single-issue government, to the detriment of everything .When Labour make extravagant promises it has a double credibility problem. First, how will it pay for them  It is not realistic to say you can fund spending equivalent to half an NHS every year just by taxing the rich and big business a bit more.Second, will they actually happen given that Labour won’t win a majority  In a hung Parliament, Labour will only be able to do those things that Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats agree to.By contrast, a Tory majority government would not be more of the same. It would break the Brexit deadlock. This country would leave on January . This will not settle the question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it will mean that Brexit won’t continue to suck up all of Parliament’s energies.A majority government is also more easily held to account. If the Tories win one, then at the next election voters will be able to seethey have delivered on what they said that would do: There will  be no excuses and no hiding places. Right now, the Tories are on course for a majority. I understand their own internal numbers indicate a working majority.But these margins are very fine, and victory could slip awayvoters don’t turn out. If Boris Johnson does win a majority next week, it will be because he has presented himself as change. Not just the person who can break the deadlock, but a leader with a dferent agenda to the one the Tories have had these past nine years.As Prime Minister of a majority government, he would have to deliver on that agenda. He would have to create the conditions for the economy to flourish far outside London and the South East, he would have to improve the NHS and our infrastructure.Having been elected as a dferent kind of Tory, he will have to govern as that. This country has been in limbo for too long. It needs a Parliament that can take decisions, not just play for time.According to one campaign source: “There is still a nervousness about letting it run wild.”But there is a recognition that the Tories  need a bit of pizzazz in the last few days and that Boris  needs, “the energy of a walkabout”.The Tory plan is to “close hard”. They are, privately, cautiously optimistic.One Cabinet minister says: “In  you could feel it slipping away, it doesn’t feel like that this time.”But they have held back nearly all their online advertising budget for the last few days to guard against any last-minute swing back to Labour.FEW expected Donald Trump to be able to resist getting involved in the election on his visit here for the Nato summit.But in the end, Trump, largely, kept his views to himself.I understand that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was key in persuading him not to derail Boris Johnson’s election effort.Kushner, who has a leading role at the White House, developed a good relationship with Johnson when the latter was Foreign Secretary and was keen not to have the visit create any distractions.If he doesn’t, we will  have a second referendum where voters will be asked to choose between Remain and Remain-lite. Nigel Farage is badly miscalculating in his refusal to tell voters in Labour Tory marginals to back the Tories.If Labour hold on in seats such as High Peak in Derbys, it will be because of the Brexit Party standing in a seat that it has no chance of winning.One veteran Eurosceptic who has been part of an effort to get the Brexit Party to make clear that voters shouldn’t back it where it has no chance of winning blames Richard Tice, the Brexit Party chair and its candidate in Hartlepool, for blocking any such move.This source tells me Tice is “a nightmare, he is a far bigger problem than Farage”.This election is going to come down to fine margins. The Brexit Party vote could well let Labour hang on in some crucial seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

South Korean jubilation at knocking out the mighty Germans last year.Yet none happened here where the sport began. In fact, not since  — when Bobby Moore held aloft the Jules Rimet trophy — has our great nation hosted the World Cup.It’s time for football to come home. That’s why,elected, I’ll put our Government machine at the heart of a UK and Ireland  World Cup bid.This is about more than staging the tournament. I want it to transform le chances. SoI’m elected next week, I’ll invest £million in order that, within ten years, everyone in England will be, on average, within  minutes of a great local pitch.Above all, I want it to unite us in celebration like the  Olympics did when I was London’s Mayor.I want it to show our national confidence as we get Brexit done: a sign to the world that whilst we are a small country, we’re a great one with a proud history and a strong future.Because, let’s be honest, for the past three and a half years politicians have squabbled over Brexit rather than delivering it — going round in circles rather than focusing on our schools, hospitals and keeping our streets safe.That’s why I had to call the election and why I’m asking Sun readers to visit their local polling station next week.  As you do, cast your mind back five weeks to the endless shouting in parliament. And then imagine five more years of it.In le, as in football, there are moments. Moments when you have to choose. Moments when things come together — or when they fall apart.Moments that define history and set the course of the future.We all remember Gareth Southgate’s heartfelt celebrations last summer and that Eric Dier penalty.We slightly overlook how close the keeper was to saving it. Thankfully he didn’t and we put years of penalty heartbreak behind us.In politics, one of those moments is coming next Thursday.We can either deliver Brexit and move forward with a Conservative majority Government, or we can have more Brexit delay, more arguing in Parliament, and two more referendums in  under Jeremy Corbyn. Next Thursday, I’m asking many dferent people to come on a journey with me. People who always vote Conservative. People who used to but lost faith. People who never have before.All of you who do are putting your trust in me. And I don’t take that lightly at all. Yet I feel so positive about our future as a country outside the EU. There’s so much we can achieve as well as lots we need to improve too.It won’t always be easy. We won’t always agree. But together I really believe we can do it. So come with me on that journey. Let’s unleash our potential. Let’s get Brexit done. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear how preposterous the audience found it.He then claimed, absurdly, that socialism has a better record than capitalism for raising the poor’s living standards.That will be news to Venezuela, which Corbyn once hailed as an ideal ­economic model but which is now a ­living hell of starvation and squalor.Boris was simply more convincing and more statesmanlike. Corbyn, even in a suit, is still the same old backbench crank nursing -year-old grievances.It is incredible anyone would consider putting him in power.THE smearing of Boris as a racist by a Channel  “mistake” is an outrage.We pray it was not deliberate. The channel’s journalists make no secret of their loathing for the Tories.Its news chief branded Boris a liar and presenter Jon Snow likes to chant “f*** the Tories”.Assuming it was a genuine error, what does it say about the culture of a ­supposedly impartial TV network that no one questioned it How did this happen  TV chiefs must come clean.The channel’s apology came too late to stop Corbyn’s Twitter trolls spreading it.Six days from the most crucial election in a letime, it’s a sacking offence.IT is time for the men in white coats to wheel off John Major, Tony Blair and their europhile has-been mates to a safe space where they can gibber together out of harm’s way.Brexit derangement has so utterly confused and consumed them that they are now campaigning against a Tory victory — and thus for the only alternative: a Marxist-run Corbyn coalition.They somehow prefer the immediate economic harm and global shock of that to a stable Tory Government delivering on the majority’s democratic will.These old men simply cannot cope with their defeat three years ago and seek vengeance on those who beat them.They really are that barking. GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn would bankrupt the nation. Corbyn despises this country. Corbyn has spent a career licking the boots of terrorists. Corbyn never met a hate preacher he didn’t like.If Jeremy Corbyn gets elected on Thursday then, in the words of The Carpenters, it will be yesterday once more — and ato the ravages of gormless Socialism, red in tooth and claw, unseen since the Seventies.We have forgotten what mass unemployment is like in this country. We have forgotten what soaring inflation is like. We have forgotten what it is like to endure endless strikes. Corbyn would bring it all back — and worse.For Jeremy Corbyn has no love for this country. He has no affection for our people, our history or our flag.Personally, I couldn’t give a flying figCorbyn watches the Queen’s speech on Christmas Day.But it does bother me that he always takes the side of this country’s enemies.It concerns me that his “friends” include terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA. It disturbs me like hell that Corbyn can even find excuses for Russian thugs conducting their murderous business on British soil.Jeremy Corbyn despises the nation he seeks to lead. And that scares me most of all.Thursday will dawn cold, dark and with the possibility of snow. This close to Christmas, nobody feels like going to a polling booth. But this close to a terrorist-sympathising Marxist moron seizing power, we can’t afford NOT to vote.There are real problems that the incoming government will need to address on day one.Yes, our departure from the European Union is absolutely crucial. But no matter how much we may despise the unelected fat cats in Brussels, the nations of Europe will always be our neighbours and should always be our friends.Leaving the EU while maintaining good trading relations with it is no easy day at the office.And the new PM will have far more than Brexit to deal with. The housing crisis has made owning your own home an impossible dream for the younger generation.The pressures on our schools, roads and NHS are at breaking point. The working man and woman pay too much tax. Serious crime is rising. Climate change is real.All this is waiting in our new Prime Minister’s inbox.Jeremy Corbyn — a stupid, tenth-rate little man with stale, left-wing clichés where his brain should be — is clearly not up to the job.He is an economic cretin who would empty your pockets. He is a spineless hypocrite on Brexit. He has enabled racism to enter the bloodstream of the Labour Party. And he hates the wicked West.“What goes around comes around,” Corbyn sneered when almost , people were murdered on  .Every time there is a terrorist attack, Corbyn finds a way of saying that we had it coming.On Thursday, YOUR vote can keep the worthless old git and his deranged supporters from power.This country deserves better than Jeremy Corbyn.THE Pirelli Calendar was once the byword for lavishly shot sexiness, but it is struggling to find its role in the modern world.Pretentious pictures of Emma Watson as a po-faced nun are probably not the answer to the Italian firm’s dilemma.Next year Pirelli should just print pictures of tyres.It has to be more interesting than this pompous cobblers.HARDCORE James Bond fans have long feared that an increasingly politically correct  was becoming licensed to kill joy.Bond had started coming over all woke. Daniel Craig never needs much encouragement to moan about Bond’s old-fashioned, sexist ways, while sources have claimed that the term “Bond girls” is now banned on  film sets as it is deemed unacceptable in the modern era.All very worthy. And all light years away from the gritty, sexy essence of Ian Fleming’s iconic hero.But the good news is that the trailer for the new Bond movie, No Time To Die, dropped this week and it looks exactly like a  blockbuster should look.Evil villains dreaming of world domination. Fast cars and fast women. Fiendishly clever gadgets. Car chases that would get you nine points on your licence.AndAna de Arma is not the ultimate Bond girl, then my name is Pussy Galore.WHEN I was a child, my family would make a -mile round trip just to gawp at the Christmas wonders of London.The lights of the West End. Santa’s grotto in Selfridges.And the giant Christmas tree given to us every year since  by the nation of Norway, grateful to us for chasing out the Nazis.This year the tree in Trafalgar Square is, frankly, a bit of a disappointment.Did the Norwegians forget to water it That’s not a giant Christmas tree.It’s a big twig.I’m not sure I would go to the end of the garden to see it, let alone drive all the way from Billericay.THE Duchess of Cambridge is such a great ambassador for the Royal Family.In these dficult days, with Prince Andrew all sweaty and Prince Harry all sulky, the glorious Kate never puts a foot wrong.Look at her helping out at a charity for disadvantaged kids on a Christmas tree farm in Great Missenden, Bucks.Sometimes I think that, after the Queen has gone, there is no future for the monarchy in modern Britain.But then I look at Kate – always smiling, always gracious – and I change my mind.WHEN BBC-approved comedian Nish Kumar appeared at The Lord’s Taverners Christmas Lunch he was booed off stage and narrowly dodged a bread roll.Nish made the mistake of trotting out lame anti-Brexit quips that would have had the canned laughter turned up to ten on any BBC  show.This material doesn’t work so well in the real world.The Lord’s Taverners is a cricket charity that supports children living in poverty or with disability. A very good cause.But the audience at their Christmas beano had no appetite for jokes about evil Tories. Although jokes about evil Tories will get your contract renewed at the BBC.Nish, the host of The Mash Report – me neither – told the audience: “I should have known this would happen when I agreed to do a set in front of people who colonised my ancestors.”Desperate stuff, Nish.I very much doubtanyone at that charity lunch colonised anyone’s ancestors.One of these BBC-approved comics should do a stand-up routine on Diane Abbott’s mathematics.Or the Labour Party’s inability to elect a woman leader in  years.This is all worthy of biting satire!But then they would never be asked back on Mock The Week, or The Mash Report nor any of the Beeb’s dreary, joyless, biased crap.Nish Kumar’s humiliation in the real world begs the question: Why should we all pay the BBC £. a year for a licence fee when it only represents the views of some of us Kumar – and all of these BBC-approved comedians – should stay in Broadcasting House.They will be safe there – Nish, Dara O Briain, Sandi Toksvig, Jo Brand and all the rest.They should never go into the real world.Someone might chuck a bread roll at them.PRINCE WILLIAM says he “recycles as much as he can”.Any chance of leaving his beleaguered uncle, the Duke of York, out for the bin men If Andrew is as innocent as he claims in his dealings with child-abusing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, then he should go to the United States and do whatever it takes to clear his name.Until he does so, the former Randy Andy is an embarrassment to his family.And his country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we are also their role models in terms of food choices. If we breakfast on Pringles, pizza and doughnuts then the odds are they will too.By the same token,we start the day with porridge, seeds and fruit, they’ll likely grow up assuming that’s the best way.School is a huge influence, too, and it is great Jamie did succeed. In fact, he started a nationwide trend of schools providing and promoting a healthy diet.But some schools are taking it too far. At one primary I know of, teachers and dinner ladies patrol the lunchtime tables hunting out contraband such as sugary drinks and chocolate, to confiscate it then attempt to shame the parents into submission with letters about their snack misdemeanours.Other schools, it has emerged, are taking it even further than that, with pupils being followed when school has ended.Yes, following them from the school gates to the high street to intervenethey are seen going into a takeaway.Children at Cotham School, in Bristol, have been told they are not allowed to enter at least three convenience stores and a takeaway between .pm and .pm.Not only that, but school staff acting as bouncers have been patrolling the shopping parade and standing in high-vis jackets outside the chippy.The school says it is using powers given by Michael Gove’s  Education Act, which allows it to rule over the conduct of pupils in certain circumstances outside the school gates.The school’s business manager, Allison Crossland, said teachers have the authority over what the pupils do even after the end of the school day.And they are doing so to, “ensure the safety of children on their way home from school”.According to one takeaway owner, teachers went inside and started giving out detentions to children they found in there, although the school denies this.But the takeaway shops on the street say they have seen a drop in business since Cotham School staff started patrolling the streets and, unsurprisingly, they are up in arms as a result.I’m not saying it’s great for kids to snack on high-fat or sugary food when they leave school. Of course it’s not.But is it really the responsibility of their teachers to make sure they don’t  Is it right teachers can rule on what your kids eat when they leave school I don’t think so. AndI was a parent of a child being told what to eat by someone other than me, I’d be furious.I know some people will say this comes down to money, that it’s more expensive to eat healthily.And yes, it is cheaper and easier to snack on sugary foods such as chips and biscuits.Some might say that school dinners are not satisfying enough.Parents need to take it upon themselves to learn about how to cook and eat healthily.You don’t have to spend a fortune to eat well. Look at Jack Monroe, who has written a book on how to cook well with tinned food.There is no doubt something needs to change when it comes to kids and food.The number of obese people in the UK has almost doubled in  years. Rather than paying staff to patrol the chippy, I would vote to bring back domestic science and teach all children how to cook properly from scratch.But as parents, it is our duty, and no one ’s, to look after our children and teach them how to eat well.I KNOW they were doing important work at the Nato summit and all . . . But bloody hell, it was easy for the onlooker to be distracted, wasn’t it, with all the world leaders’ power-mongering going on First of all there were the handshakes. The amount of one-upmanship that can occur in a simple greeting is staggering: Who gets to overpower who by making sure their hand is firmly on top throughout the shake.Who lets go and de-shakes first, and who insists on prolonging the handshake so enthusiastically that it is impossible for the other party to get away until the prolonger is good and ready.Donald Trump famously shakes LONG and HARD. I think it is called the Power Shake and is often employed by people who think the harder they squeeze, the more important and manly they are.They hold on to show they have control over you. But at this summit, Trump possibly met his match with Canada’s Justin Trudeau, who was repeatedly filmed gripping people’s hands so hard that both sets of knuckles were going white.Mind you, that is better than the limp shake. No one likes nor trusts someone with a limp handshake. It’s like shaking hands with a person with no bones.But my least favourite is the sweaty-palm shake.And then there was the footage of Trudeau, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson apparently gossiping about Trump like a bunch of naughty schoolboys.Where’s the leadership qualities in behaving like that It all left me feeling like they need to grow up.And then I saw the photo of our magnicent Queen and all  Nato allies. Guess how many women were in the group  I counted seven, including the Queen. I can’t help but thinkthere were more women involved, less of this childish stuff would go on.But it comes with at least one benefit: An utterly fabulous clothing budget!I have never seen Melania in the same outfit twice .She wore a coat a few months ago which I quite liked the look of, so I thought I might buy it.I looked it up online and it was £,, for something made out of wool. I passed! Mind you, whatever the cost, she looks great and oozes class.I SHUDDERED when I read the story of Jayney Nascimento, , who borrowed £, from her mother for liposuction in the hope of having skinnier legs. But instead of getting the legs of her dreams, she contracted a deadly flesh-eating bug called necrotising fasciitis, which left her fighting for her le and she almost had her legs amputated.Jayney, an administrator from Shropshire, says: “I paid for an expensive cosmetic procedure so I would feel comfortable showing off my legs.“Instead, I nearly lost them and I hate them more now than I did before the operation.”Talk about a sobering reminder that all cosmetic surgery is invasive and has potentially le-threatening side-effects. Is it really worth it I’m guessing this woman would say no.CHRISTIE Brinkley was photographed looking absolutely spectacular at an event in New York. Wearing this black, trenchcoat-style mini- dress, with bedazzling purse and sparkly calf boots she seemed about half her age, which is, incredibly, .If I have half of her joie de vivre and charisma at that age, I will be over the moon.And so should she be.POOR Rhodri Giggs, who told this week about the devastating effect brother Ryan’s affair with his we has had on the family. Quite understandably, he hasn’t spoken to footballer Ryan, , in eight years, since the affair with Rhodri’s we Natasha was revealed.But shockingly, he said his mother Lynne hasn’t spoken to him in the past eight years.Rhodri, , says she has taken Ryan’s side: “Because I haven’t got  medals, I haven’t played for Manchester United for -odd years and own a big house.”Turns out this was a triple betrayal. His we. His brother. His mother. Your entire support network gone overnight. Shame on his motherthat is true.DID anyone  wince over Jeremy Corbyn vowing to confront Donald Trump at this week’s Buckingham Palace reception It was about the sanctity of the NHS, which Trump does not appear to be interested in having anything to do with anyway.In the end, Corbyn didn’t get a chance as he was kept firmly away from the US President, possibly after publicly announcing his intentions.But the US is our main ally and it’s quite shocking that on a visit by the President, the opposition leader has to be kept away from Trump because he can’t be trusted to act with respect.What a calamity it would behe became the leader on December .JUST when I thought my admiration for black cab drivers had reached a peak, I got an invitation to a Christmas lunch organised by the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans.They offered Christmas lunch – turkey and all the trimmings – to  veterans who were taken to the venue by a fleet of black cabs driven by volunteer cabbies.It is so heart-warming that it actually brought a tear to my eye.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But don’t just take our word for it.Today we’ve assembled a  of experts to forensically examine Corbyn’s record. Their verdict is utterly damning.From further Brexit logjams and break-up of the Union, with two new referendums.From soaring taxes and a bust economy to the stain of anti-Semitism and the threat to our national safety.Here are the devastating ­verdicts from six experts . . .THE most straightforward ­consequence of a Jeremy Corbyn ­Government is we’d all be paying more taxes. A lot more.Labour tried to claim that only “the rich” and “the corporations” would pay. But even Corbyn has had to acknowledge that this was a lie.In fact, the sheer scale of Labour’s planned spending and borrowing mean that we’ll all have to dip into our pockets — either immediately or when the borrowing bills come due.The economy is also likely to take a sharp downturn.Corbyn’s plans to tax business and high earners mean many of them will leave the country — indeed, they’ve already got their escape plans ready.Because the Government is so reliant on taxing a few wealthy iniduals, Labour would have to drastically rein in its planned spending, or tax those who do stay even more.With higher taxes — not to mention Labour seizing ten per cent of most big companies, nationalising others and giving the unions far more power — le will get much tougher for businesses. Eventhey don’t up and leave, they’re likely to create far fewer jobs.Labour’s extra spending might compensate for some of this by stimulating the economy in the ­short term.But set against that will be the continued Brexit uncertainty as Corbyn negotiates his own deal and then either does or doesn’t back it in a second referendum.It’s very hard to see who on earth would risk investing in Britain under those circumstances.It would probably be a fairly miserable Christmas, too.Exchange rates would likely fall sharply, making anything from overseas more expensive — andyou wanted to go on holiday you’d definitely need a larger wallet.On top of all this, there’s the lurking threat of a full-on collapse.Either as people with money try to flee the country and Labour tries to stop them — orthe bond markets start refusing to lend John ­McDonnell the hundreds of billions he will need.In short, we might actually end up working a four-day week under Corbyn.But only because there weren’t enough jobs to go round.JEREMY Corbyn is “neutral” on Brexit — the biggest issue the UK has faced in a generation. Yet his deliberately vague policy will leave Britain locked in EU exit paralysis.Millions of voters won’t be neutral about that.Labour claims it will “get Brexit sorted” in six months — negotiating a new deal with Brussels, to be put to another referendum.Trying to have it both ways, Corbyn won’t tell usLabour backs Leave or Remain.Boris Johnson secured an “oven ready” exit deal. Corbyn reckons he can get a “much better” EU deal.Butthe Eurocrats know a new agreement would be followed by a referendum, with an option to Remain, they’d make sure it was utterly terrible for Britain.Then, both Leave and Remain voters would reject it — keeping Britain in and maintaining the annual flow of billions of pounds to Brussels. Brexiteers would then claim with the score at one-all, we need yet another Brexit referendum — the best of three!If Mr Corbyn grabs power after doing a deal with Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon we would face a second referendum anyway — on Scottish independence! It would be chaos.While our economy has held up quite well, the Brexit shenanigans of the past three years are now hitting growth and investment.More months and years in limbo land — over Brexit, and the break-up of the UK itself — would leave Britain deep in the economic doldrums.NEVER in history has a more dangerous man been a contender for leadership of any Western democracy.Corbyn has consistently sided with those that wish us harm. When IRA terrorists bombed the Cabinet at Brighton, his response was to invite two convicted volunteers of the murderous organisation to the House of Commons.And when Russian assassins were sent on a murder mission to Salisbury, Corbyn failed to condemn the Kremlin and called for further proof of state-sponsored involvement.He calls Hamas and Hezbollah his “friends” and appeared to take part in a ceremony honouring a terrorist involved in the Munich Olympics massacre.He said the death of Bin Laden was a tragedy and wanted the leader of IS arrested not killed. The same with British jihadists Mohammed Emwazi and Sally-Anne Jones.His deputies John McDonnell and Diane Abbott demanded the closure of MI, the security agency that protects us from terrorists.With Corbyn as PM how could our allies trust us with their most sensitive secrets The US and Israel, vital sources of le-saving intelligence, have reluctantly drawn up plans to restrict co-operation in the event of a Corbyn premiership.Corbyn has made it clear he would never press the nuclear trigger nor order troops into battle.But credible deterrence is the best way to prevent conflict. Corbyn would subvert our military deterrence and endanger British lives.YOU don’t need a crystal ball to see how a Corbyn government would behave towards Jews.Just look at how it acts in opposition — and know that it will be much, much worse.Last week, a chilling video emerged of Health Secretary Matt Hancock being jeered by Labour supporters at an Election hustings when he mentioned how sickened he was by the party’s refusal to deal with anti-Semitism.The people jeering are the same people who buttress Mr Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour Party.Instead of protecting its Jewish members from Labour racists, the party has refused to act against the racists and driven out many of the most prominent Jews.In Labour now, Jews are hounded and attackedthey refuse to denounce Israel. They are regarded as beyond the pale.In opposition, the Corbynites’ malign influence only extends to the party. In government, it would be felt far beyond. We already know how foreign alliances would be changed.Corbyn has praised as “friends” Hezbollah and Hamas — an organisation committed by charter to the extermination of every Jew on the planet. They will be welcomed as allies — another demonstration of Labour’s contempt for Jews.To cap it all, we have seen in this election the so-called moderates’ embrace of Corbyn as they snf power. Like all extremists, he will be enabled by the spineless, unprincipled careerists.No wonder the vast majority of British Jews fear the prospect of a Corbyn government.GORMLESS Corbyn has said one clear thing during this election campaign. “I ask our media,” the Labour leader declared, “as good journalists, to just report what we say.”Here’s the news, Mr Corbyn: in a free society, it is not the job of good journalists to “just report” what politicians say.It is journalists’ job to question, challenge and even, when required, ridicule what you tell us.Corbyn’s Labour are outraged by the freedom of the Press to ask awkward questions and reveal embarrassing truths.Labour want to drag us through an unnecessary and expensive “Leveson II” inquiry into the media — another show trial in which popular news-papers such as The Sun would be found guilty before the start.Corbyn would also implement Section  of the Crime and Courts Act.This threatens newspapers with the prospect of punitive court fines and costs unless they sign up to the official regulator — Britain’s first state-backed press regulation in  years.He even effectively wants to nationalise the news, with publicly-funded media outlets promoting “public interest” journalism.That’s “public interest” as defined by the authorities, not the public.In short,you want to read Government-approved journalism in a state-sponsored media — vote Labour. No questions asked.A PATHOLOGICALLY anti-motorist political era will be marshalled inCorbyn is elected.Diverting scheduled road improvement funds to railways, for example, will fleece low-income drivers to pick up more of the tab for well-off suburban commuters, while cavernous potholes get even more perilous.Corbyn’s plans to hit drivers with regular increases in fuel duty — amounting to a punitive p per litre hike — will cost White Van Man £, more per year to fill up.The cost of motoring levelled on the world’s highest-taxed drivers will skyrocket to help finance Labour’s trillion-pounds retrograde jamboree. It will restrict freedom of mobility and crash our post-Brexit economy.The cash-hustling band of Left-wing reprobates just don’t get it.The nine-year freeze in duty has never been a cost to the economy.It generates extra tax revenue due to higher consumer spending, reduced distribution costs, more jobs, lower inflation, faster growing GDP and increased company profits.Without that insightful Tory tax policy change to Labour’s  fuel tax myopia, the price of filling up would now be a crippling £. per litre, rising at seven per cent a year.A thriving low-tax economy for everyone, under a Boris Johnson-lead majority administration, is the only solution. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And business, they say, would be left with “just about the most punitive corporate tax system in the world”.Pension funds — huge investors in the utilities up for nationalisation — would be at riskshareholders are not properly compensated.Firms and the rich would flee abroad, taking their taxable billions with them.McDonnell’s plan to seize ten per cent of the shares in every big company would mean more misery. Law firm Clford Chance says “at least £billion of the cost will be borne by pension funds”.Then Corbyn would roll back trade union legislation. Walkouts over ridiculous pay demands and petty grievances would be commonplace. Public sector pay hikes could lead to soaring inflation.“Boomers” will remember the - Winter of Discontent when million days were lost to strikes.In the s tens of thousands quit Britain to escape industrial unrest and high taxes. Expect another brain drain under Corbyn.A major reason why Britain joined the EEC in  was a desperate attempt to improve its uncompetitive productivity.Under PM Corbyn talks to leave the EU would be in the hands of a Brexit neutral. Think about that logically.Corbyn will ask Europe for a deal which he will then not back in a second referendum. So the EU will offer something as close to Remain as they can possibly get. EUref would be a choice between Remain and Remain-in-all-but-name.And Corbyn believes that would placate million Leavers Corbyn needs Lib Dem and SNP help to take No. That’s why he’s been playing footsie with Nicola Sturgeon over a Scottish vote. Britain cannot be governed by continuous referendums. They will only whip up more ision and rancour.Colonel Tim Collins, remembered for his eve-of-battle speech in Iraq in , warns a Corbyn administration would not be trusted to receive vital intelligence from allies.This would have “signicant and far-reaching” consequences for Britain’s security.Nearly half of British Jews would “seriously consider” exiting should Corbyn win.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis warned: “A new poison, sanctioned from the very top, has taken root in the party.”Labour is only the second party — after the far-right BNP — to be investigated by human rights watchdog the Equality and Human Rights Commission.Since the last election around another three million have registered to vote. Over two-thirds are under  — an age group that usually backs Labour and who have no memory of the Winter of Discontent.While opinion polls favour the Conservatives, our destiny will again be decided by tiny swings in key constituencies.So beware Friday the th.

A lot of this can probably be put down to it being  degrees - still quite warm for December, but far from the balmy early evenings of aposs summer campaign.  Still, Jeremy arriving on stage a full  minutes later than advertised tested the crowdaposs patience. One fairweather fan was overheard declaring: Iaposm going to give him five more minutes, then Iaposm going to do a bit of yoga. If he doesnapost have the decency to show up on time, f*** him And long after that guy has given up and namasteaposd away, a plaintive cry of Come on, mate. Weaposre going to the pub rang out from the crowd. Still, Thangham Debbonaire did her best to vamp.  And when Corbyn finally arrived, he was greeted with an enormous cheer, a weary smile on his face and a copy of the Mirror tucked under his arm. More of that later. The speech was the same speech heaposs given on the stump for at least four years. Probably longer. The format is generally a shuffled list of the worthy aims and principles behind his campaign, tied together with the refrain and itaposs also about. Itaposs about the Tories letting a few get sickeningly rich, but doing little to prevent hundreds of thousands getting unspeakably poor. And itaposs also about children waking up on Christmas morning not knowing where theyaposre going to see in the new year. And itaposs also about education. And itaposs also about mental health services - which raised one of the bigger cheers of the afternoon. And in the most recent revision of the Corbyn Creed, itaposs now also about free broadband.  But the big moment came when the Labour Leader raised aloft a copy of todayaposs Daily Mirror - bearing the horric image of a child in Spider-Man pyjamas, huddled for warmth under a coat on the floor of an NHS hospital, a breathing bag hung next to his face. While the worst Jeremy Corbyn had to contend with was a shortage of Glasto magic - far away the wings were falling off Boris Johnsonaposs campaign. Johnson responded to being shown a picture of the aforementioned sick child being let down by his government by snatching a reporteraposs phone and stuffing it in his coat pocket. The Tory leader compounded this terrible, terrible look by apparently deciding to make a  mile journey by private jet rather than car like a normal person. Then he cancelled his third campaign stop in as many days because there might have been some people there who found his oversexed, middle-aged, Dennis-the-Menace-with-the-nuclear-codes schtick neither amusing nor charming. Until today, Tory strategy had been to avoid actually doing or saying anything that could turn into a nothing has changed-scale disaster.

The Shadow Chancellor made the prediction as he unveiled plans for a February budget to end austerity once and for all.Two years ago, Mr McDonnell memorably said he had a scenario plan ready for a run on sterlingLabour took power.But reminded of those comments today, when asked what that plan was, he replied: I said very very clearly there wouldnapost be. Thataposs all the advice weaposve been getting. In fact, my fear is that the pound will start going up because of our investment plans. As Labour activists applauded he added: Weaposll have a large scale investment programme, where yes, private investors as well will be able to get a decent rate ofand will not be ripped off.In addition to that, weaposll bring stability. Weaposll bring stability to decision-making, particularly around Brexit .The markets realise, with regards to Brexit, there is no way the promises Mr Johnson is proffering are in any way truth or implementable.And theyaposre fearful of another round of instability. But above all  theyaposre fearful of dropping off the edge in less than  months into a no deal Brexit .It came as Mr McDonnell unveiled plans to arrange a February  Budget within minutes of taking power to end austerity once and for all.  He said his plan for Labouraposs first  days would save the NHS, give public sector workers a % pay rise, and implement a £ minimum wage for over-s. Mr McDonnell said Labour would begin nationalising water and energy firms within  days, with boards set up to run the utilities. And he vowed to establish a National Transformation Unit before Christmas, based in northern England and tasked with spending £bn in a decade. A full Comprehensive Spending Review would then follow later in  with spending for the full five years. Mr McDonnell was bullish despite a Survation poll widening the Tory lead from  to  points three days before the election.Batting aside questions of whether heaposd step aside or replace Jeremy Corbyn as an interim leader, he said: “It’s not going to happen because we’re going to have a majority Labour government.”  Promising he had “draft plans to hand to the civil servants on Friday”, he said: “We’ve won the argument for our vision of a brighter, fairer and more sustainable future. He added: It starts on Friday morning when Jeremy Corbyn turns up on his bicycle, takes off his bicycle clips, walks up to Downing Street and we go into government.Labouraposs first Budget would fund emergency reforms to Universal Credit while the party designs a new system.It would also kick-start £bn in compensation for aposWaspiapos women denied their pension and bring forward the end of tuition fees. Mr McDonnell admitted some would see the plan as too ambitious but said that was down to “ years of Tory austerity undermining any hope of change”. Pledging to “rebuild from the wreckage” of Tory and Lib Dem rule, he added: We’re setting our sights higher than any opposition party has ever done before. “We’re doing that because we have to. Because the scale of the challenge is greater than ever before.” Saying the UK had “no time to lose” he added: “Any future general election will be too late. We need to start this week.”Mr McDonnell dismissed fears that Labour voters in northern seats will abandon the party - claiming pundits would be shocked. I think it’s going to be won or lost right the way across the country, he said. I think youaposll find there will be some surprising results right the way across the country. He said Labour voters on the doorstep have had enough of austerity. He added: Despite whataposs happening in the opinion polls - although the opinion polls have been consistently trending towards us - I think youaposll see as some of you were shocked in the  election, I think youaposll be even more shocked this time round. But he also appeared to endorse tactical voting, telling ITV News: I will always urge people to vote Labour.But people will make up their own minds about how their vote will have the maximum effect of preventing a Tory government under Boris Johnson ."},{"url":null,"title":"labour accuse tories bare faced","story":"NewsLabour accuse Tories of bare-faced lie that activist punched aide at hospitalThe general election was marred by claims of fake news after both the BBC and ITV political editors apologised for airing claims from \"senior Tories\" about a row outside Leeds General InfirmaryShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video matt-hancock-heckled-outside-leeds-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics labour-accuse-tories-bare-faced-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock was met with angry protesters shouting shame on you! and we do not want you in this country! tonight when he left the hospital following a hastily-arranged visit. Footage from the BBC showed an aide to Mr Hancock walked into a protesteraposs arm - apparently by accident - as the activist, looking the other way, pointed at Mr Hancockaposs car. However, before this footage became available, unconfirmed reports circulated that a Labour activist had punched the aide and even that someone had been arrested. Tonight both ITVaposs and the BBCaposs political editors apologised for incorrect tweets airing the claims, which have since been deleted. I TV Political Editor Robert Peston tweeted: It is completely clear from video footage that Matt Hancockaposs adviser was not whacked by a protestor, as I was told by senior Tories. But that he inadvertently walked into a protestoraposs hand. I apologise for getting this wrong. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg added: Happy to apologise for earlier confusion about the punch that wasn’t a punch outside Leeds General.  sources suggested it had happened but clear from video that was wrong.Thetonight reported that the claims had come in a briefing from Tory aides.Conservative sources claimed on Monday afternoon that the adviser to the health secretary had been hit by a protester, thereported. Aides initially briefed that Hancock’s adviser was apospunched in the faceapos and tried to point the finger at a Labour aposthugapos.  The Mirror understands the incident erupted after the aide in question was unclear at first whether they had been hit deliberately. The protester on a bicycle had been shouting: Ten years of underfunding the system! We do not want you in this city. We do not want you in this country! It is thought the aide contacted bosses to say there had been an incident but took it no further. It is not clearthe miscommunication to journalists after this was deliberate or due to a misunderstanding. A Labour spokeswoman declared: “The Tories are so desperate to distract from a four year old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because of their cuts to our NHS that they have resorted to bare faced lying. “This is a new low and the Conservative Party has serious questions to answer.” A West Yorkshire Police statement said: We are aware of information circulating on social media in relation to an alleged incident involving election campaigners at Leeds General Infirmary this afternoon.

We apologise for what was said and for the offence caused, the Chipping Barnet Conservative Association posted on Facebook. We recognise that those holding office in a political party must take the greatest care to avoid anything which might be viewed as derogatory to any faith or minority community.

Matt Hancock faced furious heckles from a handful of Labour activists as he tried to defuse an explosive row at Leeds General Infirmary. One protester shouted: Ten years of underfunding the system! We do not want you in this city. We do not want you in this country! Initial reports, including by the BBCaposs political editor, suggested one activist punched an aide to Mr Hancock. One claim, not from the BBC, suggested someone had been arrested. Yet the same BBC political editor later produced video footage showing the aide walked into a protesteraposs arm as he pointed in what appeared to be an accident. A West Yorkshire Police statement said: We are aware of information circulating on social media in relation to an alleged incident involving election campaigners at Leeds General Infirmary this afternoon.  We are currently unaware of any reports to West Yorkshire Police of this nature but are seeking to very. Labour tonight blamed the inaccurate reporting on briefings from Tory sources. A Labour spokeswoman declared: “The Tories are so desperate to distract from a four year old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because of their cuts to our NHS that they have resorted to bare faced lying. “This is a new low and the Conservative Party has serious questions to answer.” The hastily-arranged visit came after we revealed Jack Williment-Barr - who had suspected pneumonia - was forced to lie on a pile of coats as he tried to sleep on the floor. The photo prompted outrage with Jeremy Corbyn branding it a disgrace and Mr Hancock admitting: Itaposs not good enough and Iaposve apologised. But Mr Johnson stoked the furore as the took the phone of a journalist trying to show him the photo of little Jack - and put it in his pocket during a live interview. This afternoon Mr Hancock spent an hour in the hospital meeting staff and managers in a visit arranged by his own office. A hospital spokesman said it was to talk about the pressures on childrenaposs AE and also to hear about our plans for expansion of the childrenaposs assessment and treatment unit. Mr Hancock was filmed by one activist leaving the hospital to shouts of shame on you Matt Hancock and on the floor! Sleeping on the floor in a hospital! A video showed him then scurrying into a silver Vauxhall Corsa, appearing to leave one aide behind. What happened next was initially unclear. The BBCaposs Laura Kuenssberg tweeted unconfirmed reports that Labour activists scrambled to go + protest, and it turned nasty when they arrived - one of them punched Hancockaposs adviser. But fellow BBC reporter Nick Eardley, who was at the hospital, said he did not witness any violence and the tweet was later deleted.  And video footage later emerged of the aide walking, apparently by accident, into a protesteraposs arm as he pointed at the retreating car. The BBC also reported Tory sources were suggesting Labour campaigners offered to pay cabs for activists to go and heckle Hancock. But a Labour source dismissed this as untrue. Mr Hancock was due to be briefed on four-year-old Jackaposs case and meet the chief executive during the visit. Asked what he would say to Jackaposs family, Mr Hancock told reporters: Itaposs not good enough and Iaposve apologised. I think the trust have handled it very well. The staff here have been brilliant. Jackaposs family have been at pains to point out that the staff have been absolutely superb.  Asked why he made the visit to the hospital on Monday when it was not on his schedule for the day, Mr Hancock said: Iaposve come because ... I wanted to get reassurance from the trust that theyaposre doing everything they can. Iaposve been very impressed with the response of the trust. The Mirror revealed the four-year-old boyaposs plight today. Sarah Williment covered her son Jack with coats to keep him warm as he waited for a bed at Leeds General Infirmary, where she had taken him on Tuesday fearing he had pneumonia. He was eventually moved to a ward, where he waited for five hours on a trolley before a bed was found at am, Ms Williment told the Mirror.

The depressing figure has been independently fact checked after being widely circulated on social media. There are currently around , McDonaldaposs outlets in the UK. But according to a report in the House of Commons Library there are , foodbanks - and this could be a huge underestimate.Indepedent factchecking charity Full Fact has veried the claim .It says: There are approximately  McDonald’s restaurants in the UK, according to the company.  A recent report by the House Of Commons Library found that there are  at least   food banks in the UK.This figure is an underestimate, as it primarily comes from the Trussell Trust and the Independent Food Aid Network, and does not include every type of food bank, such as food banks operating in schools.Last week Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust - which runs foodbanks across the country - said long waits for Universal Credit payments and the rising cost of living are driving people into poverty.She said: For too many people it’s becoming harder and harder to keep their heads above water – we can’t shy away from the changes that would make the real dference to end the need for food banks. We know issues with the benefits system, like the five week wait for Universal Credit and low payments that aren’t keeping pace with the cost of living, are pushing more people to need food banks than ever before. Of course it’s wrong that anyone needs to use a food bank in the UK. So will all of our party leaders commit to the changes we know need to be made  We need to start putting money back into the pockets of people who most need support, by ending the five week wait for Universal Credit ensuring benefit payments cover the cost of living and investing in local emergency support for people in crisis. Boris Johnson last week addressing the cost of living was his crusade and stated: I applaud everybody who gets involved with running food banks but clearly it is wrong that people should be dependent on them."},{"url":null,"title":"tanya franks dad dementia gets","story":"NewsTanya Franks dad with dementia gets confused between fact and fiction watching her on EastEndersIts the most magical time of year for most of us, but EastEnders star Tanya Franks,  - who plays Rainie Branning - talks candidly about how dementia impacts her family over the festive periodShareCommentsByLara Kilner:,  DEC News\"Get the biggest soaps stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

At first, weaposd think, ‘Well, he’s getting older and more forgetful,’ but it became more obvious that something wasn’t right.When the doctors told us he had dementia, Derek, who is a very practical person and doesn’t easily show emotion, became accepting of it pretty quickly.My mum was more upset – to think of seeing someone you love possibly slip away, knowing what he might go through. We got in touch with the Alzheimer’s Society and learnt more about the condition, and we sat and talked about it a lot as a family. We made a decision to take each day as it comes, that there was no point living unhappily, worrying what the future was going to hold – let’s live in the now, the today. And that has served us really well. We speak openly and practically and philosophically about it, and we face it head-on.Everyone’s experience is dferent, and dementia can develop quickly – with Derek it’s been pretty gradual over the six years.  The most dficult part for him is having to slow down and recognise that he can’t do the same things he used to. He gave up driving because odd things began to happen, like he once swerved to avoid something in the road that wasn’t there, so that loss of independence is tough.And he’s always been very much a do-er, he can’t sit still for very long unless he’s watching sport on the telly. He loves gardening and he’s still pottering around the garden, but when he bought some new plants recently that needed to be potted, he just couldn’t remember how to do it. Sometimes he can’t rememberhe’s brushed his teeth, so he’ll do them twice, and he won’t remember that he’s got to go up the stairs to get to the bathroom. He loves playing the piano, but now he can’t remember that he’s just played something, so he’ll play the same song half a dozen times. One time, he couldn’t even find the piano, and was looking for it on the shelf under the kettle in the kitchen. And of course the piano isn’t even in the kitchen. With the TV remote control, he’ll sometimes look at it and not know how to use it – he’ll start pointing it at the cupboard.We do laugh, because you have to find the funny side – there is humour in le, even in tough times. One night he was going upstairs and I said, ‘Sleep well, Derek,’ and he replied, ‘Well, I will doI can remember where the bed is…’ He does understand the situation, and the raw reality. Another dficult thing is the physical danger. His brain seems to stop tellinghis body to feel pain, so he could have a deep cut and he won’t know he’s bleeding because he doesn’t always feel it.  He sometimes has problems seeing things below knee height, so he’ll fall over coffee tables, or any kind of obstacle – it can be a person sitting on the ground and he just won’t see them.We’ve had to move flower pots or he’ll just wade through them. And in the garden, we have put thick white tape on the steps, so he can see them – his brain can make natural colours, like grey, blend into each other.The edges of plates can be dficult to see for Alzheimer’s sufferers too, and the food will fall off, so we try to use vivid colours to help him out. Luckily, he’s still good at looking after his personal hygiene – so long as he can find the toilet! Recently, in the middle of the night he got up and sat on the bedroom chair thinking it was the loo.My mum was like, ‘No, Derek, quick!’ She’s always sleeping with one eye open, looking out for him all the time. He can’t be left alone.He couldn’t be responsible for doing anything, like cooking, that could cause him harm.Mum is really good at being diplomatic, but she has to stop him hurting himself. It can sound like she’s telling him off, which frustrates him, and it’s dficult because his brain isn’t always working logically now.To give mum some time to herself – the first in six years – he’s started going to a local day care centre. I don’t live close by and my EastEnders filming schedule is erratic, but I try to get there when I can, and she has neighbours who help out too. Dementia can be a very lonely illness for the people living with it and their carers, especially at Christmas, and it’s easy to think you’re the only person who feels like this.But it’s not something to hide away. The more we speak about it, the more people understand and will rally round.We haven’t always spent Christmas together as a family – Mum has always been happy for me to go awayI’ve wanted to – but Derek’s illness has made me want us all to be together for special occasions. Because change is happening, and I want to spend the time with Derek as much as I hope he wants to spend the time with us. While we can still enjoy celebrations together, let’s do it, I want to keep hold of these moments.

A pre-inquest review hearing today heard claims Shukri, who couldnapost swim, was being bullied by other girls when it happened. Senior coroner Joanne Kearsley said there was a aposquestion as to whether alleged bullying was relevant to the inquestapos, the Manchester Evening News reports. In response, Ashley Underwood QC, representing Shukriaposs family, replied aposconsiderablyapos. He added: The other component is the degree to which there was a relationship of violence between the girls and the degree to which we should be permitted to ask the children about the background to the day. When Ms Kearsley asked what violence had taken place, she was told there had been an incident of apospushingapos about six months before Shukriaposs death. Mr Underwood said there was also aposa question of whether, on the day, there was coercionapos, with Shukri being persuaded against her will to go to the river. Mr Kearsley said she would consider the scope of the inquest and report back to all interested parties within seven days. Reporting restrictions have been put in place preventing the identication of four children Shukri had contact with after leaving school the day she died. The children were referred to as child one, two, three and four. The coroner also said she had aposreal concernsapos whether the children are aposfit enough to give evidenceapos. She added: I think concerns have been raised by other agencies working with the children. I am going to make some enquiries as to whether the children are able to give evidence from a health perspective. Ms Kearsley said thatany of the children are to appear before the inquest it will be done via video link.

The Essex Police Community Team came along and we had to close the road because of the number of people. I rang the the council to seewe could close the road and they did.  There was no official switch-on last year but there were around  people the year before that. It took four evenings to prepare the projector and the mapping this year, so around  hours.The switch-on event had mascots and even Santa made an appearance.

The show begins at .pm everyday and runs until .pm from Sunday to Thursday and until .pm on Fridays and Saturdays.

But the squirming Prime Minister refused to even look at the photo when confronted by a TV reporter.Confronted by a TV reporter with the image of poorly Jack from Friday’s Mirror front page, the Prime Minister repeatedly dodged it. At one point the mumbling PM even pocketed the reporter’s mobile to avoid doing so.  And in a desperate bid to limit the damage, the shame-faced PM sent Health Secretary Matt Hancock to Leeds General Infirmary where Jack was treated. But by then the story had crossed the Atlantic with CNN and the Washington Post reporting it.Jack’s plight also made headline news on the BBC, ITV and Sky. Four-year-old Jack had been rushed to Leeds General as his GP suspected he had pneumonia. It wasn’t the first time the Tory leader was confronted our story on the scandal on the worst day of his election campaign so far.And former Mirror editor Piers Morgan shared it with his .million Twitter follower saying “The, harrowing Mirror front page that Boris Johnson couldn’t bear to look at. Will it derail his election campaign ”.The shocking tale prompted Louise Webb, , to contact the mirror after her nine-month old baby, Lily, was forced to wait six hours for a bed. Louise had taken Lily to the Countess of Chester Hospital near their Ellesmere Port home, after she deteriorated following weeks of illness.  Suffering from an ear infection, vomiting and diarrhoea, the baby was badly dehydrated. Louise, Lily’s and her dad, Thomas Noden, , were signed in to AE hospital at .am last Wednesday. Yet they had to wait until am before she was seen by a doctor. It was a further hour before Lily was seen by a children’s specialist who Louise said told them: “We have not got enough beds.” Louise added: “She said, ‘You can sit in the waiting room where to wait for a bed, but that could be hours’.”  Louise and Thomas stayed up all night, with their sick baby on a chair. They took their photo at am. Louise said the overstretched medics did their best and blamed austerity for the chaos. “They have not got enough funding, they have not got enough nurses,” she said. Thankfully over the next  hours, Lily began to improve. But the experience left Louise feeling “something needs to change.” She said: “To sit in a hospital and see at first hand the situation, it really opens your eyes.” Dr Susan Gilby, chief executive at the hospital, said: “We apologise to anyone who has to wait longer than four hours. We would be very grateful to receive their feedback.” As the fall out from our story on little Jack continued Mr Johnson was met with a storm of criticism across the media and from outraged members of the public.  First he was confronted on LBC radio, then at an event at a factory on Tyneside and in the ITV interview with reporter Joe Pike. The journalist had to point out on air the PM had snatched his phone. Mr Johnson finally looked at the image which he described as a “terrible, terrible photo”. He added: “Obviously we have every possible sympathy for everybody who has a bad experience of the NHS, that’s why we’re putting a record investment into the NHS.”  But his spending claims were challenged at the factory by mum Page Hood, who said her son endured two y waits in AE in a week. She said: “No one should believe that – they’ve been in power for nine years.“I don’t understand how anyone is going to trust the Conservatives”. At a rally in Bristol Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn held aloft a copy of the Mirror, branding the image a “disgrace”.As supporters shouted “Shame on you Boris” he urged people to vote Labour to save the health service. He said: “The Tories have had nine years to fund our NHS. It’s time to bring their regime to an end.”  Mr Hancock, who had earlier called Jack’s mum to apologise, was shown our story during his visit to Leeds. “It’s not good enough and I’ve apologised,” he said. But Mr Johnson’s bad day got worse when Conservative aides invented a story that one of Mr Hancock’s team was punched by a Labour activist.

Simon Flint, , admitted possessing prohibited weapons, gunpowder and an array of components for making improvised explosive devices. A court heard he was arrested on June  after threatening a group of teenagers and a passerby with a crossbow. It prompted a police search which found the deadly arsenal in a camper van he lived in and a lock-up he used, near to Middlesbrough’s Riverside football stadium. As well as explosives - which had to be blown up by the Bomb Squad - officers found crossbow bolts which had been fitted with razor blades at the end and adapted to explode on impact. His defence at an earlier hearing claimed he “maybe slightly eccentric” but that he was a “hobbyist, not a terrorist”, which was accepted by prosecutor Jolyon Perks.  He told the court the precision machinest had a “skewed sense that he needed to defend himself.” He added: “The devices were demonstrated in videos where he destroys fruit and a laptop computer with the use of improvised explosive devices.” But after the case, it emerged that Flint, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, had tried to recruit members to carry out “operations” for a right-wing vigilante group he had set up.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhile cooking the Christmas dinner can be one of the most stressful parts of the festive season, stocking your cupboards and fridge right could actually help boost your mood and energy levels.Dietitian Juliette Kellow reveals the foods that will help you dial down the tension, promote calm and boost feel-good hormones this festive season.How to fight festive strain ■ Eat regularly Your to-do list may mean meals get low priority but skipping them will make your blood sugar levels crash, leaving you tired, hungry, irritable and stressed out. ■ Don’t rely on caffeine When you’re busy, downing mug after mug of strong coffee to keep you going can put you even more on edge. Caffeine is a stimulant and in large amounts it creates a stress reaction in the body. ■ Limit the booze Alcohol is dehydrating. Symptoms include irritability, tiredness and poor concentration – the perfect ingredients for making us stressed! And a hangover can make any situation seem more dficult. ■ Skip the sugar Super-sugary snacks, such as sweets, mince pies or a frosting-laden yule log, will send blood sugar levels on a rollercoaster ride. You may feel a massive high initially, but this is quickly followed by a rebound, stress-inducing dip. ■ Don’t cut the carbs These trigger the release of insulin, which helps the amino acid tryptophan enter the brain, where it’s used to make the feel-good chemical serotonin. Choose carefully though – swap white, processed carbs such as bagels, pasta, cornflakes and white rice for brown, higher-fibre, unprocessed versions including wholemeal bread, wholewheat pasta, oats and brown rice. These will keep you fuller for longer and even out blood sugar levels, preventing drops that leave you stressed. Turkey As it’s packed with protein, which makes us feel fuller for longer, turkey will prevent ‘hanger’ . But that’s not the only way turkey works its calming magic. It’s rich in the amino acid tryptophan, which makes serotonin, a feel-good chemical in the brain. This acts as nature’s own tranquilliser, making us happier and calmer. Studies also suggest tryptophan may make us less argumentative and more agreeable – a definite plus for preventing festive family fallouts. Turkey is rich in vitamins B and B too, which are vital for mental wellbeing, and studies show a link between low levels of these nutrients and depression. A large portion of roast turkeyprovides % of our daily protein needs and around half our recommended B and B. Top tip Enjoy both the light and dark meat to maximise your nutrient intake – dark meat contains around double the iron, copper and zinc of the breast, while the light meat is richer in potassium and vitamin B.  Oranges  satsumas Oranges and small citrus fruits, such as satsumas and clementines, are essential for strong immunity. Stress zaps the body of vitamin C, which can weaken the immune system, making us more vulnerable to infections around Christmas.Vitamin C also helps to combat fatigue  and boosts the absorption of iron from plant foods.Meanwhile, a lack of iron can leave us weak, exhausted and unable to concentrate, evenwe’re getting plenty of sleep, making us even less able to cope with underlying stress. Two medium satsumas provide % of our daily vitamin C requirement and count as one of your -a-day. Top tip For the best iron-boosting effects, eat iron and vitamin C-rich plant foods together – for example, a satsuma with a handful of nuts.  Brussels sprouts Don’t leave these little gems on the side of the plate. Sprouts are full of folate, a B vitamin important for mental wellbeing. It’s indirectly needed to make mood-boosting neurotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline.Unsurprisingly, numerous studies show folate levels are often low in people who suffer with depression. A serving of eight spoutsprovides % of our daily need for folate, soenjoy them over Christmas while they’re at their seasonal best.Top tip Steam rather than boil sprouts to retain their taste, texture and vitamins. NutsAll nuts contain protein and fibre, as well as stress-busting nutrients such as iron and some B vitamins. They also contribute magnesium, which relaxes muscles and prevents an irregular heartbeat. Magnesium deficiency has been linked with sleep problems too, with studies showing that supplements may improve insomnia, especially in the elderly. A g serving of Brazils provides a third of our daily magnesium needs. Nuts are also beneficial for our digestive system, which often responds negatively to stress. As well as containing fibre, nuts are prebiotics, so they feed the good bacteria in our gut. One study found eating two handfulsof almonds a day for six weeks improved the growth of beneficial strains of gut bacteria. Another study showed similar results for pistachios. Top tip Nuts are high in calories, so stick to a handful. Shells act as a useful reminder of the amount eaten – one study found keeping pistachio shells meant adults consumed fewer, saving them kcal.  Figs When festive stress reaches its peak , the traditional figgy pudding may come into its own: figs offer a number of calming nutrients. Dried figs are packed with fibre to help keep us feeling full and they’re rich in potassium, which is important for controlling blood pressure. Figs also provide sleep-inducing magnesium, fatigue-busting iron and vitamin B. Top tip Two figs count as one of your -a-day whether they are fresh or dried. Game Christmas means we’re more likely to see roasts such as goose, duck and venison on the menu. Like most meats, game is packed with hunger-busting protein, it’s rich in mood-boosting tryptophan and usually contains plenty of B and B.But, unlike turkey, most game is also a fantastic source of iron. This is essential for healthy blood and preventing anaemia, which can leave us feeling tired and worn out – not great at an already exhausting time ofyear. In fact, many of the symptoms of anaemia are similar to those of stress: extreme fatigue, poor memory and concentration, low energy levels, palpitations and disturbed sleep. Lab studies also show stress itself can deplete blood iron levels.Top tipGoose and duck are fattymeats, but much of the fat is contained in the skin and the layer beneath it, so removing the skin will help to reduce calories and fat."},{"url":null,"title":"how dry pet food made","story":"AdvertorialOwn a cat or dog  This is how dry pet food is madePurina pet food production specialist explains the fascinating seven step processShareByDave Masters:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC AdvertorialA delicate mix of high quality ingredients ensure your pet gets a balanced diet\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Just days after the snap was taken, a warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor. The case ultimately resulted in Epstien being convicted and jailed for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. A source told The Sun on Sunday, which has published the Epstein image: “This photograph sums up just why the Epstein affair has been so disastrous for Andrew. He brought these people into the royal fold, to Windsor Castle no less, where they could rub shoulders with the great and good. This picture will raise further questions about Andrewaposs interaction with these iniduals. Around  guests turned up to the event which asked attendees to wear fancy dress from , a century before the birth of Beatrice. Royals at the bash included Peter and Zara Phillips and Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex.  A-list Hollywood guests at the party included Demi Moore and then-husband Ashton Kutcher, Pixie Geldof, Kelly Osbourne and Sir David Frost. Weinstein, , has pleaded not guilty to charges that he sexually assaulted two women, one in  and another in .  His trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. , . The former film mogul has been accused of sexual misconduct dating back decades by more than  women. He has denied the allegations, saying any sexual encounters were consensual. Maxwell, wearing a gold mask in the image, is being investigated by the FBI on suspicion of procuring girls for Epstein. On Sunday it was reported that she was in talks with US TV networks about an interview in which she will speak in favour of the Duke of York. The -year-old, who is the daughter of disgraced billionaire Robert Maxwell, will say that Virginia Gufre, formerly Roberts,  is lying when she claims Prince Andrew slept with her when she was . A source told The Sun: “Ghislaine is in hiding and knows the only way to stop being hunted is to speak on her own terms.  “She will do a sit-down interview with a big US network and defend the duke. Apparently, she’ll say Virginia Giuffre is lying and Andrew never had sex with her.” In the recent car-crash BBC Newsnight interview, host Emily Maitlis asked the Duke of York: In July he was invited to Windsor Castle to your daughter, Princess Beatriceaposs th birthday, why would you do that  He answered he was actually asking Epsteinaposs girlfriend Maxwell to the party. Prince Andrew said: Because I was asking Ghislaine. But even so, at the time I donapost think I ... certainly I wasnapost aware when the invitation was issued what was going on in the United States and I wasnapost aware until the media picked up on it because he never said anything about it. Ms Maitlis carried on and asked: So he came to that party knowing police were investigating him. The Duke replied: Well Iaposm not quite sure, was it police  I donapost know, you see, this is the problem, I really donapost know.

McCann, , will serve a minimum term of  years before he is even considered for release following his depraved sex attacks on  women and children. The convicted burglar had been freed after a probation service error, two months before he embarked on a cocaine and vodka-fuelled rampage. Over  days, he abducted, raped and assaulted victims aged between  and  in Watford, London and the North West. Today at the Old Bailey in London, Mr Justice Edis described McCann a classic psychopath. He said: This was a campaign of rape, violence and abduction of a kind which I have never seen or heard of before. He said there should be an independent investigation into how the system failed to protect McCannaposs victims from him. Mr Justice Edis continued: Joseph McCann you are very dangerous indeed to people who are weaker then you are. Among other things you are a coward and violent bully and a paedophile. Your grip on reality is quite tenuous, your instructions to lawyers were utterly ridiculous. You are entirely obsessed with yourself. In your world other people exist only for your pleasure and you have no ability to see the world in anybodyaposs eyes other than your own.  You are a classic psychopath. Paying tribute to his victims, the judge said: Each of these stories is tragic. I hope each will find a way to live through their ordeal and future happiness. McCann, who had addresses in Aylesbury and Harrow, refused to attend his Old Bailey trial and hid under a prison blanket rather than give evidence. It was claimed on his behalf that the women he was accused of molesting had consensual sex, but that was dismissed as ludicrous by victims. On Friday, the jury deliberated for five hours to find him guilty of  charges relating to  victims, including eight rapes,  imprisonment and kidnap. The court heard he had a string of convictions in the North West and South East of England, having received his first term behind bars at the age of .  While he had no convictions for sexual offences he did have a history of violence and threats towards partners of his, prosecutor John Price QC said. Crimes included escaping custody by grabbing and threatening a female Group  security guard with a plastic kne, possessing a blade, robbery and two burglaries. Since his release in February, McCann was seen by probation officers  times. The last occasion was on April , three days before McCann committed his first rape. A probation officer said McCann had attended the Watford probation office where he was served with a warning for failing to disclose a new relationship, under the terms of his licence because of his history of domestic violence. McCann was not happy about it and when his new fianceeaposs parents found out about the condition they broke off the relationship because they thought he was a sex offender.  In a victim impact statement, one of McCannaposs victims told how her le had changed from being thriving to surviving. The court heard how McCann snatched his first victim from the street in Watford and raped her in her own bed in the early hours of April . The woman named her attacker to police, and McCannaposs details were put on the Police National Computer and a prison recall was issued. But McCann remained at large and on April  he abducted a -year-woman in Walthamstow, and subjected her to a -hour rape ordeal. Hours later, he was caught on CCTV bundling another young woman into his car in north London, as her sister ran off screaming. They escaped in Watford, after the -year-old hit McCann over the head with a vodka bottle.  The politan Police circulated a CCTV image of McCann in Watford and received a tip-off with his name following a public appeal. On May , McCann tricked his way into the home of a woman he met in a bar in Greater Manchester, tied her up and molested her children, aged  and . The teenage girl, who described McCann as evil, jumped out of a first-floor window to alert police. Later that day, McCann pounced on a -year-old woman. He raped her, and abducted and assaulted a -year-old girl in her car, before they got away. As police closed in, McCann forced two -year-old girls into the car by threatening to chop them up with a machete. He was captured on CCTV buying condoms at a service station before he was spotted by a patrol car, which gave chase. McCann drove the wrong way on a roundabout and crashed into a Mercedes before making off on foot, leaving the terried girls behind.  A police helicopter finally located him up a tree, he was coaxed down and arrested early on May . The violent offender later told police: If you had caught me for the first two, the rest of this wouldnapost have happened. Following the verdicts, the Probation Service issued an unreserved apology for a blunder which led to McCannaposs release in February, halfway through a three-year sentence for burglary. Detective Chief Inspector Katherine Goodwin, who led the investigation, said: “McCann is one of the most dangerous offenders this country has ever seen and the sentence handed down today is a reflection of his heinous crimes. “Although the criminal proceedings are over, we should never forget that the  iniduals who were subjected to McCann’s completely evil actions will have to live with those memories for the rest of their lives. “Their unwavering support for the police investigation and the evidence they gave in court meant the jury had no choice but to see McCann for the depraved inidual he really was. “I must also thank all of the officers involved in this long and complex case, from those who first responded and provided immediate support to the victims, through to the investigation team who have dedicated the last few months preparing for this trial. “We all had one ultimate aim – to bring McCann to justice and make sure no-one  will ever have to suffer at his hands.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles pal told take","story":"NewsMeghan Markles pal told take down damaging photos of Duchess in her jewelleryEXCLUSIVE: Jenner Myer has been ordered to take down the pictures of the Duchess of Sussex and has been told how damaging this could be for Meghan and the Royal FamilyShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghan-talks-motherhood-ahead-airing-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markles-pal-told-take-\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

As Birmingham Live reports, Ryan has a drink in the footage and settles down on the bench by the wall.

Martin Clarke, a jeweller at nearby Vault , said: I saw a small tent with a couple lads in high-vis vests early in the morning on Friday. I thought they were from the council and were just doing a bit of upkeep. About half six I looked out the window and the tent had gone as had the lads. Then I saw it. I thought it was great. We werenapost sure what it was at first or who did it but we had a good idea. And a message on the fabled artist’s instagram said: God bless Birmingham.

Parts of Scotland will be battered by mph winds and up to mm of rain will fall in this area.Tuesday is going to be wet and windy for large swathes of the country. We have got a couple of weather warnings in place, for rain and wind.

Theyaposll be gusts of -mph inland and mph at the coast. It is going to be especially strong at the coast through the Irish Sea. While temperatures will hit C in Manchester and Edinburgh, itaposll feel considerably colder due to the monster gales. These may also cause delays for vehicles on exposed routes and bridges and a short-term loss of power and other services. The weather warning has been issued for most of north Wales and as far south as Staffordshire and Shropshire in England. Mr Miall added: Theyaposll be heavy rain in the same areas. Scotland will see the heaviest rainfall, up to mm in the mountains.  The average rainfall for December in western Scotland is around mm so it will be very wet on Tuesday, but typically Scotland is wet in December. On Wednesday, itaposll still be windy but theyaposll be more sunshine in some parts. Heavy showers on Wednesday will fall as hail and be thundery at times.

White Island Tours released a statement saying the company was deeply saddened following the signicant eruption.  Paul Quinn, Chairman for White Island Tours, said: “Devastation is an understatement. This is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been impacted.” There are fears for the lives of  other people including four Brits after the volcano erupted as tourists walked around the site in Bay of Plenty today. The missing people were said to be mainly foreign tourists with many from a visiting cruise ship, the Ovation of the Seas. Horrying webcam images showed holidaymakers and guides standing in the crater moments before the eruption hit White Island.  Four Britons are listed as missing on a Red Cross list, which allows family and friends concerned about loved ones to register an inquiry. Authorities have there is no sign of le on the island, also known as Whakaari, following flyovers late on Monday local time. Anyone who could have been could have taken alive from the island would have been rescued already, they believe. Police said in a statement: The Police Eagle helicopter, rescue helicopter, and NZDF aircraft have undertaken a number of aerial reconnaissance flights over the island since the eruption.  No signs of le have been seen at any point. Police believe that anyone who could have been taken from the island alive was rescued at the time of the evacuation. Based on the information we have, we do not believe there are any survivors on the island.  Victims suffering from severe burns were ferried to New Zealand’s North Island,  miles away, on tourist boats. At least seven of the injured remain in a critical condition today in hospitals in Tauranga and Auckland.

While pregnant, Huyen was forced into a Melbourne detention centre where she gave birth to her daughter Isabella in March . The baby and her mother have been in detention ever since. Isabella, who has never left the facility, is only able to see her father for a short time each day when he visits her and her mum after work.

A psychologist has diagnosed Huyen with depression and Isabella with anxiety.

Mr Finlay and his we then made their way to the Italian Grill where Mr Finlay was refused service in his intoxicated state. He was abrasive and belligerent with officers.#Given the circumstances the chief constable considers that the applicationbe refused.#Finlay had a not guilty plea to indecent exposure accepted in court, but he pleaded guilty to an amended charge of threatening and abusive behaviour.His solicitor, Kris Gilmartin, said the exposure of his buttocks had not been malicious.Mr Gilmartin said: #His behaviour at the Italian Grill was entirely regrettable and is something he regrets.#He was with his we and both had consumed probably too much alcohol. He has paid compensation to the people involved and apologised to them and the matter, as I understand it from their point of view, is closed.#There were other allegations made by Police Scotland and they were found to be wanting in court when properly addressed.#The CCTV had shown that Mr Finlay#s buttocks are exposed, but it is apparent that has really been an unfortunate situation when he has been walking across the road # his buttocks have been exposed for a very short period of time.#It#s dficult for me to comprehend why it would be necessary to refuse such a licence.#Mr Finlay has been a licence holder for some ten years and has never been before the committee before. He stands here with one blot on his character.#The shame-faced bar manager told the licensing board: #This was out of character and I#m sitting here embarrassed and red-faced.

She spent most of her time alone in her bedroom.One day she randomly bought an embroidery kit online and became hooked on having a task and “creating something beautul”, improving her feeling of self-worth in the process.Inspired, she was suddenly eager to take part in crafting sessions to learn more but could only manage a few steps outside the door.Nicola said: “Everyone was out living their lives and to me an achievement would be only napping once a day, instead of three times.“When I first started going out again it was terrying. I felt so shaky and unsure of everything.“I’d been in the house so long that one of our downstairs neighbours who moved in four years earlier didn’t even know I lived there.“I knew from research it was important not to push myself into things too fast, so I stopped at the end of the path.“Turning around to go back inside was a huge relief and getting back into our flat was like being wrapped in a big safety blanket but I soon became aware of how confined I was inside.” vw, px\"  Nicola slowly began to attend crafting workshops with her parents also in attendance, the first of which was a puppet making class ran by How It Felt.The social enterprise uses puppet-making and drama sessions to encourage people to talk about mental health issues, which Nicola says played a huge part in her recovery journey.From there she got the confidence to join other crafting groups and started an online distance learning course with the Embroiderer’s Guild to ease back into studying.Nicola says she still often feels unwell but the intensity has reduced to such an extent that she hopes to one day study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd.

Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line.

No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually. There is a lot of work going on, but I think we can do more.The next general elections hustings are set to take place on Monday.At .am, BBC Scotland will host a hustings at Heart of Hawick, while in the evening a second hustings, organised by Selkirk Community Council, will take place at Victoria Halls, Selkirk, at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"musical-instruments-ready-collect-peebles-high","story":"MUSICAL instruments left behind after last weeks fire are now ready to collect.All instruments have been collected from Peebles High School after the fire which has forced the High School to close until after Christmas.The instruments have been transported to Priorsford Primary School and will be available until pm today .Scottish Borders Council are making arrangements for further opportunities to collect belongings and instruments tomorrow , details of which will be released in due course.For all updates on the fire, visithttps:www.scotborders.gov.uk PHSfireHave you been impacted by the fire  Get in touch.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent. The food van arrived and he packed the chocolate under his jacket. It was more than chocolate.Now he had to get through the freezing night.Tomorrow, hersquod be loved again."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrating-pls-home-50-years","story":"The building was opened on November , , by John P Mackintosh MP after the old one burned down in .Former and present staff, pupils and friends came together to celebrate the anniversary of the building with a coffee morning and a chance to tour the school.Headteacher Gavin Clark said: ldquoOur th anniversary celebration was a great opportunity for past and present pupils, staff and friends of Preston Lodge to come together and reflect on our schoolrsquos place in the community.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve.

American Express Shop Small found that % of Scots said they would be more environmentally-friendly this Christmas.Presents wrapped in newspaper, energy-saving fairy lights and living trees. This yearrsquos Christmas has become, for many, about sustainability. And thatrsquos hardly surprising. Although it is a festival of consumerism, Christmas has also always been a time of reflection on what we can do to make the world a better place.Some of our great traditions are having to be rethought in this time of climate emergency and plastic pollution, and Christmas is one of them. But what we learn will reach far beyond the big day. What Christmas offers us is a moment to look at how we might find pleasure in a zero-emissions world.In the book There Is No Planet B, Mike Berners-Lee remarks that what we need to do is ldquoget better at enjoying things that donrsquot require much energy. Examples include walks, books, most types of party, most forms of socialising, local holidays and any hobby that doesnrsquot rely on fossil fuel.Sounds like a recipe for a merry eco ChristmasItrsquos beginning to look a lot like nut roastTofu on every table ... or is it  Letrsquos face it, Christmas is a feast day. Itrsquos all about the food, about getting your loved ones round the table and eating more than you normally do. Food is an emotional thing and for many a roast bird resonates festive feeling. If Christmas is anything like last year,we in the UK will consume around  million turkeys.So, do we have to, in the interests of the planet, go cold turkey and ditch the festive favourite  Perhaps not, though it would go some way towards helping cut your emissions for the day. One study, carried out by the University of Manchester, found that a UK Christmas dinner for six produces the equivalent of kg of carbon dioxide emissions, and that % of these are related to the le cycle of the turkey. By contrast, a vegan nut roast plus roast potatoes cooked in vegetable oil, vegan pigs in blankets, sage and onion stuffing, and vegetable gravy to feed six emits only .kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.But, at the same time, there are many good things about a traditional Christmas dinner. The vegetables are usually seasonal, of the sort that can be grown locally. A roast turkey is also not nearly as bad as a regular Sunday roast of beef. As Mike Berners-Lee has put it: ldquoChickens and turkeys are very much at the efficient end of the meat spectrum. Red meats are a quite a lot less efficient. The carbon footprint of beef would be about  kilos of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilo of beef, whereas for turkey, it would be nearer three.In fact, you might want to be more wary about the sustainability of the party bites and the fancy starters than the turkey dinner. Have the scallops come from a seabed damaged by dredging  Is the smoked salmon from a farm plagued with parasitic sea lice, or that pollutes the sea  Has the farming of those giant tiger prawns resulted in the chopping down of a mangrove forest, a vital carbon sink  Have your avocados resulted in a drought in another part of the world Buying local and keeping the transport emissions as low as possible is another way of whittling away at your feasting footprint. Also, remember itrsquos okay to have a feast, or a moment of indulgenceit is, as tradition dictates, the big blow-out before a winter of scarcity. If yoursquore just about to embark on Veganuary and you love nothing more than a Christmas turkey ndash have it. Itrsquos not what you eat on one day that matters. Itrsquos what you eat every day.Flying home for Christmas One of the problems with Christmas is that so much of it is about the love miles. A study into ldquoThe Carbon Cost of Christmas found that the average UK resident will travel around  miles to visit family and friends at Christmas. How they do that will have a big impact on their emissions.Last year, when the Energy Saving Trust looked into the travel emissions impact of Christmas, it took a round trip from London to Edinburgh as an example.By plane the journey resulted in emissions of kg, by train kg and by petrol car kg . To put this Christmas carbon footprint in perspective, for the emissions tag of that London-to-Edinburgh trip you could sit down to a slap-up meal of nine-and-a-half turkeys all to yourself.But love miles, and associated love emissions, are the hardest thing to talk about around Christmas. After all, gathering together is what, for many of us, it is all about ndash and we now live in a world where relationships are stretched sometimes between continents. For many of us, though, there are ways of cutting down the emissions. Taking the train, not plane, for instance, is one. Sharing a car journey with others is another.On the first day of leftovers, my true love made for me hellipA spiced turkey naan and a nut roast falafel wrap. Or one of the other wonderful recipes that can make Christmas leftovers such a treat. According to Zero Waste Scotland, ldquo, tonnes of food and drink is thrown away from Scottish homes in December alone. Avoiding just % of that waste would save nearly , tonnes of carbon ndash the equivalent of taking , cars off the road in the UK for a year.There are, of course, several other ways of reducing waste. Cooking only what you need, paying attention to portion size, and not getting sucked in by a particularly attractive BOGOF are part of the formula ndash as well as picking every last shard off that turkey carcass and making the feast last.Simply having a wrapping-free Christmas timeThat moment when the floor is covered in torn wrapping paper is no longer a feelgood one. You can cram it into that bin liner as fast as you like, but the truth is that a lot of wrapping paper, particularly the fancy stuff with the glitter on, or foil or plastic incorporated, isnrsquot recyclable. Scots, a new guide by Zero Waste Scotland claims, are expected to use upwards of , miles of wrapping paper this Christmas. ldquoIf we were to cut that down by just a quarter we could save around , tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from being released into the atmosphere. Thatrsquos the same as , flights from Edinburgh to New York.Many novel solutions have been proposed this year, some of which have been published in an online guide to a sustainable Christmas by Zero Waste Scotland. One, popular in many eco guides this year, has been wrapping presents in scarfs, which are then reused. Better still, we could learn a lot from our elders. The careful removal of wrapping paper, to be folded and put away for next year, is something that used to be a common practice. Also, our lives are littered in paper, whether newspapers or childrenrsquos artwork, which could be creatively repurposed.Have yourself a plastic-free Christmas crackerCrackers have also come in for a lot of stick this year. All that paper and cardboard waste, not to mention the useless little plastic whistles and magnying glasses which get chucked the moment that the table is cleared. But there are solutions. John Lewis is selling plastic-free crackers, with gts made from metal, glass and paper. Although, isnrsquot that just more pointless waste  Better, surely, to stick to, or even make, the kind of cracker that only delivers a party hat and a joke All I want for Christmas is youWe donrsquot have to give up gt-giving all together, just get more thoughtful about it. The climate emergency invites us to break a few taboos and establish new norms ndash for instance, to blatantly regt, or to give items that are second-hand. Last year, a friend passed on to me some pristine stocking-fillers that her kids had received the previous year but never used. I shamelessly stuffed them into my own kidsrsquo stockings.If you want to be really ethical, of course, you can gt charity donations. But the problem with that is that it doesnrsquot quite satisfy that desire many of us have to treat our loved ones. Low-emission ways of doing that include creating your own personal gt card, offering time or some other experience-related treat ndash a series of babysitting sessions, or to fix a bike, or cook a special meal. Again check out the Zero Waste Scotland guide.Last Christmas I bought a new jumper. The very next day I gave it awayThis year, to save us all from tears, you might want to consider rewearing last yearrsquos jumper or party frock, and keeping it going for another few seasons. Remember, % of human carbon emissions come from the fashion industry, and those nice fleecy Christmas tops leach microplastics into the environment. That said, the plus side of a nice fluffy Christmas jumper is that it might lead you to turn the thermostat down a click and cut a few emissions that way.Rockinrsquo around the live Christmas treeThe debate has raged for years between whether itrsquos better to get an articial tree or a real one.

To the Conservative Partys dismay, the TV regulator, Ofcom, sided with the block of ice.Elsewhere on the dial, the BBC has been the target of unprecedented criticism for alleged bias in favour of the Conservatives. Two editing errors, one of which removed laughter from a clip of Boris Johnson in an earlier debate, became the justication for a social media tirade against the corporation. The clips have been watched and shared many times more than any of the TV debates.The BBCs political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has been widely portrayed, unfairly, as a Government spokeswoman. Contrariwise, Andrew Neil, who used to be attacked for having right-wing views, became an unlikely Twitter hero when his piece to camera condemning Boris Johnsons non-appearance on his show went viral. The block of ice, it seems, was otherwise engaged.Social media had been encroaching on the conventional press and media in the last two elections this time it came close to eclipsing them altogether. Analysis by Research Reality suggests that people are increasingly consuming political news through fragmented and partisan clips on their mobile phones, rather than from watching TV debates or reading articles. Politics has merged with entertainment. Comedians are now as influential as journalists or even politicians in shaping attitudes.Young people derive their political information almost exclusively from the internet, with its preoccupations about race and gender identity. Labour, with its media-savvy Momentum shock-troops, has dominated the new medium, churning out memes, jokes and provocative videos. If this were an election for the under-s, Jeremy Corbyn would already be measuring the curtains in Number . Hes called ldquothe absolute boy.Boris Johnson is portrayed as a Bullingdon blowhard, a racist, misogynist and, above all, a liar. Each speech and interview is tracked by a flotilla of ldquofact check posts of ying quality demonstrating that his pants are on fire. These are amplied by comedians and commentators condemning the Tories for being in the pockets of billionaires, letting children starve and for harbouring Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Eton-educated Leader of the House has been kept well away from microphones since his suggestion that people consumed in the Grenfell Tower blaze lacked common sense.Labour has had its own image problems, of course, not least the charge of anti-Semitism that simply wont go away. Last week an extraordinary dossier of allegations from  Labour current party staff, compiled for the forthcoming Equalities Commission investigation into anti-Semitism, was leaked at a crucial moment in Labourrsquos campaign. The leaders of all the major UK religious faiths had earlier condemned Jeremy Corbyn for failing to stamp out hatred towards Jews in Labour ranks. A succession of Labour candidates have been dumped for trading in anti-Semitic imagery and tropes.Mind you, a number of Tory and SNP candidates have also been dropped over anti-Semitism. One of the SNP casualties, Neale Hanvey, in the key target seat of Kirkcaldy, has not gone quietly. He enlisted the support of many in the Yes movement, including the outspoken nationalist blogger Wings Over Scotland, aka Stuart Campbell, who has urged supporters to vote for Hanvey on Thursday.Then, in a bizarre twist, the SNPs conduct investigator on the Hanvey case, Denise Findlay, also resigned. Someone revealed that she too had tweeted last year that: ldquoIt is not anti-Semitic to call Israel a Nazi state. Many of Campbellrsquos readers believe these candidates have been casualties of a growing factional ision in SNP ranks, mainly fought on social media, between transgender activists and members, like Hanvey and Findlay, who oppose self-ID.This winnowing of candidates would have been unimaginable in previous elections. It demonstrates again how social media has become a parallel battleground even at constituency level. Candidates social media accounts are ransacked for dodgy remarks. Twitter has taken on the character of a McCarthyite inquisition.The Big Issues, like taxation and spending, have taken a back seat. Labour evidently decided that it was no longer necessary in the social media age to be cautious about spending pledges. In for a penny in for a billion. The Labour manesto is bold and radical, and has been compared to the  Labour manesto of Clement Attlee. It also involves the biggest peacetime increase in Government spending.Labour is planning to spend and invest a grand total of pound billion over five years, to be financed, improbably, by a % tax on those earning over pound, . And this is only for its declared spending. The Labour manesto ldquoGrey Book did not include the cost of a four-day week, freezing the pension age or nationalising a raft of industries like energy and rail.It is easy to pick holes in the Labour programme, not least in the uncosted poundbn that Labour belatedly offered to the so-called Waspi women, who feel they lost out when the pension age for women was equalised with that of men. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was scathing about the Labour programme in general and that in particular.However, the influential IFS was scathing about all the parties programmes. It said the Tories promise of no increase in income tax, VAT or National Insurance is unsustainable. It also criticised the SNPs proposals, adding that independence would lead to greater austerity than under the Conservatives. This blanket condemnation of the respective parties numbers meant that the spending issue was largely neutralised as the campaign progressed. In the social media scrum, fiscal issues have hardly registered.Focus groups suggest that most voters do not believe Labours promises are credible, however. There has been an air of desperation about Corbyn offering free broadband, cheap rail tickets, lower rents, free childcare, free elderly care, cheaper fuel etc. Labour claimed this week that families will gain pound, a yearthey win the election. Its a shameless exercise in retail politics, but that doesnt mean it isnt effective.The Conservative manesto, by contrast, offers thin gruel. It does include increases in spending but only around poundbn a year, mainly on health, police and gigabit broadband. But the increases mostly restore the cuts made by the Tories in these areas since . The proposal for  new hospitals looks provisional at best and the promise of , nurses includes ,  already employed by the NHS.If you want free stuff, and are prepared to suspend disbelief, Labour certainly sounds attractive ndashyou live in England, that is. Most of the headline measures like free personal care, free tuition fees, free childcare and higher health spending, are already in place in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon said, with some justication, that Labours manesto was a ldquocut and paste job of the SNPs record in office.However, not even the SNP has proposed borrowing on the scale Labour envisage. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, wants to spend poundbn alone on retooling the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. Electrication of transport, planting two billion trees, investing in green industries. There has been a greater tolerance of government borrowing in this campaign, largely because the Conservatives have stopped using their old language of austerity: of ldquospending what we can afford.Both main parties are saying, in effect, that now is the time to invest because the cost of borrowing has signicantly reduced.

And when it comes to such protests the French are not known for doing things by halves.In all an estimated , people over the past few days have taken part in demonstrations around the country, , of them in the capital Paris, according to a union organiser.: David Pratt on Frances desert warThe Efel Tower and other businesses in the city closed down and security authorities formed a barricade around the presidential palace. Authorities also deployed over , police officers to control protests and marches.Across the country schools were shut, flights cancelled and transport systems disrupted, and this may only just be the start.The fresh round of social unrest is once again calling into question Macronrsquos top down government style, which was a major factor in last yearrsquos protest over poor wages and dwindling living standards.The current strike pits Macron, a -year-old former investment banker who came to power in  on a promise to open up Francersquos highly regulated economy, against a trade union movement that say he is set on dismantling workersrsquo rights and protections.ldquoNo one can fail to see the clouds of social grievance that have gathered over France, observed Alexis Moreau a journalist and French labour movement researcher, writing about the crisis in the political magazine Tribune a few days agoldquoBrought to power by an electoral bloc mostly consisting of top managers, company bosses, and well-off pensioners, Emmanuel Macron has pursued a neoliberal agenda that has deepened the ides in French society, Moreau added.Many French citizens agree and sympathy for the strike has been fuelled by frustration over Macronrsquos wider economic record. Critics of the president for example point to the fact that while he continues to chip away at the welfare state and slashes unemployment benefits, Francersquos rich get off lightly.This after all they argue is a country with more than  billionaires and where French companies last year paid out more idends to shareholders than anywhere  in continental EuropeFor his part Macron, following what some say was a political victory in neutering last years protests, promised to adopt a more inclusive approach. He would listen to other voices he said and take stock of their grievances, but evidence of that to date say detractors remains scant.ldquoThe victory doesnrsquot seem to have rehabilitated Macron. This weekrsquos protest is the reflection of a crisis in French society, one that can explode at any moment, said Jean Garrigues, a political historian at the University of Orleans, speaking to the New York Times. ldquoTherersquos real anxiety over the future, Garrigues warned.At the core of the current unease causing unrest across France is what Macron refers to as his ldquoBig Bang overhaul of the countryrsquos near sacred pension scheme, which comprises more than  dferent plans, many with dferent retirement ages and benefits.In theory, everyone in France retires at . In reality however the average real retirement age is , but that number masks a host of disparities. The average age for men is just over , but some people mostly, women with fragmented careers, have to work until they are .But some pension schemes, especially for certain state employees, de-facto subsidised by other workers, are exceptionally generous. Train drivers, mariners and Paris Opera House ballet dancers for instance are able to retire at the age of , up to a decade earlier than the average worker.At the moment French retirees receive average state pensions of  per cent of their final earnings according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . This is less than Italybut far more than Germanyand the UK .Given such complexities in France however, past attempts at pension reforms have ended badly. Former president Jacques Chiracrsquos conservative government in  caved into union demands after weeks of crippling protests and lost a parliamentary election  months later.: France strikes: roads blocks and railways shutThe question now is whether Macron can weather the current political storm or will he suffer the same fate as Chirac Underlining how serious the crisis is for the president, the French daily Le Monde on Thursday called it ldquothe moment of truth for Macron.Not pulling any punches, the newspaper insisted that the next few days ldquoare a decisive test for the head of state.According to Macron the existing pension system is unfair and too costly. He wants a single, points-based system under which for each euro contributed, every pensioner has equal rights, or so the thinking goes. The accumulation of these points throughout a personrsquos working le would then be translated into a monthly salary at the point they retired.Supporters of Macronrsquos reforms say the points-based pensions system has a number of advantages. First, it gives iniduals a great deal of autonomy. They can choosethey want to retire at  or . Second, it offers obvious incentives. Someone who retires at  will get a better pension than someone on the same salary that decides to stop working aged .The schemes simplicity, equality of treatment and, above all, transferability say these supporters makes it an attractive proposition, but others are far less convinced.According to French labour movement researcher Alexis Moreau, currently pension levels for those in the private sector are set on the basis of a workerrsquos twenty-five best years or in the case of state employees the last six months of their career. But under Macronrsquos reform proposals their salary would now instead be calculated on the basis of their entire active period.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be a rocket scientist to work out that most wage earners would lose out from this, starting with those whose working lives were hit by periods of unemployment, says Moreau.Around France she says, ldquoworking people have been getting out their calculators to work out how much theyrsquore set to lose.Other observers agree that there are serious built in discrepancies. Veteran journalist John Lichfield who was Paris correspondent for the Independent for  years, says there will inevitably be many losers as well as gainers from the Macron scheme.ldquoNurses for example, have already pointed out that their pension regime has a  billion euro surplus, while the lawyersrsquo fund is  billion euros in the black, wrote Lichfield in the online current affairs magazine Politico.ldquoOther funds, such as those forworkers, are chronically loss making. Teachers, poorly paid early in the careers, say that they would lose outtheir pensions were decided by letime ldquopoints rather than ldquofinal salary, Lichfield added.Some critics also point to flaws in the execution of Macronrsquos reforms, suggesting he has left it too late in his presidential term to undertake such substantial changes.Itrsquos a narrow window of opportunity they say to push through such reforms, after which leaders like Macron no longer have enough political capital to expend on changes that risk losing public support.This certainly appears to be the case right now in France where the political storm clouds continue to gather menacingly over the Elysee Palace.Yet the unpopularity in some quarters with Macronrsquos pension reforms sits in sharp contrast with some opinion poll ratings which are said to have climbed to the high s and low s, unusually high for a French mid-term president.But as the crisis rumbles on, Macrons pension tsar Jean-Paul Delevoye is due to hold talks with the unions on Monday before the Prime Minister Edouard Philippe presents the broad outlines of the proposal to the public mid-week.:Emmanuel Macron stands his ground, saying Nato suffering from brain death and needs clearer strategyLast Friday however French union leaders said public workers in opposition to the reforms should maintain their industrial action until Tuesday, when they urged members to again flood the streets.ldquoUnions will meet on Tuesday evening to decide on our next actionsby then Macron and Philippe have not reversed course and opened negotiations, Catherine Perret of the left wing CGT union told reporters.The current strikes are being seen as a test of strength for the French trade union movement, which has been more defensive since the  economic crisis. For those hard-left unions whose membership and influence have diminished in recent years, the crisis poses a delicate tightrope walk of needing to pressure Macron and the government while not creating a public backlash.In Paris last Thursday, gilets jaunes protesters who posed a signicant challenge to Macronrsquos agenda with anti-government demonstrations last year joined union marchers. But Thursdayrsquos march was also much larger than any yellow vest protest, underlining the threat level and unease among wider sections of French workers and society.ldquoThe government is truly afraid of the scale of the mobilisation, Bertrand Hammache, a CGT union official at the RATPwas quoted as saying last Thursday.ldquoIt has begun bilateral meetings with each union to try and reassure us over what the reform means, and give us a reason to give up on the strike. But thatrsquos out of the question, Hammache insisted.But not all unions agree. Francersquos biggest and most moderate trade union federation, the CFDT for example, broadly supports Macronrsquos reforms, while some unions have failed to agree on a common front against them.By far the biggest fear for the moment though is the potential for violent protests stirred up by members of groups from the hard right and left of the political spectrum. In central Paris last Thursday police used tear gas when hooded protesters on the fringes of the trade unionsrsquo march threw fireworks at officers, ransacked bus stops, and set fire to rubbish bins.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: French economy minister Emmanuel Macron appears on The Andrew Marr Show \" class\"editor-image\"French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner has warned that thousands of anarchist ldquoblack bloc and hardcore ldquoyellow vest protesters, who last year took to the streets for months over the cost of living and perceived elitism of the political class, might try to wreak havoc.Some observers however have also expressed concern that far from being confined to Macron and France itself, the crisis poses a much wider danger. Writing in her column inlast week French journalist Natalie Nougayrede suggested that extreme forces across Europe are busily ldquorejoicing over Macronrsquos gilets jaunes predicament.According to Nougayredersquos assessment, ldquofrom Britainrsquos hardline Brexiteers to Italyrsquos far right strongman Matteoi Salvini, not to mention Putinrsquos propaganda outlets, the relish is unmistakable.Certainly there is little doubt that Macronrsquos championing of liberals and pro-Europeans has not gone down well with some of those leaders he has criticised for targeting migrants and political opponents.Perhaps sensing Macronrsquos vulnerability at this precise moment, some have been quick to exploit his dficulties at home in France. On a similar tack, there are pressing questions too as to how much the current strike could damage Macronrsquos wider international standing.Itrsquos worth remembering that just as things were brewing up at home, other leaders put Macron on the spot last week during the NATO Summit in London, where he clashed with US President Donald Trump during a tense press conference.But without doubt itrsquos on his home turf that Macron faces his toughest battle for now. Should he not blink over his controversial pension policy, then doubtless the gas masks and barricades will again be the norm on the streets of Paris this week.Back in  while serving as Prime Minster of France, Edgar Faure once wryly observed that, ldquoFrance is always early to revolt, because it is always late to reform.Pension reform is never an easy political sell, not least in France and might yet well prove a make or break moment for Macron on many levels.

While Scotland it made Scotlands limit the lowest in the UK, many European countries had lower limits still.Prior to the change there were warnings that many on-trade licensed premises would close, and the Scottish Licensed Trade Association has since claimed businesses have lost up to  per cent of their takings, costing Scottish pubs millions of pounds a year.But in the first study of its kind, experts at the University of Stirling interviewed owners and managers of on-trade premises ndash such as pubs, restaurants and nightclubs ndash to understand how the legislation had affected their businesses.The team found that while proprietors said the ban had led to fewer people drinking after work and more leaving premises earlier on weekdays, most reported no long-term financial impact on their business.Some had made adaptations in anticipation of the law change, including building in other sources of revenue, by improving the range of food on offer and expanding provision of non-alcohol and low alcohol drinks.Dr Niamh Fitzgerald, an Associate Professor in the Institute of Social Marketing at Stirling, led the study. She said there had been considerable vocal opposition to the legislation from those who feared the commericla impact. \"We observed instances of this in the run up to ndash and in the months following ndash the change of Scotlandrsquos drink-drive laws,\" she said. ldquoThis study found that businesses in the study had adapted to the change and reported little long-term economic impact.\"She said the study could influence debates in other countries still considering lower drink-drive limits, where similar controversies are prominent.\"The findings are of international relevance as lower drink-drive limits are being considered in other countries, with debates including discussions around the impact on business,\" she said.The study involved interviews with  owners and managers of on-trade premises in Scotland in , focusing on the impact on profits, changes in customer drinking behaviour, changes in the way customers travel and adaptations they had made to their businesses.Most participants were supportive of the change, and the majority said their had been no effect on their profit or that it had been short term before ing to normal.Rural pubs in the study were more likely to report a negative economic impact, while urban food-led establishments were less likely to do so ndash as customers continued to eat out, switching alcohol for soft drinks.The general perception was that people had stopped drinking altogethertehy were driving - rather than cutting down - following the official message that the \"best advice is none\"The after work drinker, the next morning drinker and the lunchtime drinker were seen as having been most affected by the change.Many businesses made changes to adapt to the new law.

What it said was % want to stay in the UK and % donrsquot, which is pretty much the same as the result in . There have been changes since then obviously ndash and the YouGov poll is one of the biggestndash but support for independence hasnrsquot collapsed. Far from it. The main lesson of the polls is that most of the support for Yes, and No, is ingrained at around the mid to high s.Which leaves the bit in the middle: the voters who appear to have been shting to Yes but may now be shting to No before changing back to Yes again, who knows. Therersquos no exact political science here, but I think the results in , as well as some of the voters Irsquove spoken to, and the YouGov poll, provide some clues. On the whole, these voters in the middle are progressive, Left-leaning and inclined towards Laboursome went over to Yes in  and never went back others, the nouveau nationalists, are more volatile. Itrsquos this group that will probably decide how it all pans out in the end.:Nicola Sturgeon suggests EU vote would take place before indyrefAs for trying to establish exactly who the nouveau nationalists are, the result of the independence referendum is important. At either end of the scale in , you had those who vote Conservative and those who vote SNP % of the Conservatives voted No and % of the SNP supporters voted Yes. But look at the figures for Labour ndash they were much more evenly ided at % for No and % for Yes Labour voters, or at least voters on the left, are much more likely to be switherers, or sympathetic to Yes, or undecided.Irsquove seen this for myself when Irsquove spoken to people campaigning on the ground for Yes. I particularly remember one woman I met: a lady from Ayrshire in her s called Marie, who switched to Yes and the SNP after a letime of voting Labour. Marie had always taken the view that socialism was an international movement and you should care just as much about the poor in Gateshead as you do for the poor in Glasgow and therefore vote No to independence.But then she remembered two things. She remembered Margaret Thatcher condemning Nelson Mandela as a terrorist while Glasgow was giving him the freedom of the city. And she remembered the Scottish Government freeing the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Both of those things, Marie told me, made her think: lsquoScotland can be dferentrsquo.Marie is self-evidently not alone: Irsquove spoken to lots of Left or Left-adjacent voters whorsquove come to the same conclusion. But for every Marie Irsquove spoken to, Irsquove also spoken to other voters on the Left who are not so certain or have come to a dferent view. Traditional Labour voters have gone both ways and those whorsquove gone for Yes make up the vast majority of the new recruits to independence. Certainly, whenever Irsquove spoken to people among the Yes grassroots, itrsquos hard to find anyone whorsquos ever regularly voted LibDem or Tory.This is signicant because it helps explain the vote in the middle-ground between Yes and No and its changeability, particularly in an election dominated by Brexit. Those on the Left are more likely to be Remainers and to be concerned about the effects of Brexit on society and therersquos a crossover with Yes supportersndash the YouGov poll found support for independence among those who voted Remain was %, more than twice what it was among Leavers.The problem here for the Yes campaign is that left-leaning Remainers do not always reach the same conclusion about Scottish nationalism, Brexit and Labour, which may help explain the drop in support for independence. Nouveau nationalists whorsquove been flirting with Yes are now faced with the chance of a Corbyn governmentthey are also faced with the possibility of a Tory win and a Boris Brexit.:General Election: Key Scottish battlegroundsSo what will they do  On the face of it, it would seem logical that the chances of Brexit and a Tory win would send progressive, Remainer voters rushing into the arms of the SNP and Yes, but itrsquos not as simple as that. As professor of politics Rob Johns pointed out to The Herald on Sunday, the Brexit effect may have highlighted the dficulties independence could bring. And for some nouveau nationalists, this is particularly troubling:Brexit is bad for the economy and hurts the weakest in society, what on Earth will independence do Other factors may be at play in the dip in support for independence. Some voters may be leaning a little more towards Corbyn and therefore a little further away from independence because of the election campaign. Butthatrsquos true, it wonrsquot necessarily translate into votes for Labour in Scotland. Thatrsquos the weird, unpredictable thing about modern politics: Scotland used to be ided by Right and Left, now itrsquos ided by No and Yes and thatrsquos had a profound effect on party loyalties itrsquos all a lot more fluid than it was.Which means, ultimately, that what the nouveau nationalists decide to do could be crucial. We already know that some voters in Scotland will vote tactically against the SNP, which is why support for the Tories in Scotland has been rising. But we also know that there are voters who separate a vote in a general election from a vote in an independence referendum, which is why some unionists will vote for the SNP this time because of Brexit.But the real battle ndash in the general election and in another referendum on independence ndash is in the middle-ground over left-leaning, Labour-inclined voters. Another poll at the weekend showed that only % of SNP-minded voters and % of Tories might change their mind about who to vote for at this election, but for people minded to support Labour that shoots up to %. These are the voters in the choppy waters between Labour and the SNP, Leave and Remain, and Yes and No. What they decide to do will decide our future."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-labour-uk-government-diminish-appetite-independence","story":"In an interview with the PA News agency ahead of the vote on December , the Scottish Labour leader said his partyrsquos plans to invest in public services and communities across the country would offer a radical change to the Tories after a decade of austerity.Read more:Jackson Carlaw insists lsquonothing to be afraid ofrsquo in Nicola SturgeonHe said Labour would commit to abolishing the House of Lords ndash replacing it with a second chamber for the nations and regions ndash in a bid to decentralise power in the UK.We have one week to change the course of our countryrsquos history.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yet nothing is certain. Boris Johnson could still miss the goal spectacularly like Diana Ross famously missed that penalty at the ‘ World Cup opening ceremony.He undoubtedly has flair and talent, but can he be trusted to deliver  That has been the central issue that has limited his undoubted appeal and held him back from achieving an unassailable lead.At the outset of the campaign I argued that the election was Boris Johnson’s to lose. The danger facing him was that having benefitted from the public’s growing sense of grievance about Parliament obstructing the deliverance of Brexit he might be drawn into fighting on the ground of his opponents choosing where he could be more easily beaten. He might lose points on the NHS, he might be outflanked on social care or ridiculed for increasing police numbers that his party originally cut. Whatever the issue, Johnson had to remind the public that the general election had been called earlier than should be expected, and thatthey truly wanted to end their boredom and exhaustion with Brexit they must make a choice between giving him a majority – or sending him packing.In the end, from my own admittedly subjective viewpoint, Johnson has managed to hold on to a diminished lead because his main opponents have been unable to land any signicant blows. Indeed the very question of being able to trust Johnson that has been levelled at him by other leaders such as Corbyn, Sturgeon and Swinson has only raised the questions of trust in them.Labour’s revered Aunt Sally – the threat posed to the NHS by the dreaded Tories – becomes less convincing each time she is wheeled out in her bathchair. Thanks to the changing demographics a lot more demand is putting a strain on resources and with changing technology the costs rise further. NHS costs keep going up and this will not change whichever party governs the nation. Labour can argue you can’t trust the Tories on the NHS all it wants but it rings hollow when we know they say this every election and that every time they are in office they increase spending on the NHS – even during the period of austerity when other departments had their budgets cut.Nor do the attacks from Labour and the SNP about the threat of privatisation of NHS services have credibility.Their idea was to use President Trump as a bogey man but my MEP colleague Henrik Overgaard-Nin, a practising dentist and former head of the General Dental Practice Committee, utterly demolished this thesis last week by categorising how it has been the European Union forcing the growth of private provision of services in the NHS. Likewise it is the EU that was pushing a trade deal with President Obama that could have opened up the NHS further.In all of these points it is those such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson who by fighting to deliver Brexit are the real defenders of the NHS remaining accountable to the British electorate.In Scotland, the claims of Nicola Sturgeon are especially weak. The scandals of the tragic and avoidable deaths of children in Glasgow’s new infirmary due to contaminated water, and the unopened Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh costing an extra £ million that leaves her especially vulnerable to an accusation of rank hypocrisy. Claims about trust on law and order under Johnson – made after his promise to recruit , more police in England when it was the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats who originally reduced their numbers following the great recession – have no value when put by other parties who have their own records to feel ashamed about. This week in London the th murder was committed, surpassing last year’s total of  with three weeks of  still to go. The comparison of Johnson’s record as London mayor against the current Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, puts labour in the dock, not the Tories. Likewise the state of Scottish policing was brought into sharp focus by the resignation of Susan Deacon as the chair of the Scottish Police Authority claiming its governance and accountability is fundamentally flawed.While the issue of trust has undoubtedly undermined the Boris Johnson campaign it has not been a knockout blow, for sadly too many politicians come with the same reputational challenge about trust. Nicola Sturgeon promised the  independence referendum was “once in a generation” then “once in a letime” vote but started campaigning for a second referendum practically from the moment her campaign was defeated. At first she was careful enough to suggest it might take a few years but now, five years on and she has been pressing incessantly for a second vote – certainly not a generation later.Corbyn has his reputational problem with past associations with terrorist groups and now wishes to take our industrial relations back to the unrest of the seventies. Then there is labour’s ant-Semitism problem. Do people really trust Jeremy Corbyn The largest issue of trust for me is Johnson’s claim that only he can “get Brexit done”. It is proving a convincing slogan with the public fit to burst over the incessant parliamentary infighting and sharp practices to deliver a deal that suits the EU and leaves our country ided. I do not accept Boris’s “deal’ is anything other than an attempt to move the issue out of the public eye and play down the further capitulations of the UK’s interest that are yet to come. I fully expect the Prime Minister to get his majority and therefore get his deal through parliament – but I do not expect him to secure anything like the free trade deal with the EU that he claims is within his gt, nor do I expect him to go for leaving without a deal – so I foresee yet another extension to our membership after the end of .That’s why we need Brexit Party MPs to press Johnson to deliver, without them millions will have no voice. I would like to think I am wrong but this Brexit General Election could well prove fruitless and undermine public trust in politicians even more.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch brexit won t get done if boris wins an snp backed labour government is safer bet","story":"#Getting Brexit done# will simply continue to overshadow everything , says Lesley Riddoch.If the Tories get a working majority on Thursday, as predicted, will Boris Johnson actually get Brexit done  Will politicsto something like normal Even at a time of fairytales, flying reindeer, Wise Men and Tinkerbell most adults realise the answer to both questions is a resounding no.Passing Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreementmarks only the end of the beginning – the first stage of a bitter, contested orce which moves on to the financial settlement and future trade negotiations. These must be concluded more speedily than any similar deal in political history andthe shambolic UK negotiating team fails – by accident or by design – the inhabitants of Britain will face the same “no deal” clf edge next Christmas that was supposedly seen off in .This much we know. Every news bulletin and parliamentary debate will continue to be dominated by Brexit in . Uncertainty will blight investment, job security, le-plans, recruitment and the quality of public services. The unbelievable total of , nursing vacancies in the English NHS will not diminish but increase as EU workers finally depart for good. There will be no Golden Age for public services – why should there be when the new boss is actually the old boss  At a deeper level, how can Brexit ever “get done” when leaving is bitterly opposed by millions of voters who will neither abandon their commitment to European identity, nor be accommodated in any way by the new Prime Minister. Thus, Europe will only become more isive and totemic as an issue and will continue to distract from the seismic issues of inequality, climate crisis, and democratic modernisation the entire British political system has chosen to ignore. Most Tory voters and even Brexit supporters know this in their hearts.They back Boris, not to get Brexit done but because he’s the one who lets them dream a while longer, indulges make-believe, allows disorientated people to take respite from the bleakness and empty affluence his party has created with the vain hope of making Britain great again. No harsh realities, dficult choices or tough reappraisals from Santa Johnson. You only have to believe in his magical powers, his innate superiority and his bona fides. Or pretend. It’s like an electoral version of the Stockholm syndrome. Some depressing yet powerful human dynamics are at work.So, a Boris win is likely – but looking on the bright side, a Tory majority would change the thrust of political debate in early .Firstly, it would rob Boris Johnson of the chance to keep posing as the champion of The People against an evil, unresponsive, high-handed Remainer Parliament. If he becomes Prime Minister again, that “self-serving political elite” will largely be his own hand-picked “do or die” foot-soldiers. Any mistakes, delays, crassness or missed deadlines will be entirely and demonstrably his fault and no-one ’s. Alienated Tory big beasts like John Major will join with expelled grandees like Michael Heseltine to rub the new leader’s nose in it – and he must watch for signs of mutiny amongst hisloyal band of lieutenants Gove, Hancock, Javid and Raab – all of whom wanted to be leader themselves. At the first sign of trouble they could try to challenge Johnson, supported by Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May on the backbenches, nursing their wrath to keep it piping hot.Boris may be the darling of the Tory Party membership, but he will have very few friends in Parliament or , in the capital city. Is Johnson an accomplished political tightrope walker – we may soon find out.Secondly, an overall majority would probably also rob Boris of his best recruiting sergeant – Jeremy Corbyn. Not even Teflon Tony could have withstood the sustained and concerted hatchet-job Corbyn has faced every waking day for the last five weeks. The Labour leader has made the media’s job easier than it needed to be, but he’s also overseen a much-needed policy alignment. If Labour’s popular programme of renationalisation and public ownership is wedded to a new, more articulate and assertive leader – Boris will face real, spirited political opposition every inch of the way in . Thirdly, a Boris working majority would also end the absurdity of Arlene Foster and the DUP \u2028representing the views of Remain voting Northern Ireland. Greens and other small parties won’t stand against some Alliance and SDLP candidates, so there’s a chance Ms Foster’s personal authority will be seriously clipped – and that this could precipitate the much-predicted break-up of Britain.Astonishingly, it’s influential parts of the London media who’ve decided that’s on the cards.Channel Four anchor Jon Snow is travelling around the Celtic nations, making a series of films about dissatisfaction in the devolved nations. Radio Four’s flagship World this Weekend is planning an hour-long debate on the future of the United Kingdom for next week. Doubtless, more is planned.It’s ironic. The Conservatives have won elections in the teeth of fierce opposition from Scots for decades. But Brexit has finally thrown that crushing unfairness into sharp relief and a supportive media spotlight. So too have recent opinion polls which suggest a majority of Scots would support independenceBoris Johnson triggers withdrawal from the EU. London’s sudden interest in Scotland’s constitutional bind is welcome, but dangerous too. Enthusiasm may soon waneScots don’t live up to our newfound billing as the Remain rebels who Won’t Stand For Brexit. Unfairly, since no smaller member of this “family of nations” has yet found a way to exercise authority or be heard. But the British media doesn’t do fair, patient, marginal or incremental. So, the pressure will not relent. Brexit won’t get doneBoris wins the vote. And an SNP-supported Corbyn government is still a much better bet. Butthe worst happens, Nicola Sturgeon will have an opportunity to assert bold political leadership.

And nothing on Islamophobia within the Conservative Party.Admittedly the splash headline “Corbyn has made Labour a welcoming refuge for anti-Semites” was legitimate. It was taken from the Jewish Labour Movement’s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commissioninquiry. And what a damning submission it was.It said the party to which its members belonged “promotes anti-Semites to positions of power does not take actionagainst those guilty of abhorrent anti-Semitism victimises those who speak out against anti-Semitism fails to protect Jewish members from anti-Semitism allows Jewish MPs to be hounded out of their political home and derides the issue of anti-Semitism to the extent that its very existence within the party is denied.” Such criticism was not unexpected. In the past decade Corbyn has been involved in a succession of incidents – from his defence of an anti-Semitic mural in Tower Hamlets to the glowing foreword he wrote to a book laden with anti-Semitic tropes – which appeared to validate suggestions he was fostering a culture of racism. To understand the impact this has had on Jewish members one need only look as far as East Renfrewshire – home to the largest Jewish community in Scotland. For more than  years this constituency ed Jim Murphy, Blairite and one-time member of the Labour Friends of Israel group, as its MP. Last week, the current Labour candidate Carolann Davidson told a Glasgow Jewish Representative Councilhustings the Labour Party did not deserve their vote. She said she’d only come to reassure them some Labour politicians refused to surrender to racism.With Jewish MPs including Luciana Berger forced out, you would have to be a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist to believe Corbyn was being ly smeared . You might wonderfive full pages on the EHRC investigation and no pages on – for example – the poverty that is blighting the lives of hundreds of thousands of children at Christmas – was politically motivated. And you might go on to surmise that, while all racism is equally bad, some forms of racism are less equally bad than others.While Corbyn is suffering as a result of his failure to address anti-Semitism, Boris Johnson is shrugging off quite blatant Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, such as Sally-Ann Hart’s claim that learning disabled people should earn less because “they don’t understand money.”We know Johnson is racist, because racist sentiments so often pop out of his racist mouth. He has talked about “piccaninnies with water melon smiles” and compared Muslim women to letter boxes. In , he described Islamophobia as the natural reaction to Islam, while in  he suggested Malaysian women coming to UK universities were looking for a man to marry.Like Corbyn, he has promised to root out the problem while continuing to support those who embody it. He promoted Zac Goldsmith to his cabinet despite Goldsmith’s Islamophobic London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan, and he continues to employ Tommy Robinson’s pal Chloe Westley as an aide.You can detect the same notes of betrayal in the voices of Berger and Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi, who described the past four years as like being in an abusive relationship. She spoke after discovering a promised internal investigation into Islamophobia was to be watered down to “an investigation into prejudice of all kinds”.The incidents of Islamophobia go all the way down into the grassroots of the party. Earlier this year, the Conservatives suspended  party members for a string of abusive social media posts, including one that called for all Muslims to be turfed out of public office.Then, last month,  sitting and former Tory councillors were suspended in another social media scandal in which one poster referred to Muslims as “the enemy within”.The party insists such suspensions are evidence of a zero tolerance approach. What, then, are we to make of ministers Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom and Thérèse Coffey, who have been out on the campaign trail supporting candidates facing claims of Islamophobia  Meanwhile Channel ’s misquoting of Johnson – it claimed he uttered he words: “people of colour” when, in fact, he said “people of talent” – is \u2028being touted as evidence he is not prejudiced. In fact it is merely evidence that, now and again, he remembers not to gt-wrap racist ideology in racist rhetoric.This “talent” quote is a sanitised expression of an immigration policy that created a hostile environment for asylum seekers and deported British citizens back to the West Indies. Let’s not get too outraged with C for mishearing something that, to most people, seemed entirely plausible. And, while criticising Corbyn for failing to apologise for anti-Semitism during his Andrew Neil interview, let’s not forget Johnson wouldn’t submit to the Neil interrogation. And that his response to questions about Islamophobia in the latest leaders’ debate was to change the subject back to Brexit.All this measuring of Labour and Tory sins should not be reduced to whataboutery. But it very often is. The way in which the partiesturn examples of their rivals’ racism into anti-ballistic missile systems capable of combating their own is demoralising This election should not be a game of bigotry Top Trumps. The Conservative Party’s racism does nothing to dilute the Labour Party’s nor ought there to be some hierarchy of hatred. Still, it is worth asking why there is so much focus on one type of racism, while another is seen as more trivial. And why – when the concept of anti-Semitism is rightly sacrosanct – the Spectator and other right-wing publications feel free to carry columns suggesting Islamophobia is a fiction created to silence criticism of fundamentalism  The consequences of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are almost identical: fear, hurt, and radicalisation within affected communities, and a rise in hate crime towards them. Othering is othering is othering. Whether you are a Hasidic Jew visiting the synagogue in Gfnock or a bearded Muslim attending a mosque in Pollokshields, the misery of being insulted, spat at or attacked is the same. It is to be hoped the EHRC launches an investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party as it has into anti-Semitism in Labour to reinforce that any form of racial discrimination is unacceptable and must be rooted out. And that – instead of posturing and preicating and pointing to each others’ flaws – all the parties will come to a consensus on the iniquity of religious ethnic hatred: for the sake of social cohesion and so their own exiled members canto the fold.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"clear during brexit talks that border checks would be needed says simon coveney","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These questions were not answered.At one stage during the interview, Connor was told by an officer \" you are acting under duress, tell us now and we will deal with it\". Connor declined to respond to this, and alsoshe was behind a claim of responsibility for the pipe bomb attack, which appeared on the Republican Network for Unitys Facebook page.During the seventh interview, a pre-prepared statement was handed to police via her solicitor, which claimed she was a member of WeightWatchers.In the statement, Connor said was in the Crumlin Road Ardoyne area at the time of the early morning incident, and made the case she was out walking as part of WeightWatchers exercise programme.The defendant also claimed she was walking near the Wineflair on the Crumlin Road when she heard two loud bangs that made her drop her mobile.

We all believe in what we say.\"South Antrim has gone under the radar as a key constituency, but in a couple of days time a fascinating battle will play out. Away from the rivalries around Belfast and in Foyle, this is perhaps the most hard-fought constituency and three parties think they can win.It has been a game of pass the parcel between the Ulster Unionists and the DUP for the last two decades.William McCrea won it for the DUP for the first time in a by-election in , after the death of Clford Forsythe, by less than , votes.

Paul Girvan is very active around the constituency and Danny Kinahan has built up a strong personal following. John Blair is relatively new on the scene but has made a big impression, Declan Kearney polls consistently well while Roisin Lynch is another with a great pedigree on a local level.\"You still have to have Girvan down as the favourite.\"Girvan is out in front as they head for the line. Kinahan has got a new lease of le and previous winning form while Blair is coming up fast in the rails.

So close to Belfast, but so dferent in attitude. data-dfpadtargetingJim ShannonAnother factor stacking against those lining up to challenge the DUP in Strangford is that only in north Antrim did a greater percentage of voters opt to vote Leave in the  EU referendum.For Shannons closest challenger, capitalising on the voters who have switched their European view from Leave to Remain will be key.\"Were in this to give Jim a good run for his money,\" said Kellie Armstrong. \"He has a strong majority and we respect him for that, but weve been slowly eating into that.\"The local government elections gave us a surge.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Read MoreConstituency Profile: DUPs Shannon all but certain to see off Alliance in StrangfordAds for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.Paul MaskeyThe mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Frank McCoubreyMr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Gerry CarrollMr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.MichaelThe compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief.

Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable.

In this election, we have an opportunity to send voices and votes to Westminster that can stand up for us and stand against the DUP. \"In this election we simply cant afford the luxury of voicing a strong protest.

When Sylvia Hermon spoke, she spoke for all of us. None of us viewed her through the silos of the traditional ide in Northern Ireland - she was our remain voice and she will be badly missed.\"Mr Eastwood said the election \"is a chance to maximise the Remain representation across Northern Ireland\". \"That is what motivated the SDLP to take a lead in making that ambition a reality and removing as many damaging DUP votes as possible,\" he said.\"That was a choice not about pacts but about protection - protecting us from Boris Johnson and protecting us from Brexit.\"The choice made by the SDLP was to be strategic, not selfish.\"Mr Eastwood dismissed suggestions from Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald that nothing could be gained by sitting in the Commons.He added: \"History doesnt judge those who dont turn up at defining moments - it casts a far harsher verdict. It simply doesnt mention them because they make no dference. You only make a dference by being there.\"He pointed to a number of issues - including fair employment legislation, creation of the PSNI, and pension rights for factory workers - all secured, he said, by his party being present on the green benches.He added: \"Ask anybody who can countthere is going to be a dference made by MPs sitting in Westminster. \"This thing could be decided on the basis of a couple of votes.

He said party officials only said they were \"looking at it\".\"And here we are, no DUP,\" he told his legion of listeners saying it was through the licence fee he was able to hold politicians to account so they could justy their actions.\"Thats why this is important,\" he said.\"Usually political parties fight for an opportunity to be on the BBC to sell their manestos.\"Every single party who were asked to have their manesto scrutinised by the Nolan show, have agreed a date, except one.\"We think it is important to scrutinise their manesto whether they are here or not.\"He said he \"deeply regretted\" the party would not appear on his show to answer his questions.On Facebook the show broadcast live an image of an empty chair with the DUP manesto sitting on it.Arlene FosterIn recent weeks broadcasters have taken the decision to empty chair politicians over their refusal to appear on shows during election campaigning. Sky News presenter Kay Burleys interrogation of an empty chair pulled in more viewers than any interview the absent Conservative chairman James Cleverly would have achieved had he appeared.And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism for his refusal to be interviewed by the BBCs Andrew Neil.In all, Stephen Nolan dedicated an entire hour to the DUP manesto with contributions from BBC political and business editors and callers to the programme.He said the DUP could have reached out to his over , listeners but \"theyve chosen not to do that\".\"There are so many questions I have for the DUP on your behalf and do you know what  I am going to ask them.\"He askedthe party was \"embarrassed\" about how Prime Minister Boris Johnson had treated them,its pursuit of Brexit had damaged the Union and why they were not ruling out working with the Conservative leader in the future given his treatment of the party which lauded him as a \"friend of unionism\".Pointing to recent polling which suggests the majority of unionists are now pro-remain he said he would have asked the party on it.Read MoreWho were the winners and losers  Suzanne Breens verdict on UTV election debateDUP accuses Boris Johnson of breaking his word on union commitmentThe presenter spoke for almost  minutes on what he wanted to ask the party, breaking up his monologue with prolonged silences.He asked about social issues such as health and how the party could convince the next generation of unionism why it was \"best in class\" on those matters beyond the traditional green and orange stances taken.On the money secured by the party for health Mr Nolan said he wanted to ask how how it prioritised the matter andit was further down the order than \"preventing an Irish language act\" in reference to the ongoing political impasse which has seen Northern Ireland go without local government for almost three years.Mr Nolan said it would have been interesting to hear the partys thoughts on that political deadlock and - given the ongoing healthcare workers industrial action - its thoughts on the millions spent on MLA salaries.He also askedthe party regretted breaking pay parity between Northern Ireland and GB health staff which helped bring about the current industrial action crippling healthcare.Stephen NolanOn the partys outreach to \"as wide a base as possible\" he askedthat included gay people andthe DUP was prepared to apologise for comments made by some of its members in the past on homosexuality andsimilar comments could be made again.\"Because politicians are being held to account in this election, they are answering questions about their past words,\" he continued.\"You say in your manesto you want to protect animals better - might you be minded to protect gay people better - and should they vote for you this time around \"Callers to the show congratulated Mr Nolan on proceeding with his show in the absence of the party.He confirmed Sinn Fein would be appearing on his show on Tuesday morning.\"The details of any manesto is important - every other political party has consented to me scrutinising the detail within their promises - except the DUP,\" said Mr Nolan.Sammy WilsonThe DUP has denied holding a boycott over the show although Sammy Wilson admitted it came to a \"collective decision\" to not appear on the show \"as the best way of hurting him\".\"I would just say to the DUP,there is no Nolan show boycott, why are you not here \" asked Mr Nolan.\"If it is even possible for people to think you cant face up to me - how have you got what it takes to face down Boris Johnson or Mary Lou McDonald when your voters need you to \"He added: \"There are loads of articulate, seasoned politicians who could have come in this morning that could have answered these questions - possibly quite well, possibly attracting you to vote for them - instead my questions on your behalf are met with silence.\"I hope I have been able to bring you some of the questions I would have asked the DUP and I deeply regret that I could not convince them to answer them.\"The DUP did not respond to a request for comment.A BBC spokeswoman added: \"In the run up to the election, the Nolan show has been examining manestos and bringing listeners its trademark political interviews with representatives from the main political parties. The DUP was invited on to the programme but did not provide a representative.

His media performances have been first-class, and this was no exception.Two SDLP advisers accompanied him to the debate, but he didn’t need them. From start to finish he was passionate, polished and professional. He was streets ahead of Michelle O’Neill. While he scored countless points against her, it wasn’t in a destructive way.His most successful moments were when he challenged Sinn Fein on abstentionism from a pragmatic, not ideological, position.He blew away the argument that going to Westminster made no practical dference.Whether we liked it or not, massive decisions were taken there, and MPs had already stopped Brexit several times. “We need to be there fighting against Boris Johnson, locking him out of Downing Street,” Eastwood said.He brushed off claims that this stance was at odds with pulling out of North Belfast for an abstentionist Sinn Fein candidate.“I’d much rather have John Finucane sitting in his house than Nigel Dodds sitting in the House of Commons,” he replied.There was a stinging one-liner to the DUP about how “no amount of Ulster Hall meetings or banging drums” would change things on Brexit. Eastwood’s words will have secured him no friends among unionists. But his eyes are focused on Foyle, and he may well have won over soft Sinn Fein voters with this sparky performance.Emma Little-Pengelly, DUPEmma Little-Pengelly DUP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.The word was that Nigel Dodds would stand in for Arlene Foster in this debate but the DUP opted for Emma Little-Pengelly as a substitute.She is fighting to retain her Westminster seat from the SDLP so prime-time media exposure helps. The outgoing South Belfast MP performed well given that she has considerably less experience than her rivals in such scenarios.Her opening statement was excellent. Her brief was obviously to mention the DUP’s £.bn confidence-and-supply money for Northern Ireland as often as possible. The repetition does get a little tedious. Naomi Long at one stage said the money was “a drop in the ocean” of what was needed to turn around public services here.Little-Pengelly didn’t have answers for some of the criticism her rivals made. On a Brexit plan, the best the DUP can come up with is that a hung Parliament is likely and it will exert its influence againholding the balance of power.Little-Pengelly did handle Steve Aiken’s assertive approach expertly. Her barrister training clearly helps.She came across as moderate and measured, and that will do her no harm in South Belfast.She held up her party’s manesto twice near the end of the debate. That is aimed not at the DUP’s core voters but at the middle-class unionist constituency whom the party wants to win over with its policy detail.Naomi Long, AllianceNaomi Long Alliance at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Naomi Long started nervously, and that is not like her. She and Steve Aiken were the only leaders to look at their notes during their opening statements.But from there on the Alliance leader was in top form. She tackled both the DUP and Sinn Fein very successfully several times.There were some stinging one-liners. Long insisted it wasn’t a choice between dealing with health and an Irish Language Act — “we can walk and chew gum at the same time”.In the health discussion, she raised Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and Little-Pengelly’s husband, which clearly is uncomfortable territory for the DUP.Less successful was Long’s metaphor about Brexit unicorns and donkeys. She has used it too many times and it has lost its appeal.The Alliance leader was totally honest about our NHS crisis, admitting there isn’t “a silver bullet or magic wand”.She was taking no prisoners regarding the DUP and Sinn Fein’s record of government at Stormont. Alliance, the SDLP and UUP sat around the Executive table while the two big parties sat in another room and carved things out between them, she said.Long came across as that rare breed — a straight-talking politician with integrity. This performance strengthens her image as someone who wants to get things done here but is frustrated by the obstinacy of others.Michelle O’Neill, Sinn FeinMichelle ONeill Sinn Fein at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.This was a typical Michelle O’Neill performance. She didn’t drop the ball, but neither did she run with it and score.Sinn Fein prefers script over spontaneity, and its vice-president stuck to that approach. Tory austerity was a get out-of-jail card whenever her party’s own record was raised.Her best line came when accusing DUP politicians of initial over-excitement about their influence at Westminster. “They’re now sobering up to the reality thatyou’re bought, you can be sold,” she said. The image of a drunk DUP will have raised smiles in a fair few homes. O’Neill’s weakest moment came when she was asked why there was only a single line in Sinn Fein’s manesto about health. “This election is all about Brexit,” she said.Neither had O’Neill answers as to why as Health Minister she didn’t reverse the DUP’s decision to end pay parity for health service workers here. In her favour, she came across as pleasant, and someone who can definitely do business with unionists. She is no bogeywoman..jpg\" title\"Sinn Fein Deputy leader Michelle ONeilland DUP South Belfast Candidate Emma Little-Pengelly during the recording of UTV election debate at the Queens Film studio in Belfast.

Indeed, with so much gusto that he faced allegations of aggression from Emma Little-Pengelly.There was an awkward moment during the Brexit segment when the DUP candidate tried to cut across the UUP leader. “Wait!,” he said firmly, and put up his hand. A male politician saying that to a female one just doesn’t look good, whatever the intention. It wasn’t helped by Aiken then saying to her: “Don’t tell me I’m wrong!”The UUP is taking an assertive approach towards its DUP rival in this election and that is tactically no bad thing. But the tone of this particular exchange was perhaps not the wisest. The substance of what Aiken said, unlike the delivery, was actually very good.The point that a border down the Irish Sea appeared on the DUP’s watch and “Arlene Foster, Nigel Dodds, Sammy Wilson and you Emma” bear responsibility will hurt the DUP. Although it may not lose that party support, as grassroots unionists seem to blame Boris Johnson alone for the Brexit betrayal. Aiken called for a health emergency to be declared here by London rather than waiting for theof devolution.He pointed out that when the UUP held Stormont’s Health Ministry there were , on our waiting list compared to , now. But his whole performance, unfortunately, just didn’t hang together."},{"url":null,"title":"all of the craziest things that went down at art basel miami","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, it wasn’t back in action for long and the installation was soon taken down as it was drawing too big a crowd and needed security guards to protect it.This isn’t the first time Cattelan’s work has been targeted – earlier this year his solid gold toilet was stolen from Blenheim Palace.A sofa was made out of Balenciaga off-cuts, px px  rgba margin: px max-width:px min-width:px padding: width:.% width:-webkit-calc width:calc\"       \" fill\"#\"  View this post on Instagram translateY\"translateX translateY width: .px flex-grow:  margin-right: px margin-left: px\"translateY\" translateY rotate\" \" \"translateX\"  Thank you for this INSANE opportunity to all Balenciaga @balenciaga team — Demna, Martina, Rain you make it come true ♻️♻️♻️   Today we opened the show at @designmiami   THE BALENCIAGA SOFA — BY HARRY NURIEV IN COLLABORATION WITH BALENCIAGA   @balenciaga @harrynuriev For Design Miami  , Balenciaga has collaborated with artist, architect, and furniture designer Harry Nuriev to advocate for environmental accountability by creating a al artwork using discarded Balenciaga clothing. The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy. A post shared by  Harry Nurievon Dec ,  at :am PSTLast year, artist Harry Nuriev had one of the most memorable installations of Art Basel Miami, putting together a Balenciaga office. He obviously knew he was onto a winner, because this year he yet again took inspiration from the fashion house – this time in the form of a sofa.Nuriev stuffed a large couch with off-cuts of Balenciaga clothes that weren’t going to be sold, making for an incredibly chic sitting situation. Giving it extra fashion credentials, model Bella Hadid even visited the installation and posed on it.Dior brought back a retro designer\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Dior Men’s creative director Kim Jones decided to hold his pre-fall  show in Miami to coincide with Art Basel. In doing so, he revived a name we haven’t heard in a long time: Shawn Stussy. That’s the man behind Stüssy, the skater brand which emerged in the s and arguably set a precedent for fashion’s obsession with streetwear and athleisure.While Stüssy is still actually going strong – evenit’s not quite at the height of its powers – Shawn Stussy himself hasn’t been in the game for a while, and came out of retirement to collaborate with Jones.Madonna’s daughter was in a simulated ‘orgy’, px px  rgba margin: px max-width:px min-width:px padding: width:.% width:-webkit-calc width:calc\"       \" fill\"#\"  View this post on Instagram translateY\"translateX translateY width: .px flex-grow:  margin-right: px margin-left: px\"translateY\" translateY rotate\" \" \"translateX\"  This is love dferent.

In his last letter to his brother, William, Boyd wrote: “Mark you that I die like a gentleman and a soldier.

Ferdinand VII had been restored to the throne by the British in , on condition that he ruled under the more liberal Constitution of . Unfortunately, Ferdinand reneged on this, preferring an autocratic approach to sovereignty. In , Ferdinand’s misrule provoked a revolt in favour of the  Constitution. Ferdinand was captured but then made promises for reform.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Indeed, it is fair to say that our group have been strong supporters of the initiative long before many of the current UU administration ever heard of it. Unfortunately, our city-region has so focused its attentions on this new school – which,UU ever gets its necessary permissions and finance, will have  students by  – that we have completely lost sight of the much bigger picture. Higher Education provision North West is at a catastrophically low level, it has been this way for  years, and our failure to address this crisis is resulting in lasting generational damage. googletag.cmd.push Moreover, the minimal university provision that is located here is controlled and taxed by Belfast and of no economic benefit to our region. Things have gotten so bad that our own Council was recently caught inflating student numbers on a trade mission in a bid to put a gloss on a very bad picture. UU, meanwhile, have spent the past decade playing a bizarre game of push-halfpenny, moving courses in and out of Magee in rapid succession in a bid to create the faccedilade of expansion. But the figures published by the Derry News last month show their manoeuvring to be nothing but a cynical exercise – we had fewer than  full-time university students in  and we still have fewer than  today. googletag.cmd.push And forget any meaningful UU expansion over the next  years. After spending, and borrowing, poundm-plus for the new white elephant campus in North Belfast, there is no money left for Derry. Not a doily. UU will predictably move a few le sciences courses here from Coleraine, for the short-term, to support their case for the medical school. Expect an announcement on this in the New Year to take the heat off the fact that the medical school is in limbo. But what they won’t mention is that within the last few years they emptied the campus of Psychology and Sociology courses – to the tune of  students. Now they’ve discovered they need numbers back in Derry. But what will be the next to go when our backs are turned  God knows, the priority is to fill Belfast at all costs. They even had the temerity to remove INCORE, an institution developed and rooted in the North West. So don’t ever think anything is sacred – and particularly not the new medical school.   A three-line business case As campaigners we are often challenged by well-meaning supporters and patronising critics to put our money where our mouth is and produce a business case for a new university. And in our previous incarnation we did that, wasting tens of thousands of pounds, and several years, preparing a meticulousproposal that politicians, civil servants and UU blithely ignored in favour of a series of empty promises from each other. Let’s not mince words, the business case is blindingly obvious – and anyone asking for it is really just asking to stall. It can be delivered in just three lines: a The North West has some of the worst social indices on these islands as regards health, education and employment, and our need for HE provision has been established since . b A standalone university of , students, delivering accredited courses from the National University of Ireland’s ten facultiesbefore research earnings are taken into account. On top of this, each student will then spend somewhere between pound and pound to the North West economy per year, bringing in additional annual revenue of between poundm and poundm to the region. c If we don’t move immediately on a standalone university, orwe sit back and expect delivery from UU, Stormont and the NI Civil Service – all of which have failed us and bled our city-region dry for decades – we will inflict decades more of poverty and emigration on the generations to come. We can’t NOT do this. The dficulty is not and has never been, the business case. The dficulty is political will and fear thatwe ‘rock the boat’ we will get nothing. It shows the poverty of ambition in the North West that the election debate in Foyle has been dominated by discussion over who will get credit for a -seat faculty we were first promised almost two decades ago. Every single one of our representatives, political or civil, is too frightened to speak out and demand the wholesale changes we need in case they get blamed for delaying the medical school. It is nothing less than Stockholm Syndrome. It is aswe have talked so long without response about how shockingly discriminatory the situation is, and has always been, that we doubt our own case. Despite that, there is huge support from outside the region from those who can see clearly that the North West’s claim to have its own university is unassailable. Local government in the North West, in partnership with civic society, must take responsibility for the development and scrutiny of all existing and future university development. We cannot allow others, whose interests are not those of the North West, to take the lead. It is reckless of us not to look where for university partners. We are putting the futures of our children at risk. We have American partners, Irish partners and British partners who are interested now in helping us develop a standalone institution. It is time to pull them together and build. We have been led by the nose for too long. Our new MP to be elected this week has a big job ahead of her him. If Derry is to undergo the revival it needs, s he must start by demonstrating the political will to deliver us the new university we deserve. Next week talks will begin to re-establish Stormont. Again, our agenda should be blindingly obvious here. Except, this time, it can be summed up in one line:you want us to have faith in the Belfast institutions, build us a standalone, regional university that puts an end to a century of discrimination respects and reflects our Irish, British and European identity and marks the beginning of a new equal society in northwest Ireland.

Indeed, it is fair to say that our group have been strong supporters of the initiative long before many of the current UU administration ever heard of it. Unfortunately, our city-region has so focused its attentions on this new school – which,UU ever gets its necessary permissions and finance, will have  students by  – that we have completely lost sight of the much bigger picture. Higher Education provision North West is at a catastrophically low level, it has been this way for  years, and our failure to address this crisis is resulting in lasting generational damage. googletag.cmd.push Moreover, the minimal university provision that is located here is controlled and taxed by Belfast and of no economic benefit to our region. Things have gotten so bad that our own Council was recently caught inflating student numbers on a trade mission in a bid to put a gloss on a very bad picture. UU, meanwhile, have spent the past decade playing a bizarre game of push-halfpenny, moving courses in and out of Magee in rapid succession in a bid to create the faccedilade of expansion. But the figures published by the Derry News last month show their manoeuvring to be nothing but a cynical exercise – we had fewer than  full-time university students in  and we still have fewer than  today. googletag.cmd.push And forget any meaningful UU expansion over the next  years. After spending, and borrowing, poundm-plus for the new white elephant campus in North Belfast, there is no money left for Derry. Not a doily. UU will predictably move a few le sciences courses here from Coleraine, for the short-term, to support their case for the medical school. Expect an announcement on this in the New Year to take the heat off the fact that the medical school is in limbo. But what they won’t mention is that within the last few years they emptied the campus of Psychology and Sociology courses – to the tune of  students. Now they’ve discovered they need numbers back in Derry. But what will be the next to go when our backs are turned  God knows, the priority is to fill Belfast at all costs. They even had the temerity to remove INCORE, an institution developed and rooted in the North West. So don’t ever think anything is sacred – and particularly not the new medical school.   A three-line business case As campaigners we are often challenged by well-meaning supporters and patronising critics to put our money where our mouth is and produce a business case for a new university. And in our previous incarnation we did that, wasting tens of thousands of pounds, and several years, preparing a meticulousproposal that politicians, civil servants and UU blithely ignored in favour of a series of empty promises from each other. Let’s not mince words, the business case is blindingly obvious – and anyone asking for it is really just asking to stall. It can be delivered in just three lines: a The North West has some of the worst social indices on these islands as regards health, education and employment, and our need for HE provision has been established since . b A standalone university of , students, delivering accredited courses from the National University of Ireland’s ten facultiesbefore research earnings are taken into account. On top of this, each student will then spend somewhere between pound and pound to the North West economy per year, bringing in additional annual revenue of between poundm and poundm to the region. c If we don’t move immediately on a standalone university, orwe sit back and expect delivery from UU, Stormont and the NI Civil Service – all of which have failed us and bled our city-region dry for decades – we will inflict decades more of poverty and emigration on the generations to come. We can’t NOT do this. The dficulty is not and has never been, the business case. The dficulty is political will and fear thatwe ‘rock the boat’ we will get nothing. It shows the poverty of ambition in the North West that the election debate in Foyle has been dominated by discussion over who will get credit for a -seat faculty we were first promised almost two decades ago. Every single one of our representatives, political or civil, is too frightened to speak out and demand the wholesale changes we need in case they get blamed for delaying the medical school. It is nothing less than Stockholm Syndrome. It is aswe have talked so long without response about how shockingly discriminatory the situation is, and has always been, that we doubt our own case. Despite that, there is huge support from outside the region from those who can see clearly that the North West’s claim to have its own university is unassailable. Local government in the North West, in partnership with civic society, must take responsibility for the development and scrutiny of all existing and future university development.

The Foyle Ambassadors, a group of young environmentalists, completed a clean up on the upstream bank of the River Foyle near Strabane Canal with the help of TV presenter, Derry man Joe Mahon and his production crew who were filming in the area. The young people, and Joe, did a great job with over a dozen bags of rubbish removed. A team of Ulster Bank branch managers completed litter pick on the banks of the River Foyle, close to the mouth of the old Strabane Canal. Local director, Chris McGuiness, said “even though the amount of plastic waste was shocking this was an enjoyable and very worthwhile activity for our team. “We would definitely be interested in doing of this sort of environmental activity in the future.” Finally, a group of volunteers from Seagate took part in bank downstream of Strabane Canal. The volunteers could not believe how much plastic waste had accumulated in such a beautul location. Close to  bags of rubbish were removed. The Loughs Agency’s community engagement officer, Allan Bogle, said afterwards “this is the most rubbish I have seen collected during a volunteer litter pick. It is a great feeling tothis natural area to the way it is supposed to look.”Sharon McMahon, chief executive at the Loughs Agency said ‘rivers are an important habitat for fish and wildle. “Sadly, pollution, including litter and plastic gather in and along the rivers, often in remote places.

Ardmore Folk Group are planning One City One Voice in the hopes that singing together can build strong and lasting peace in Derry.The first Sing for Peace event was held in May after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee when more than , people sang in unison to show that the city is not defined by the violent acts of a small number of iniduals. Dr Nicola Herron, one of the events organisers said: No one really knew what to do after the murder so we organised a sing along and it was really beautul and healing for a lot of people. It brought people back together again and let us get that message across that the people of Derry want peace. Nicola is urging everyone to take part in this weeks event, regardless of singing ability, in the hopes that the singing will be heard far and wide and that it will continue the peace movement during this festive period. The medic says that they have chosen songs that everyone will know to get as many people joining in as possible. Every little voice makes our one big voice stronger, is the message for the event so Nicola is encouraging schools, choirs, youth groups and iniduals to come along on the night. The songs can be found at Christmas Sing for Peace on Facebook and singers are asked to bring their own wordsthey are needed.Violence is a part of our past, not our present - and it certainly wont be a part of our future, and events like these really get that message across, Dr Herron said.The sing-along takes place on Wednesday December , starting in the Guildhall at pm before walking to the Peace Garden on Foyle Street, singing a song on the Peace Bridge and finishing up at the Peace Tree in Ebrington at pm - weather permitting. Anybody taking part is encouraged to wrap up warm and bring LED lights and lanterns with them to light the way. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With his Colchester contract up next summer, Junior is taking his time to work out his next move, especially given his unexpected success at the Brandywell.“Im still on a break but Ive started a little gym programme so Im hoping to be back around the end of December,” he explained. “I definitely needed it. My body was in bits. You know how tough it is in the League of Ireland. Near the end I was struggling with knocks so it was nice to have a break. Ive never had anything like that. Im used to playing a season and having the break in the summer so its weird to find myself not playing at this time of year, but it was needed.”Returning to his parent club as the top scorer in Ireland has given Junior a strong base for negotiations in the coming weeks and months. Whilst reluctant to discuss his future at present, he did admit that he wouldnt rule out ato Derry City.“It helps me in a way but I still have got to go in and work hard and show what I can do and see what happens,” he continued. “I feel good and obviously it has given me a lot of confidence going forward but I still feel good. Im looking to see what happens in the future. “I really enjoyed my time at Derry and the people were great with me, especially the fans, my team mates and the coaching staff, they were all so good to me so I could never rule out Derry. “Its like a second home to me and it was really nice being there. I cant rule it out but Im not sure whats going to happen.” googletag.cmd.push Unknown entityJunior admits that the League of Ireland was an unknown entity to him this time last year but after huge success here, he admitted that he would recommend the league to any English player struggling to get a foothold in the English game.“The way football is played there is very good and positive and I would recommend it to any youngster who is maybe looking to kickstart their career,” he stated. “Maybe the league is a bit dferent here because of the football played, but the League of Ireland is a very good place to go and enjoy your football. “I never knew what to expect,” he insisted. “In my head I just thought it would probably by physical and hard-working.,I didnt expect a lot of teams there to be ball playing or as technical as it was. It was a big surprise but I enjoyed it. “Playing on the wing I learned a lot from that position, not just playing but scoring from that position as well.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
