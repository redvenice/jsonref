And, you know, microplastics are a real problem, especially the microplastics from fast-fashion. Did you know that\u0027s one of the biggest culprits?\u0027Bonnie Sheppard, 15, another Albert Park College student, said: \u0027Meghan was really interested in the effect of microplastics. I told her that there are more microplastics in the ocean than stars in the Milky Way, which she was surprised by.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s amazing what you guys are doing,\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027Well done, you\u0027re doing a really great job.

She\u0027s acting great at the moment,\u0027 Morgan said, adding that it was a \u0027red light when people behave like that, in an odd manner\u0027.Stefanovic hit back at Morgan during Thursday morning\u0027s Today show, saying his comments were \u0027disgraceful\u0027.\u0027I think she is an amazing, amazing woman and I think she\u0027s doing her very best at the moment, and she\u0027s got a lot on her plate and is doing it so beautifully,\u0027 Stefanovic said.\u0027She\u0027s such a great export for Great Britain, I mean - what is that guy on?\u0027Morgan replied to Stefanovic\u0027s outburst on Twitter, telling the Channel Nine presenter to \u0027pipe down\u0027.                                                    Carlo Foster, 12, an Albert Park Primary pupil, showed Harry and Meghan bags full of plastic cups, beakers and bottles he has collected. Harry said: \u0027Another worrying thing I\u0027m hearing is some people trying to claim things like these are actually habitats for fish and turtles. Don\u0027t ever let anyone convince you of that.\u0027The couple also spoke to Melisand Box, 14, from Albert Park College, who had a bag filled with plastic straws. She said: \u0027Harry told us to spread the message about whether people really need to use straws at all, and if they do, to use bamboo or metal straws.\u0027Harry and Meghan then did a \u0027mini-walkabout\u0027, greeting dozens of excited schoolchildren who had lined up on the beach to meet them. Among them was Amelia Marcom, 12, from St Kilda Primary school: \u0027I gave Meghan flowers, a picture of her and Harry I\u0027d drawn for them and some t-shirts for the baby. She said she loved them.\u0027Before leaving the beach, the couple strolled hand in hand down to the shoreline, to meet a group of lifeguards from Australia Surf Lifeguards. Sebastian Top, 20, a lifeguard for more than four years, asked Meghan, \u0027Are you going to swim today?\u0027 \u0027Maybe not today,\u0027 she laughed. Harry pointed to a group of around 30 people who had waded into the sea from the beach to get a better view of them: \u0027If we try and swim, I think they might be a bit of a hazard.\u0027 Showing they\u0027re not afraid to get their hands dirty, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will help local schoolchildren pick up litter from South Melbourne beach.Changing into a pair of  Rothy\u0027s flats and a matching black Miguellina Dress, Meghan and her husband made their way onto Melbourne\u0027s iconic mode of transport, along with student leaders at a local school. Arriving at the beach, the couple were fortunate to be greeted not only by roaring crowds, but also a bit of sunshine. Earlier, despite the royal couple arriving 20 minutes late for their first engagement of the day, the crowd of around 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm, gripped by \u0027Meg-Mania\u0027.           Harry and Meghan wave to the well-wishers after taking a ride on a tram in Melbourne          On the way to the beach Meghan smiled and showed Harry a little stuffed toy as the rode the tram in Melbourne          The couple took Melbourne\u0027s iconic tram system to the beach, catching it with student leaders at a local school          After lunch, the Duke and Duchess made a quick wardrobe change, the latter changing from heels to flats          Prince Harry also changed from the navy suit which originally matched his wife\u0027s outfit into a grey jacket and black trousers          The couple were also treated to lunch at Fitzroy\u0027s Charcoal Lane, which offers Aboriginal youths employment          Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of eucalyptus, the chef encouraged the royal visitors to smell it. \u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.          Among other plants, Harry bites into some eucalyptus, but not before he had to ask: \u0027Isn\u0027t that what koalas eat?\u0027    Executive Chef Greg Hampton (right) told the royal couple how they provide opportunity to young Aboriginal people  Harry tried plants and was also served Kangaroo and barracuda as a series of Aussie delicacies were prepared and Meghan had a good sniff of some ingredients          The couple departed Government House, visiting an Aboriginal artwork mural on Fitzroy restaurant Charcoal Lane    Prince Harry has cheekily mocked a young girl (pictured) who put a hand on her hips and refused to take a photograph with the royalPrince Harry has cheekily mocked a camera-shy young girl who refused to pose for a photograph with the visiting royal.While thousands of fans have clamoured for a piece of the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle, this toddler in Dubbo had other ideas.She placed her left hand on her hip and stubbornly refused to move forward and say hello to a bemused prince.He in turn placed his hands on his hips to playfully mimic the young girl before bending down to give her a hug.The girl\u0027s parents were heard in the background giggling at their daughter\u0027s behaviour during the meet-and-greet in Dubbo on Wednesday before pushing her slightly forward to chat to the prince.                                                     But Meghan and Harry appeared completely at ease as they took a tram to the beach with a group of excited schoolchildren.While the journey lasted less than five minutes, the youngsters managed to get in some pressing questions. Ella Burns, a 12-year-old pupil from Albert Park primary school added: \u0027She said that she hadn\u0027t thought of one as it was still quite early.\u0027Meghan was also asked by Ella what she liked doing in her spare time.The Duchess replied that she \u0027didn\u0027t have much spare time\u0027 but when she does, she enjoys \u0027relaxing and watching TV shows.\u0027She faltered when asked what her favourite show was, and replied: \u0027There\u0027s heaps, I can\u0027t think of a specific one.\u0027 Meanwhile Lola Marinis, 12, from Middlepark Primary School, sat near Harry.He asked what job she wanted to do, and she replied that she wanted to be a teacher.Harry told her, \u0027There is always going to be one bad teacher that you remember, we need more good teachers.\u0027The Duchess of Sussex has been given plenty of flowers since she arrived in Australia. But today she was given her first tiara.It was presented by six year old Annie, a pupil at Albert Park primary school in Melbourne.Annie was one of 600 cheering children who greeted the duke and duchess as they came to see how the school is cutting waste and growing vegetables as part of a sustainability programme.Harry spotted Annie, who was holding a bunch of flowers as well as a toy tiara, and knelt down and said: \u0027Lily of the valley - is that right?\u0027Then, gesturing to Meghan, he said: \u0027Are they for her?\u0027The duchess, who was wearing a dress by Club Monaco, came over and said: \u0027Oh my goodness, thank you. Those are amazing!\u0027The couple met the school\u0027s \u0027waste warriors\u0027, dressed up in cape and masks, and met some sustainability leaders who showed them their \u0027nude food\u0027 lunch boxes, without any plastic wrapping.At the school wormery the duke was invited to name their pet snail. \u0027Speedy?\u0027 he suggested.At the vegetable patch, which included marigolds, peas, lettuce and alfalfa, Emma Cafferkey and Finn McClenaghan, both 12, showed them how to mulch. \u0027The mulch is made out of sugar that has been shredded. You have to remember with the mulch not to put it on top of the plants.\u0027After they left he said: \u0027They said we were very well educated and that we knew a lot about this kind of stuff.\u0027As they left, one little boy told Harry: \u0027You remind me of my uncle.\u0027The duke replied: \u0027Is that a good thing? Is it because I\u0027ve got a ginger beard?\u0027           Meghan and Harru spent time in the gardens of Govrenment House today where they met dignitaries and even an Aussie Rules star          The the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are a tactile couple and were often seen holding hands or giving eachothr a supportive rub this time at the Royal Botanic Gardens  Harry and Meghan having fun as they visit projects that align with their goals on the tour including encouraging women to take part in sport          The Duchess concentrated as she passes an Australian Rules football during an event at Government House          Meghan has said she is \u0027tired\u0027 but having a fantastic time on their 16-day tour with 76 different functions in four different countriesFoodie Meghan was in her element as she and Harry enjoyed a taste of Australia at Charcoal Lane, a social enterprise restaurant in Melbourne\u0027s trendy Fitzroy suburb.At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi.          Meghan laughed a great deal during a reception where they met young ambassadors in Victoria and played games with themIt was prepared by young chefs being trained by the Mission Australia programme, which assists young indigenous Australians into employment, in many cases giving them a fresh start in life.Before the meal, they visited the kitchen, where Executive Chef Greg Hampton told the Duke and Duchess: \u0027Welcome, we are so happy to have you here.\u0027Gesturing at the sparkling surfaces, Harry said: \u0027You\u0027ve got a very clean kitchen – is it always this clean? Especially clean today?\u0027Meghan slipped off her Martin Grant trench coat in the warm room before Greg talked the couple through an array of unusual herbs and aromatic spices, getting them to smell and taste them.\u0027A lot of these ingredients have been here for thousands of years. Our fruits are the same as fruits thousands of years ago,\u0027 he explained.Showing them a finger lime, he squeezed out the fleshy contents, explaining: \u0027It comes out like caviar.\u0027\u0027Oh my goodness, that\u0027s incredible,\u0027 said the Duchess.But he warned the couple that the Tasmanian Pepper came with a kick, adding: \u0027I don\u0027t want to freak you out!\u0027Speaking ahead of their arrival, he had said: \u0027I would hesitate to offer her (the pregnant Duchess) the pepper, because they are quite hot.\u0027The first time I tasted one I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the heat creeps up on you. I don\u0027t want to freak her out.\u0027Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of Eucalyptus, he encouraged the royal visitors to smell it.\u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.\u0027Yes, but we can\u0027t eat it in the same way,\u0027 replied Greg, explaining how oils from the plant are used to flavour marinades, fish dishes and even ice cream.The couple were presented with Charcoal Lane aprons for the \u0027touch, taste and smell\u0027 experience, but did not wear them.Speaking ahead of the royal visit, Greg said: \u0027We are here to support young Aboriginal people into the workforce, with a view that when they leave this place, there is going to be long-term employment for them,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m not going to turn everyone that comes here into a chef, but if they leave here with a work ethic, it\u0027s a win for us.\u0027           Governor of Victoria Linda Dessau and her husband Anthony Howard at a reception given by the Governor of Victoria, at Government House during their visit to Melbourne          The expressive couple smile and laughed throughout the day today as they were mobbed by supporters wishing them well          The crowd of about 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm for the pair, despite being slightly behind schedule          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrived          Harry tenderly holds his wife\u0027s hand behind his back as they enter Government House in Melbourne today    Harry and Meghan went Government House, where they were greeted by Governor Linda Dessau          At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi          Meghan looks adoringly at her husband at a reception held in their honour today as their tour hit day 3           The Duke and Duchess of Sussex raced model Formula 1 cars inside Government House, meeting with young leaders          Duchess Meghan was seen patting a guide dog in the reception of Government HouseCharcoal Lane currently employs 23 young people for 15 hours a week as they work towards a Certificate 2 in hospitality.\u0027A lot of them come from backgrounds where nobody has worked, so this is very important for them,\u0027 said Greg.Programme Manager Troy Crellin said that in 10 years, the organisation had helped some 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders into work.The Duke and Duchess\u0027s visit to the restaurant began after they admired a mural outside created by Gunnai and Waradgerie man Robert Young to honour the building and the area\u0027s indigenous heritage.He told Harry and Meghan how his Celebration Dreaming artwork references Aboriginal identity, connections and culture in inner Melbourne Fitzroy.Before heading into the kitchen, they received a Welcome to Country delivered by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Colin Hunter.Mission Australia CEO, James Toomey said: \u0027It was such a fantastic and humbling surprise to hear that Mission Australia\u0027s restaurant, Charcoal Lane was chosen to welcome The Duke and Duchess for a tour, hands-on cooking session and lunch. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the students to meet Their Royal Highnesses. Not too many young people can say they\u0027ve met and served royalty\u0027.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were introduced to some of Melrbourne\u0027s brightest and most innovative young people at a reception hosted by the Governor of Victoria, their first event of the day.The couple arrived at Government House for a Young Victorians Leaders reception approximately 25 minutes late after being stuck in traffic earlier that morning. But Harry and Meghan got straight to work when they were greeted by the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, and her husband Anthony QC, who took them inside for a private meeting.Ten minutes later the couple re-emerged and were escorted across Government House\u0027s West where they were able to see a display put on by Victoria\u0027s This Girl Can empowerment campaign, which encourages everyday women to get active however, wherever and whenever they want without being judged.The couple were presented with a display of 150 women showcasing a number of activities, including netball, yoga, boxercise, cricket, cycling and Zumba.Meghan appeared to enjoy the fitness display, which was accompanied by high-energy soundtrack by DJ Yo Mafia, and was even convinced to throw an Australian Football League gameball. \u0027I\u0027m not sure I will be good,\u0027 she nervously laughed as she delicately threw the ball to one of the women. \u0027I\u0027m not sure I did it right!\u0027Jerril Rechter, CEO of VicHealth who showed the duchess around the event, said: \u0027She was really impressed by the ersity of activity we had here today, and especially the sense of camaraderie between the women.\u0027She did pass an AFL football. She did a handball. That\u0027s a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do.\u0027She had not seen an AFL football before Howard, the governor\u0027s husband, explained to her what it was like - the weight of it is a little bit different, and that you handball it, you don\u0027t pass it.\u0027Sabrin Nyawela, 20, a student teacher and This Girl Can ambassador originally from South Sudan, also spoke to the duchess.\u0027She was talking about how she loved the whole vibe of This Girl Can. She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged.

She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged. She has done a lot of work in the background with women\u0027s empowerment and it was good to see her coming along and seeing people in local communities making a change.\u0027After walking around the presentation, the couple - who had spit up to view different areas of the display - reunited to walk inside Government House to meet young people involved in a number of innovative and entrepreneurial programmes developed by young people in the Victoria region.First up was the Man Cave - a preventative mental health program for teenage boys, which was founded by Queens Young Leader Hunter Johnson.\u0027There\u0027s a familiar face,\u0027 Meghan said as she reached out to shake the CEO\u0027s hand. Harry also made a beeline to greet Johnson, who quickly thanked the Duke for his support.The conversation quickly turned to Harry\u0027s speech in Dubbo on Wednesday, where he delivered an emotional message to Australian farmers and opened up about depression and mental health issues.\u0027So many young much are suffering from these problems without even realising,\u0027 Harry remarked.Also representing Man Cave was 14-year-old Rupert Grant, a student from Melbourne Grammar School who had been involved with the programme through his school after experiencing a \u0027tough time\u0027 in school. After explaining how the programme had made an impact on life for him and his friends, Meghan remarked, \u0027You\u0027re quite the spokesman!\u0027          Prince Harry and Meghan started model Formula 1 cars at demonstration held at Government House in Melbourne          Harry and Meghan have now arrived at Government House, where they were greeted by Victorian Governor Linda Dessau\u0027We really need more global leaders like Harry,\u0027 Johnson later shared. \u0027There is a change happening among men now, a focus on healthy masculinity and having his support is a real badge of honour.\u0027I thanked Harry for his role modelling and leadership - and we spoke about his incredible words in Dubbo. When I said that the Duchess looked up him proudly.\u0027It\u0027s important that as men we address these issues, that we\u0027re not afraid to take the mask off and open up. To have started that conversation in Dubbo yesterday was powerful.\u0027He\u0027s a positive, glass half-full person and has an incredible influence on the younger generation. He is the right role model for young men and boys today.\u0027After meeting the team from Man Cave, the Duke and Duchess moved on to learn more about Aubot, a robot that can help hospitalised children continue to attend school and the disabled attend work.\u0027This is amazing,\u0027 Meghan commented as she waved a hand in front of one of the robots named after its founder and CEO Marita Chang.Harry seemed particularly interested in their next presentation - a vertical, edible \u0027farm\u0027 designed to grow inside Melbourne cafes, restaurants and, one day, people\u0027s homes. \u0027It will be interesting to see one day how this challenges the supermarkets if people are growing these in their homes,\u0027 Prince Harry said of Farmwall, which was co-founded by Melbourne-based Geert Hendrix.\u0027But I hope that these can be produced with farmers in mind too, so they can exist side by side.\u0027Added Meghan, \u0027I like that there is a focus on nutrients. I can see you have the sprouts, the micro greens... It\u0027s very clever.\u0027          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrive          Recently announced pregnant, Meghan removed her coat as the couple approached the steps of Government HouseThe couple\u0027s final presentation was by the team of Trinity Grammar School, who were part of the Formula 1 in Schools programme - an international STEM competition for schools in which students design and manufacture a miniature car out of an official F1 Model Block.Upon seeing the miniature F1 drag strip the students had built on the State Dining Room table, Harry joked, \u0027We should put one in Buckingham Palace.\u0027They were then offered to launch the two F1 race car models, however neither were expecting the loud air release from the hydraulics that launched the cars. \u0027I wasn\u0027t expecting that!\u0027 exclaimed Meghan, who jumped at the loud noise. Harry laughed.Following the innovation program displays, the Duke and Duchess were escorted by the Governor and her husband to the main reception in the Government House Ballroom, where approximately 350 young people representing the future of Victoria were gathered. The guests were from a broad range of backgrounds, including students, military personnel, entrepreneurs, charity volunteers and farmers.\u0027You are the future of our state - brilliant, innovative and inspiring,\u0027 Governor Dessau said in a welcome speech before the royal couple split up to socialise with the guests who had been grouped together.One of the first Meghan got to meet was Willow the golden Labrador, who was representing Guide Dogs Victoria. \u0027Ahh, everyone knows my achilles heel is dogs,\u0027 she cooed, before kneeling down to pet the \u0027ambassadog\u0027.

The Duchess is a big role model to many.\u0027Harry, who had been working the opposite side of the room - meeting military personnel and volunteers at the Victoria Police force amongst many others - rejoined his wife to move to the final part of their visit in a formal reception space at Government House.

Physical activity like yoga and surfing is so good for healing your mind.\u0027 As a TV star based in Toronto presiding over her own lifestyle website, The Tig, then actress Meghan frequently updated her fans on her favourite workouts - revealing she was a fan of Pilates Platinum, the megaformer method founded by her close friend, pilates instructor Heather Dorak. Her remarks today made clear she intends to keep working out through pregnancy. Kensington Palace confirmed the Duke and Duchess\u0027 happy news in a statement on Monday, just hours after they touched down in Australia at the start of their first major overseas tour.The popular couple have been greeted by cheering crowds at all of their engagements to date, including a trip to Bondi Beach on Friday morning where Harry and Meghan joined a circle of colourfully dressed surfers to discuss the importance of being open about mental health battles.  The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own, laughing and putting their arms around each other.           The royal couple visited Macarthur High School on the afternoon of the fourth day of their Australian tour          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle spoke to the high school students about striving for female empowerment          The royals\u0027 attendance to the school was the worst kept secret in town, with students anxiously awaiting their arrival          They were shown student projects, including one where students made boxes of supplies to donate to vulnerable women          Meghan was sympathetic when a student told her about their part-time job, reminiscing on her own first job          The Duke and Duchess were introduced to teenage boys and girls from the In League In Harmony project from the NRL          \u0027All these people you know of in your neighbourhood, now you know them and you\u0027re united,\u0027 the Duchess told studentsThey also visited Macarthur Girls High School on the fourth day of their visit to Australia and spoke to teenagers about equality, with the Duchess - who has even put her \u0027feminist manifesto\u0027 on the Buckingham Palace website - saying she felt \u0027emotional\u0027 hearing their passionate views.Harry, who is now said to identify as a feminist, told the girls he wants men to add their voices to the fight for equality. \u0027Men can help as well by getting involved, we have to,\u0027 he said. \u0027We need to get men\u0027s voices involved as soon as possible.\u0027 His wife, who has been a long-term advocate for women\u0027s rights, told students that their projects, including making boxes of supplies for women in need, made her proud.\u0027You guys all remind me so much of myself when I was growing up,\u0027 she told 14-year-old girls. \u0027I went to an all girls school which was incredibly erse as well. \u0027I think being around such empowered young women, it becomes something that you all just grasp onto to understand your world. \u0027It\u0027s made you confident, well-spoken. You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up. \u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 The couple\u0027s \u0027surprise\u0027 appearance at the school on Friday turned out to be the worst-kept secret on campus.As Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, teased them about being overexcited to see her, the teenagers fizzed with anticipation until the Duke and Duchess were finally introduced. Then, cheers and excited screams filled the air as they walked outside to meet the well-behaved girls, who had been sitting neatly for assembly. Invited to sit on a park bench in the centre, the couple watched a ballet-inspired dance performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027 before heading inside for the workshops.           The program aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027          Invited to sit on a park bench, the couple watched a ballet-inspired performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027The couple earlier went to Bondi Beach, one of Australia\u0027s most famous landmarks, to meet a local community surfing group known as One Wave.It was founded by Grant Trebilco who suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them.He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.When he came out, he said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He has now created \u0027Fluro Fridays\u0027 where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Harry and Meghan, who was wearing a sleeveless Martin Grant dress with espadrille tie wedges, were both given brightly-coloured \u0027leis\u0027 - garlands of flowers - to put round their necks in order to enter into the spirit of things.Accompanied by Trebilco, they kicked off their shoes on the edge of the beach and walked barefoot to sit in a group with some of the colourfully-dressed surfers.          Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for help    The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.          One member of the circle said he could \u0027see the passion\u0027 for awareness of mental health in the couples\u0027 eyes          Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go          The royal couple pictured with garlands of flowers, or \u0027leis\u0027, dangling around their necks as they walk through the sand          Thousands of well-wishers came out to Sydney\u0027s iconic Bondi Beach to see the royal couple on Friday morningStuart Klees, 34, of Bondi, said: \u0027Harry shared his views on mental health towards everyone.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in normalising the conversation around mental health.\u0027He feels fortunate that he\u0027s in a position to get the right people together to spread that message.\u0027He\u0027s a big supporter of small community groups like One Wave.\u0027Prince Harry talked to the group about his own issues with mental health.\u0027He said he\u0027s seen a couple of counsellors before and never found one that suits him,\u0027 Klees said.\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in having normal conversations with normal people.\u0027He was pretty genuine, real honest, real open, real relaxed.\u0027He wasn\u0027t trying to put on a show. He was really genuine in the way he came across.\u0027As she left, Meghan told the group that she was \u0027loving\u0027 her first experience of Australia. \u0027It is so great to be here,\u0027 she said."},{"url":null,"title":"Karlie Kloss Joshua Kushner married","story":"Say \u0026#39I do\u0026#39 in a beautiful Dior wedding dress like KarlieGet the look belowSupermodel Karlie Kloss revealed on Instagram that she\u0026#39s tied the knot with her beau Joshua Kushner!The beautiful bride chose a stunning wedding gown by Dior, featuring a fitted bodice with long-sleeved lace overlay and a full skirt.

I love the smoky, sophisticated atmosphere of the image. This feels very right for now — escapist and sensual... You can start a whole script just by staring into her eyes.\u0027Their collaboration didn\u0027t stop there, and Kloss remained Galliano\u0027s muse until he was fired in 2011 following an anti-Semitic rant that was caught on tape Kloss has also said that a Dior bag gifted to her by Galliano is her dearest possession.\u0027He gave it to me after we shot my first campaign with Steven Meisel, and I cried when I opened it. It is the most beautiful, timeless Dior bag. It is such a special reminder of that time in my career someday I will give it to my daughter,\u0027 she told Vogue in 2012.The two have not worked together of recent, and it was the house’s current designer who made the dress Kloss wore in perhaps her last piece for the brand.Maria Grazia Churi announced earlier this year that she will leave Dior, where she became creative director two years ago after a successful stint at Valentino. Kloss took her mom with her to Paris for the final fitting of that dress, which occured during fashion week.           Family: Joshua, who is a \u0027lifelong Democrat,\u0027 is the younger brother of White House senior adviser Jared Kusnher, who is married to first daughter Ivanka Trump (pictured in 2013)          Siblings-in-law: Karlie and Joshua have not made a public appearance together with Jared and Ivanka.

on Jeremy KyleKloss has a close relationship with the entire Kushner family, despite the fact that her and her new husband do not share the same political views as Ivanka and Jared.And Kloss, like Ivanka, is reported to have converted to Judaism ahead of the ceremony.Ivanka is particularly close with Josh as he manages her trust while she works for her father in the White House.That trust, which was revealed to be worth approximately $50million in White House documents released last year, is controlled by not only Josh but also Ivanka’s sister-in-law Nicole Meyer. Jared\u0027s brother Josh and sister Nicole may in fact be family, and as a result more accessible to Ivanka, but there is no question that the two were a logical choice to manage a trust.Josh is the owner of the venture capital firm Thrive, who were one of the first to invest in Instagram.He attended undergrad at Harvard, like his brother Jared, and stayed in Cambridge to attend business school at the Ivy League university as well, graduating in 2011.The real estate scion, who was raised in New Jersey, took a job at Goldman Sachs after school before heading off on his own with Thrive.Thrive closed its fifth fund in 2016 for $700 million, pushing the total amount managed by the group at the time to approximately $1.3 billion.He is also the co-founder of Oscar Health and was a Hillary Clinton supporter in the election.Nicole is a principal at Kushner properties (as is Josh) and her husband Joseph is the chief executive of Observer Media.There is a fourth Kushner sibling, Dara, who lives with her family in New Jersey near the home where she grew up with her brother Jared."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/19/07/5170C1C000000578-6293371-image-a-90_1539932289944.jpg","title":"Prince

short sleeved black shirt as he made quick pace up the bridge, swapping his position between up to a dozen others to chat to different climbing companions.However, he decided to forgo the goofy bright blue jumpsuit thousands of tourists have been photographed wearing as they smile at the arch’s summit.As luck would have it, the morning clouds and fog cleared up by the time he began his ascent about 3pm, treating him to an unblemished view as a flag advertising the Invictus Games flew next to the Australian flag.Sexual assault gang served with jail sentencesTeenager was disowned by his mother for

It\u0027s made you confident, well-spoken. You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up.\u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t stop,\u0027 the Prince reiterated. \u0027Get more people involved, guys as well.\u0027 Teachers explained that the girls have been taking an \u0027integrated course\u0027 on top of their usual studies, to give them \u002721st century capabilities\u0027 including creativity and critical thinking, with \u0027a core focus on making a change in local communities\u0027. One project saw them make boxes of supplies to donate to vulnerable women via police stations and refuge centres, while in another they created notebooks to pass forward for students to write about the women who have inspired them. Coincidentally, one pupil had written about the Duchess long before the royal visit had been announced. Tahlia Ohenhen, 15, told the Duke and Duchess how another group had created picture books to teach younger children about poverty and encourage them to treat those less fortunate with kindness and empathy.The couple nodded as Tahlia added: \u0027The younger you get your children educated on things like this, the easier it is for them to grow up and be aware of it and make a difference.\u0027 \u0027Kindness and empathy lacks big time in the world,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027It\u0027s so great you are passionate about all of this. \u0027You realise this is the generation that\u0027s going to make all the difference?\u0027           Teachers explained that the girls have been taking an \u0027integrated course\u0027 on top of their usual studies, to give them \u002721st century capabilities\u0027 including creativity and critical thinking          The Duchess of Sussex told students how her upbringing at an all-girls school and her first job \u0027taking out the trash\u0027 has made her \u0027the person she is today\u0027          The royals look on during their surprise visit to the school in Sydney\u0027s west on Friday.

It give you a good work ethic, right?\u0027 She joined groups of students from across different schools in Sydney who have been introduced via the programme, which teaches them: \u0027Everybody belongs.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s so important,\u0027 said the Duchess. \u0027All these people you know of in your neighbourhood, now you know them and you\u0027re united. You\u0027re proud of where you\u0027re from, you can champion where you\u0027re from and make people see it for what it is.\u0027 Harry, sitting with a second group of youngsters, joked that he was \u0027clinging onto my youth at the age of 34,\u0027 said he now looked to the younger generation for inspiration. \u0027We\u0027re so lucky that wherever we go in the world, we\u0027re finding young people like you guys,\u0027 he said. \u0027This sweeping wave of kindness and optimism and empathy that\u0027s seems to be lacking in some of the previous generation.

She said flattery and criticism run through the same filter.\u0027She said it was very freeing that she no longer has social media.\u0027And just how great One Wave is making those connections with people and being able to support one another.\u0027Harry and Meghan¿s great Aussie day out!

Harry talked about how everyone has their different recipe and how much sports can help with your mental health.\u0027He said he and Meghan had surfed before. We tried to get him in and told him we had a wet suit and surf board ready for him, but he said he couldn\u0027t. They were so engaging, they had time for everyone and really felt part of the One Wave community.\u0027 Mr Trebilco suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them. He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.He said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He then created Fluro Fridays - where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Sexual assault gang served with jail sentencesTeenager was disowned by his mother for giant facial tumourHarry and Meghan bond with their fans on Sydney\u0027s Bondi BeachSHOCKING moment pensioner is viciously attacked in BirminghamMoment backpacker sprays \u0027Scouse Lee\u0027 on 800-year-old Thai fortressBaffled girlfriend gets answer to riddle wrong THREE timesCCTV footage shows kidnapping of Hannah Cornelius and friendMoment youth pulls knife in South London street altercationCar seen departing as preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prisonAnjem Choudary poses for cameras after prison releaseBungling airport worker destroys \u0026quotvery pricey\u0026quot engine of a Boeing 747Jermaine Pennant jokes about lie detector test on Jeremy Kyle    The royal couple also met and shared jokes with local lifeguards (left), made famous by television series Bondi Rescue          Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan are pictured meeting a young child during their Bondi Beach visit on Friday  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on their official 16-day Autumn tour visiting cities in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand          Meghan is seen preparing to take part in OneWave\u0027s mental health awareness session on the sand at the world-famous beach          Meghan is seen laughing as she mingled with locals on Friday morning.

It\u0027s a sign of strength. Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health. It reduces that barrier.

He is not some sort of evil genius we all need to be afraid of.\u0027We have to recognise that radicalisers look to generate a profile, they look to prey on the vulnerable.\u0027We need to be thoughtful about how we report their activity.\u0027                                                    The hate preacher branded the most dangerous man in Britain will live at the property under the strictest conditions ever imposed on a released prisoner.The hate preacher will remain at the hostel after serving half his five year and a half year sentence for pledging allegiance to ISIS.One trader, who asked not to be named, said: \u0027It is sickening knowing he is so close.\u0027They should find another place for him away from the community. Everyone has heard of him. If he hates this country so much he should be deported.\u0027Another trader setting up a stall selling T-shirts and items for tourists, added: \u0027I know people are meant to get a second chance - but not for this man. He\u0027s done too much damage\u0027. The Government has launched a campaign to debunk his influence and ridicule with Whitehall sources calling him a \u0027shameless coward\u0027 who was \u0027too scared\u0027 to go to war himself so encouraged vulnerable young men to go instead.The insider told the Telegraph: \u0027Choudary is just a coward. He has never travelled anywhere to fight and yet has been happy to see followers go abroad to wage jihad and die. \u0027He doesn\u0027t care about them. He is happy to radicalise vulnerable young men and send them to fight. But he is too scared to go. He is no martyr\u0027.           Neighbours are irate that Choudary is living next door to a primary in his bail hostel Choudary was to a probation hostel after serving half his sentence for swearing an oath of allegiance to Islamic State – despite security experts warning the \u0027Pied Piper of jihad\u0027 would inspire more terror attacks.However, he will be subject to a huge security operation, including surveillance teams, monitoring devices and demands that he adhere to up to 25 rules controlling his activities.          Anjem Choudary has been released from prison after serving just half his five-and-a-half year sentenceChoudary, 51, a married father of five, is one of Britain\u0027s most notorious firebrand clerics. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years for inviting support for ISIS, but was given automatic release after serving half his sentence. The judge who sent him to prison in 2016, Mr Justice Holroyde, said he would be dangerous in jail and on release.He told him at the Old Bailey: \u0027You show no remorse at all for anything you have said or done and I have no doubt you will continue to communicate your message whenever you can\u0027. His unpopular  release came as:■Campaigners said he remained \u0027Britain\u0027s most dangerous extremist\u0027 after research showed he is already linked to over 120 Islamist terrorists.■It was revealed that the huge security surrounding him is estimated to cost the taxpayer more than £2million a year - compared to the £50,000 to keep him in jail.■An imam who has met Choudary in jail suggested he had used human rights laws to be placed in a half-way house in North London – close to where he used to preach – by claiming he had to be near his children.The release is a landmark moment for the Government, which is still reeling from a string of atrocities which left more than 30 dead last year.          Hate preacher Anjem Choudary pictured in the 1990s as a student drinking with friends who are reading Mayfair magazineThe preacher, who once led banned group Al-Muhajiroun, was sentenced in 2016. Fiyaz Mughal, head of anti-extremist group Faith Matters, has spoken to the imam who was brought into jail to try to de-radicalise him.\u0027Choudary was put in containment that stops him engaging with other prisoners, but also given pastoral care to see if they could get through to him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I asked the guy who spoke to him if the de-radicalisation programme had worked and he said, \u0027No, he\u0027s got worse. He\u0027s hardened\u0027. He speaks in the mind-set of the victim. He sees himself as a martyr the state tried to silence.\u0027Choudary does not plan to directly challenge the conditions of his release, but instead is working out ways to get round them, Mr Mughal said.\u0027He\u0027s said things like, \u0027if someone wants to upload my videos I\u0027m not going to stop them\u0027.\u0027Mr Mughal added: \u0027He should have served the full term. It\u0027s a terrible day for victims of the attacks he has helped incite.\u0027We need a change in the law so that anyone named as the inciter in two terrorist attacks should automatically serve the full sentence.\u0027Dr Michael Kenney, of the University of Pittsburgh, who followed Al-Muhajiroun for five years for his research, said its followers were \u0027very excited\u0027 about his release.They had been dormant following his arrest, but are now expected to try to \u0027rebuild and revitalise\u0027, he said.And he warned it was \u0027entirely possible\u0027 that more of his followers would turn to terrorism, like Khuram Butt, who was part of last year\u0027s London Bridge terror attack and Lee Rigby killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.Security expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said: \u0027He is charismatic and a very gifted orator – he is the Pied Piper of Jihad.\u0027Those who are vulnerable to his warped messages will see him as a hero … who has been through the fire of imprisonment.\u0027Security sources say Choudary\u0027s conviction has raised his credibility among fanatics. In the past, his desire not to go to prison and, what was seen in some quarters as his cowardice by not going to Syria, raised suspicions that he was a stooge for the security services.      Hate preacher Anjem Choudary - who inspired some of Britain\u0027s most notorious terrorists - is to be released on Friday and moved to a bail hostel Campaign group Hope not Hate found he has been directly or indirectly linked to at least 123 Islamist terrorists.\u0027Anjem Choudary will remain the most dangerous extremist in Britain today,\u0027 said Nick Lowles, chief executive. \u0027This is a man who has inspired dozens to commit acts of violence.\u0027The security operation will include surveillance teams, monitoring devices and demands that Choudary adhere to up to 25 rules. He also faces being targeted by UN sanctions to freeze his assets, prevent him travelling and even enforce \u0027arms embargo provisions\u0027.Theresa May yesterday insisted safeguards were place to protect people from him.  Web of hate: How Anjem Choudary\u0027s sermons inspired a generation of home-grown terrorists and radicals The hate-filled circle around Anjem Choudary was a breeding ground for the Islamic extremism which plagued Britain in the last two decades.Former law-student Choudary, who previously called for adulterers to be stoned to death and branded UK troops \u0027cowards\u0027, always hid behind free speech rules whenever challenged by the authorities.But the group he helped to set up were linked to a series of terrorist attacks, as easily-influenced young men became inspired by his twisted vision of jihad.The best known of his disciples was Muslim convert Michael Adebolajo, who, along with Michael Adebowale, attacked Fusilier Lee Rigby with a meat cleaver in Woolwich in 2013 in a murder which shocked the country.            Anjem Choudary was at the centre of a web of extremists who operated in LondonAdebolajo was a supporter of Choudary\u0027s al-Muhajiroun group and was pictured standing behind the hate preacher in 2007.After the incident, Choudary said Adebolajo was \u0027a practising Muslim and a family man\u0027 who he was \u0027proud of\u0027.But he denied encouraging the killer to carry out the attack, insisting he was \u0027channeling the energy of the youth through demonstrations and processions\u0027.London Bridge attacker Khuram Butt  also joined one of Choudary\u0027s rallies, this time on College Green outside the Palace of Westminster in 2013.There, Butt \u0027verbally assaulted\u0027 a moderate Muslim leader who had opposed Choudary\u0027s extremist rhetoric.Meanwhile, Mohammed Reza Haque, thought of as Choudary\u0027s bodyguard, disappeared from Britain in 2014.  London Bridge attacker Kharum Butt (left) and Westminster attacker Khalid Masood (right)A photograph taken in Syria showed him in a balaclava and camouflage clothing, brandishing an AK-47 assault rifle and he has since been suspected as being a tall figure in ISIS\u0027s horrific execution films.Siddhartha Dhar, who once ran Choudary\u0027s media operation, was also seen posing in a military style coat and boots, brandishing an assault rifle and holding his new born baby in Syria, labelling the picture \u0027Generation Khilafah\u0027.In December 2014, two other close associates were discovered in the back of a lorry at Dover as they tried to leave the country.Westminster attacker Khalid Masood was also linked to Choudary through Ibrahim Anderson, an al-Muhajiroun activist  convicted of inviting support for ISIS in 2016.  Will this fanatic branded despicable by fellow Muslims spark a new terror wave, asks NEIL TWEEDIEHe laughs boorishly for the camera across a pub table crammed with half-drained pint glasses and cans of cider, while a friend sitting next to him flaunts a copy of a soft-porn magazine. As a young man – a failed medical student turned aspiring lawyer – Anjem Choudary liked porn, casual sex, booze and getting stoned.Now, at the age of 51, he prefers others to get stoned – but not on drugs. ‘For people who have had adultery committed against them, people who have had their wives taken, a lot will say: “I think stoning to death is appropriate”,’ he has said.Welcome to the warped, medieval world of Britain’s most virulent Islamist hate-preacher who, following his expected release from prison today, is back in circulation – albeit hemmed in by draconian restrictions on his freedom.Choudary, who was raised in Kent by Pakistani immigrant parents, is a man consumed with hatred for the liberal society that nurtured him, and a believer in the unforgiving rule of sharia law. In his universe, for every human weakness there is a brutally appropriate punishment, including crucifixion, and for every infidel a place in hellfire.            Hate preacher Anjem Choudary - who inspired some of Britain\u0027s most notorious terrorists - is to be released on Friday and moved to a bail hostel including Michael Adebolajo (left) who beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013This so-called cleric, who is not a recognised religious scholar, has inspired some of Britain’s most infamous Islamist terrorists, including Khuram Butt, leader of the London Bridge attacks in June last year, and Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby who was hacked to death in Woolwich in 2013.It is thought that more than 100 terrorists owe him some degree of allegiance, and many more acolytes have made their way to Syria to take part in jihad. Choudary, a qualified solicitor who used his skills to stay just the right side of the law during two decades of extolling extremism, was brought to justice after being caught expressing support for the banned terrorist sect Islamic State.Jailed for five and a half years at the Old Bailey in August 2016, he is now free on licence after serving half his sentence – to the frustration of those who understand the danger he represents.‘I would describe him as a hardened terrorist, somebody who has had huge influence on the Islamist extremist scene in this country over many years,’ says Richard Walton, a former head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. ‘I believe we are under-estimating the potency and danger of the radicalisers who don’t carry knives, guns and overtly plot terrorist attacks but who pollute the minds of young Muslim men.’During a debate in the House of Lords on the Government’s proposed counter-terrorism and border security Bill this month, Lord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said a quarter of jihadis convicted in Britain between 2001 and 2015 were ‘associated’ with Choudary, compared with a tenth linked to al-Qaeda and one in 20 connected to Islamic State.Describing Choudary as a ‘highly dangerous fanatical extremist’, prisons minister Rory Stewart has promised that he will be subject to round-the-clock surveillance.Under the terms of his early release, which cannot be prevented under current law, he will be housed in a probation hostel in London for six months, away from his family home in Ilford in the east of the city, and must remain within the area bounded by the M25 motorway.            There are fears Choudary, who previously mocked up a picture of Buckingham Palace as a mosque, could go back to radicalising young men after his release this weekHe will be electronically tagged, subject to a curfew, banned from preaching and attending certain mosques, allowed to associate only with ‘approved’ people and barred from using the internet. A single mobile phone is allowed – but subject to examination at any time. In addition, Choudary’s assets have been frozen, and he will be subject to strict limits on financial activity.MI5 and intelligence agency GCHQ will participate in the surveillance operation targeting the preacher, but pressure on resources makes continuous physical surveillance less likely. With 23,000 potential extremists at large, they have their hands full.Choudary spent most of his sentence at Frankland high-security prison in County Durham. It is one of three institutions in Britain equipped with a separation unit, a ‘prison-within-a-prison’ intended to isolate terrorists from ordinary inmates.            Choudary is barred from contacting partner-in-crime Mohammed Mizanur RahmanChoudary, whose release date takes into account time spent on curfew and remand before his trial, was allowed to associate only with a handful of similar prisoners, and subject to psychological and spiritual counselling involving an approved imam.Much good it did him – he is reported to be as extreme as ever and has been penning a book chronicling his ‘martyrdom’. ‘Choudary may not have coached suicide bombers directly,’ says David Videcette, a former counter-terrorism officer,’ but he is the calibre of person who would do such a thing. A person thinking of sacrificing his or herself for Allah, in Syria or elsewhere, will seek this man’s approval, and he has the contacts to make this ambition a reality.’Now he is expected to tread very carefully, giving the authorities no excuse to send him back to prison.‘He is aware of what the law allows him to say and what not to say, and he rarely steps over the line,’ adds Mr Videcette. ‘He knows how not to get himself into trouble – we were extremely lucky to find some material showing him promoting IS that allowed us to put him away. He remains a danger to anyone with whom he comes into contact – those who are vulnerable and impressionable.’Choudary studied medicine at Southampton University but failed his first-year exams and took up law. As an undergraduate, he was known as Andy, a ‘party animal’ who indulged his appetite for alcohol, cannabis and women.Estrangement from British society began with his failure to secure a job in a top law firm and he began to gravitate towards extremism, becoming a disciple of Syrian-born Islamist preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad. Together, the men founded al-Muhajiroun (ALM), a shadowy organisation promoting a hardline version of Islam.All the time, he and his equally radical wife, and their children, were sustained by benefits from the state they both profess to loathe – totalling some £20,000 a year in child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits.An incubator for terrorism, al-Muhajiroun was proscribed in 2010 but re-emerged under a series of new names such as Muslims Against Crusades. Bakri had left the UK in 2005, leaving Choudary as the guiding light of the Islamist movement here.A narcissist with a taste for the limelight, he was adept at courting media attention. In his vision of the future, the black flag of the caliphate will fly over Buckingham Palace and Downing Street, and the Queen will be forced to cover her face, he repeatedly told journalists. In 2010, he led a protest in the Wiltshire market town of Wootton Bassett, through which the coffins of British servicemen killed in action in Afghanistan were paraded and honoured after being flown in to nearby RAF Lyneham.‘Goading is part of his strategy,’ says Mr Videcette. ‘He wants to drive a wedge between the Muslim community and the secular community. Terrorism is about polarising views – Muslims are left alone by the main population and that allows extremists to thrive within that community.‘Choudary is one of the few public faces of Islamist extremism. There are not many people with his public persona, but several hundred who behind closed doors share his views. He is at the top of a hierarchical structure that at its base has about 20,000 people who are known to have contact with these hundreds of advisers.’As a young man, Adam Deen was seduced by the simplistic ‘Muslims against the rest’ message of ALM and joined the group. Now a director of the anti-extremist organisation Quilliam, he warns that the impending release of Islamist leaders like Choudary from prison could re-energise groups whose ranks have been thinned by deaths in Syria and other causes.‘Restrictions are not going to stop Anjem’s act,’ says Mr Deen. ‘Be it middle-men or whoever, he will find a way to make an impact. I would be very surprised if he has in any way been reformed by prison. He has too much invested in his image. Some think he doesn’t mean what he says, but he does. It’s the scariest thing about him.’            The new counter-terrorism bill should reduce the legal threshold for incitement, making it easier to prosecute the Choudarys of this worldSentences for most Islamist extremists in the UK have been relatively short due to the effective tactic of convicting them for conventional crimes. About half of known extremists were found guilty of other forms of criminality.This approach resulted in a spate of arrests but now many of those offenders are coming up for release, presenting the already stretchedsecurity services with a fresh headache. A BBC Newsnight report this week cited Akbar Dad Khan, a moderate Muslim councillor in Luton, who warns that al-Muhajiroun is far from a spent force and that ‘thousands’ of Muslims continue to support its aims.Imprisonment has failed to dent the enthusiasm of many extremists, and Britain’s embattled penal system has, if anything, served as a breeding ground for radicalism. Separation units are not billed as a punishment but as a precaution. So Islamist extremists enjoy access to television, participate in Friday prayers and are entitled to a halal diet.The separation unit at Frankland has been described as ‘successful’ but ‘claustrophobic’ by prison monitors. The three separation units in the country can hold just 28 prisoners in total.Before he tripped himself up over endorsing IS, Choudary was happy to exploit his country’s protection of free speech while rubbishing the freedom that allowed him to exercise it. ‘You see, we don’t believe in the concepts of freedom and democracy,’ he told an interviewer. ‘We believe sovereignty belongs to God.’Extolling the dystopian horror that was the so-called caliphate established by IS in Syria and Iraq, he went on: ‘They don’t see in the public arena things like alcohol, drugs, gambling, these kinds of vices. They’ve been completely wiped out.‘In many respects it’s the kind of society I’d love to live in with my family.’Radicalism is certainly a feature of the Choudary household. In 1996, Anjem married Rubana Akhtar, then 22. She proved to be every bit as extreme as her husband, being secretly filmed in 2016 speaking in favour of IS, making light of the burning to death in a cage of a captured Jordanian fighter pilot and predicting the destruction of the non-Muslim population of Britain.Their daughter, Hediya Mehraj, appears to have followed in her parents’ footsteps. In 2013, the then 16-year-old used Twitter to urge Muslims to wage holy war in Syria.The new counter-terrorism bill should reduce the legal threshold for incitement, making it easier to prosecute the Choudarys of this world. But the hate preacher of Ilford will be on his guard.‘Choudary was hard to catch in the first place and will be harder to catch in future,’ says Mr Videcette. ‘These people become skilled at countering electronic surveillance. They leave their phones in separate rooms and conduct business in open spaces. Messages will be passed by hand, and important contacts made through third parties.‘Our best bet is to make him as paranoid as possible. We will be looking to feed agents into his circle – people who will be recording him. Yes, we are going to bug his phone yes, we are going to break into his house and bug it and yes, we are going to install bugs in his car. Yes, every single person he talks to could be an agent.‘But we need to be at the top of our game. We are going to be stuck with him for some time.’Understandably, moderate Muslims are alarmed at the prospect of Choudary’s release. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain says: ‘Mr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh (IS) to be despicable.‘Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia.’Surely the best thing to do – when once again Anjem Choudary attempts to spread his own special brand of hatred – is to ignore him. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/19/08/5170DDDB00000578-0-image-a-16_1539935700834.jpg","title":"Man wearing wing suit jumps Swiss Alps","story":"    Daredevil Steve Shipman regularly posts himself doing stunts on his Youtube channelWingsuit flying involves a special jumpsuit, sometimes called a birdman suit, to travel through the air.  The extreme sport has soared in popularity in its short history of around sixteen years.The Nylon suits have chambers in webbing between the legs, and between the arms and body and inflate in freefall making jumpers capable of twisting and turning at more than 100mph.Shipman regularly posts videos of himself performing extreme sports on his Youtube channel and has garnered thousands of views from his subscribers.But, wingsuit flying has a dangerous reputation even by the standards of \u0027extreme\u0027 sports with 38 people dying in 2017 after falling to their deaths in ill-fated cruises from cliffs and mountainsides.Swimmer is mauled by a shark in New Zealand Hindu temple is attacked by vandals who light fires and...Share this article    Steve Shipman can be seen jumping from the point in the mountains known as \u0027Fatal Attraction\u0027 and effortlessly swooping through the air over Walenstadt, Switzerland          The daredevil flawlessly lands on his feet on the ground after dropping from 5,400 ft in the air from the point in the Swiss AlpsIn July of this year a British man died after he performed a base jump wearing a wing suit in the Swiss Alps.The 38-year-old\u0027s death was undetermined but according to the public prosecutor  \u0027he found himself in difficulty\u0027 shortly after his departure before falling to the ground.

It’s a lovely house but it needs people in it.“I did wonder whether whoever buys it would let us come back and have another wedding.“It would be nice to carry on the family tradition.”          The 170-year-old listed Scottish church has been converted into a beautiful family home with stone archways and leaded windows          The stone arches and arched windows, as well as the vaulted ceilings, are a visual reminder of the home\u0027s former useAs a young boy her father Scott, who now has Alzheimer’s’, would go to Sunday School in the vestry - which is now his daughter’s front room.Amanda said it was “love at first sight” when she first visited the house.She added: “There were three churches in the area and this is where weddings were held.“It has got a lovely feel about it - it has definitely got a very happy and peaceful vibe.“I think that everyone who has stayed here has noticed it, it has got a comforting feel.“I’d like to think it’s from all the blessings and marriages.”After buying Church House, Amanda and Sandy stayed in a small cottage in nearby Ceres, Fife, while they overhauled it and drastically changed the design.They knocked two bedrooms into one larger one, with an en-suite bathroom and dressing room.And the couple took care to preserve the original features of the building, including the carved pillars which Amanda says are of a quality close to those of the Rosslyn Chapel, which inspired Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.The stone arches inside the building, and on the original windows, are a visual reminder of its former use - and one wooden pew was preserved by the family.Amanda said: “We are really pleased with the bedroom - when we first bought it there were two bedrooms upstairs but we felt they weren’t grand enough for the house.“It is a lovely space with lots of light - I just don’t know how we are going to replace it.          The couple took care to preserve the original features of the building, including the carved pillars which Amanda says are as good as those in Rosslyn Chapel which features in Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.

Mr Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy (pictured) in London since 2012This can include sharing their social media usernames, the serial numbers and codes of their phones and tablets, with Ecuador - which the protocol says the government may \u0027share with other agencies\u0027.The protocol claims the Embassy may seize the property of Mr Assange or his visitors and, without a warrant, hand it over to UK authorities, said the statement.WikiLeaks said that US congressmen had written an open letter to Ecuador\u0027s president, Lenin Moreno, saying that in order to advance \u0027crucial matters ... from economic co-operation to counternarcotics assistance, to the possible return of a USAID mission to Ecuador, we must first resolve a significant challenge created by your predecessor, Rafael Correa - the status of Julian Assange\u0027.Pressure has mounted on Ecuador to hand Mr Assange over to the UK, WikiLeaks believes.It is understood that the theme of the legal action will be on Mr Assange\u0027s isolation, ban on visits, speech restrictions, and failure to live up to international obligations.Earlier this week a document was leaked which showed tensions were growing between Mr Assange and his hosts.The list included demands for Mr Assange to keep the bathroom clean, take good care of his cat or it will be confiscated and to steer clear of topics that could harm Ecuador\u0027s diplomatic interests. The document also stated that Assange must tell officials the serial number and model of all his devices and will have to pay for his own medical evaluations and food.Embassy staff said he couldn\u0027t use any \u0027communication equipment\u0027 except his computer and mobile phone and reserved the right to seize his equipment. Mr Assange was also limited to three visitors at once, the document said, adding that they will have to get written permission from the ambassador at least three days in advance.However the nine-page memo published by Ecuadorean website Codigo Vidrio did reveal that that his WiFi has been restored. Assange\u0027s lawyers rejected the new rules, in place since Saturday 13 October , saying they \u0027violate international agreements\u0027 and \u0027a prison regime is being imposed on him.\u0027 Mr Assange initially moved into the embassy after he was accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, but the investigation was dropped in 2017.As he breached his bail conditions by seeking Ecuadorian asylum, he could potentially be arrested by UK authorities, and so he remains at the embassy.Despite an initial warm welcome, the Ecuadorians have reportedly grown increasingly tired of their live-in guest.It was reported in September that the Ecuador government cut off Assange\u0027s phone and internet access earlier this year and banned people visiting him. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/07/4E3870EC00000578-5582477-image-a-2_1531980034359.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment shocked pooch stares space caught attention","story":"A hilarious video shows the moment Cooper the weimeraner stares off into space while chewing a bone. Cooper was sitting next to his owner on their sofa when something apparently caught his attentionHis oblivious owner was staring at her phone while Cooper stared straight ahead, blinking occasionally.According to his owner, Cooper loves to sit on the couch with his family. \u0027Unfortunately, something caught his eye and he froze with a shocked expression on his face with the bone still in his mouth,\u0027 his owner said. Chubbs the monster alligator is spotted for the first time...Hilarious moment Bean the dog gets envious when his owner...Hogging the snacks!

You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up. \u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 The couple\u0027s \u0027surprise\u0027 appearance at the school on Friday turned out to be the worst-kept secret on campus.As Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, teased them about being overexcited to see her, the teenagers fizzed with anticipation until the Duke and Duchess were finally introduced. Then, cheers and excited screams filled the air as they walked outside to meet the well-behaved girls, who had been sitting neatly for assembly. Invited to sit on a park bench in the centre, the couple watched a ballet-inspired dance performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027 before heading inside for the workshops.           The program aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027          Invited to sit on a park bench, the couple watched a ballet-inspired performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027The couple earlier went to Bondi Beach, one of Australia\u0027s most famous landmarks, to meet a local community surfing group known as One Wave.It was founded by Grant Trebilco who suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them.He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.When he came out, he said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He has now created \u0027Fluro Fridays\u0027 where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Harry and Meghan, who was wearing a sleeveless Martin Grant dress with espadrille tie wedges, were both given brightly-coloured \u0027leis\u0027 - garlands of flowers - to put round their necks in order to enter into the spirit of things.Accompanied by Trebilco, they kicked off their shoes on the edge of the beach and walked barefoot to sit in a group with some of the colourfully-dressed surfers.

You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.          One member of the circle said he could \u0027see the passion\u0027 for awareness of mental health in the couples\u0027 eyes          Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go          The royal couple pictured with garlands of flowers, or \u0027leis\u0027, dangling around their necks as they walk through the sand          Thousands of well-wishers came out to Sydney\u0027s iconic Bondi Beach to see the royal couple on Friday morningStuart Klees, 34, of Bondi, said: \u0027Harry shared his views on mental health towards everyone.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in normalising the conversation around mental health.\u0027He feels fortunate that he\u0027s in a position to get the right people together to spread that message.\u0027He\u0027s a big supporter of small community groups like One Wave.\u0027Prince Harry talked to the group about his own issues with mental health.\u0027He said he\u0027s seen a couple of counsellors before and never found one that suits him,\u0027 Klees said.\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in having normal conversations with normal people.\u0027He was pretty genuine, real honest, real open, real relaxed.\u0027He wasn\u0027t trying to put on a show. He was really genuine in the way he came across.\u0027As she left, Meghan told the group that she was \u0027loving\u0027 her first experience of Australia. \u0027It is so great to be here,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/19/07/5170C1C000000578-6293371-image-a-90_1539932289944.jpg","title":"Prince Harry arrives climb Sydney Harbour Bridge","story":"    Prince Harry scaled the Sydney Harbour Bridge alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison (second form left) and Invictus Games athletes (right) for one of the best views of the city          The group scaled the iconic bridge in quick time with former soldier Harry leading the charge of the 1,322 steps          The Duke of Sussex walks at the head of the group followed by Mr Morrison and the four Invictus Games competitors           In another shot just after they arrived, the Opera House and Sydney CBD is visible in the backgroundAlso participating in the climb is Gwen Cherne, whose late husband served in Cambodia, Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. Meghan was originally tabbed to participate in the climb, but her name was mysteriously removed from the itinerary a month earlier.The reasoning wasn\u0027t clear until this past Monday, when it was announced she was pregnant.The Duke swapped his blazer and trousers for a short sleeved black shirt as he made quick pace up the bridge, swapping his position between up to a dozen others to chat to different climbing companions.However, he decided to forgo the goofy bright blue jumpsuit thousands of tourists have been photographed wearing as they smile at the arch’s summit.As luck would have it, the morning clouds and fog cleared up by the time he began his ascent about 3pm, treating him to an unblemished view as a flag advertising the Invictus Games flew next to the Australian flag.Sexual assault gang served with jail sentencesTeenager was disowned by his mother for giant facial tumourHarry and Meghan bond with their fans on Sydney\u0027s Bondi BeachSHOCKING moment pensioner is viciously attacked in BirminghamMoment backpacker sprays \u0027Scouse Lee\u0027 on 800-year-old Thai fortressBaffled girlfriend gets answer to riddle wrong THREE timesCCTV footage shows kidnapping of Hannah Cornelius and friendMoment youth pulls knife in South London street altercationCar seen departing as preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prisonAnjem Choudary poses for cameras after prison releaseBungling airport worker destroys \u0026quotvery pricey\u0026quot engine of a Boeing 747Jermaine Pennant jokes about lie detector test on Jeremy Kyle    Prince Harry arrived at the Sydney Harbour Bridge for his afternoon climb of the 134-metre icon          The Duke of Sussex climbed the bridge alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison while Meghan waited below          After stopping to admire the view, the group headed down the other side of the bridge after crossing the           Harry paused at the summit of the climb, pointing out landmarks across the city with his right arm          The pilgrimage, almost mandatory for any Sydney visitor, follows a comprehensive safety briefing with climbers hooked up to wires running up the steel structure throughout the climbWhen they made it to the top, Harry, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and four others posed side-by-side for a memorable photo with the harbour and Opera House in the background.Mr Morrison appeared out of breath when the group reached the summit, but former military man Harry looked relaxed and unfazed by the arduous climb. \u0027The Sydney Harbour Bridge is an Australian icon and I can think of no better place to raise the Invictus Games Sydney 2018 flag,\u0027 Mr Morrison said earlier in the day.\u0027It will be especially wonderful for the Duke and me to share this moment with members of the Australian Team before they get ready to compete for Australia.\u0027          Harry climbed the iconic bridge with a party of up to a dozen, swapping his position between them to chat to different people during the ascent.

Tahlia Ohenhen, 15, told the Duke and Duchess how another group had created picture books to teach younger children about poverty and encourage them to treat those less fortunate with kindness and empathy.The couple nodded as Tahlia added: \u0027The younger you get your children educated on things like this, the easier it is for them to grow up and be aware of it and make a difference.\u0027 \u0027Kindness and empathy lacks big time in the world,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027It\u0027s so great you are passionate about all of this. \u0027You realise this is the generation that\u0027s going to make all the difference?\u0027           Teachers explained that the girls have been taking an \u0027integrated course\u0027 on top of their usual studies, to give them \u002721st century capabilities\u0027 including creativity and critical thinking          The Duchess of Sussex told students how her upbringing at an all-girls school and her first job \u0027taking out the trash\u0027 has made her \u0027the person she is today\u0027          The royals look on during their surprise visit to the school in Sydney\u0027s west on Friday. The pair were entertained with a dance to the Frankie Goes To Hollywood version of The Power of Love          A student\u0027s tribute to Meghan is pictured during her visit to Macarthur Girls High School in Sydney on FridayLater, the Duke and Duchess were introduced to teenage boys and girls from the NRL\u0027s In League In Harmony project, which aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027. Sitting separately, with a mixed-sex group each, the couple listened to young people\u0027s growing up in Australia, and day-to-day lives. As one young man told the Duchess about his part-time job, she empathised: \u0027My first job when I was 14, I remember taking out the trash, all sorts. It give you a good work ethic, right?\u0027 She joined groups of students from across different schools in Sydney who have been introduced via the programme, which teaches them: \u0027Everybody belongs.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s so important,\u0027 said the Duchess. \u0027All these people you know of in your neighbourhood, now you know them and you\u0027re united. You\u0027re proud of where you\u0027re from, you can champion where you\u0027re from and make people see it for what it is.\u0027 Harry, sitting with a second group of youngsters, joked that he was \u0027clinging onto my youth at the age of 34,\u0027 said he now looked to the younger generation for inspiration. \u0027We\u0027re so lucky that wherever we go in the world, we\u0027re finding young people like you guys,\u0027 he said. \u0027This sweeping wave of kindness and optimism and empathy that\u0027s seems to be lacking in some of the previous generation. You guys get a kick out of that, right?\u0027            Schoolgirls wait eagerly with their mobile phones ready to go before the arrival of the royal mother and father-to-be   Meghan and Harry held hands as they made their way to the sand on Friday, with the Duchess placing her left hand over her stomach           Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry are seen with local surfing community group \u0027OneWave\u0027 on Bondi Beach          Harry and Meghan thrilled thousands of royal fans at Sydney\u0027s Bondi Beach.

She said it helps ground her and she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine.\u0027Ms Oakes also spoke to Meghan about the dangers of social media, particulary it\u0027s effect on young people\u0027s self image.\u0027She said a really beautiful quote. She said flattery and criticism run through the same filter.\u0027She said it was very freeing that she no longer has social media.\u0027And just how great One Wave is making those connections with people and being able to support one another.\u0027Harry and Meghan¿s great Aussie day out!

Harry talked about how everyone has their different recipe and how much sports can help with your mental health.\u0027He said he and Meghan had surfed before. We tried to get him in and told him we had a wet suit and surf board ready for him, but he said he couldn\u0027t. They were so engaging, they had time for everyone and really felt part of the One Wave community.\u0027 Mr Trebilco suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them. He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.He said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He then created Fluro Fridays - where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Sexual assault gang served with jail sentencesTeenager was disowned by his mother for giant facial tumourHarry and Meghan bond with their fans on Sydney\u0027s Bondi BeachSHOCKING moment pensioner is viciously attacked in BirminghamMoment backpacker sprays \u0027Scouse Lee\u0027 on 800-year-old Thai fortressBaffled girlfriend gets answer to riddle wrong THREE timesCCTV footage shows kidnapping of Hannah Cornelius and friendMoment youth pulls knife in South London street altercationCar seen departing as preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prisonAnjem Choudary poses for cameras after prison releaseBungling airport worker destroys \u0026quotvery pricey\u0026quot engine of a Boeing 747Jermaine Pennant jokes about lie detector test on Jeremy Kyle    The royal couple also met and shared jokes with local lifeguards (left), made famous by television series Bondi Rescue          Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan are pictured meeting a young child during their Bondi Beach visit on Friday  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on their official 16-day Autumn tour visiting cities in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand          Meghan is seen preparing to take part in OneWave\u0027s mental health awareness session on the sand at the world-famous beach          Meghan is seen laughing as she mingled with locals on Friday morning. She and Harry spent about half an hour on the sand\u0027To have the duke and duchess down at Flouro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 Mr Trebilco said.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It\u0027s a sign of strength. Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health. It reduces that barrier.

He is not some sort of evil genius we all need to be afraid of.\u0027We have to recognise that radicalisers look to generate a profile, they look to prey on the vulnerable.\u0027We need to be thoughtful about how we report their activity.\u0027                                                    The hate preacher branded the most dangerous man in Britain will live at the property under the strictest conditions ever imposed on a released prisoner.The hate preacher will remain at the hostel after serving half his five year and a half year sentence for pledging allegiance to ISIS.One trader, who asked not to be named, said: \u0027It is sickening knowing he is so close.\u0027They should find another place for him away from the community.

He\u0027s done too much damage\u0027. The Government has launched a campaign to debunk his influence and ridicule with Whitehall sources calling him a \u0027shameless coward\u0027 who was \u0027too scared\u0027 to go to war himself so encouraged vulnerable young men to go instead.The insider told the Telegraph: \u0027Choudary is just a coward. He has never travelled anywhere to fight and yet has been happy to see followers go abroad to wage jihad and die. \u0027He doesn\u0027t care about them. He is happy to radicalise vulnerable young men and send them to fight. But he is too scared to go. He is no martyr\u0027.           Neighbours are irate that Choudary is living next door to a primary in his bail hostel Choudary was to a probation hostel after serving half his sentence for swearing an oath of allegiance to Islamic State – despite security experts warning the \u0027Pied Piper of jihad\u0027 would inspire more terror attacks.However, he will be subject to a huge security operation, including surveillance teams, monitoring devices and demands that he adhere to up to 25 rules controlling his activities.          Anjem Choudary has been released from prison after serving just half his five-and-a-half year sentenceChoudary, 51, a married father of five, is one of Britain\u0027s most notorious firebrand clerics. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years for inviting support for ISIS, but was given automatic release after serving half his sentence. The judge who sent him to prison in 2016, Mr Justice Holroyde, said he would be dangerous in jail and on release.He told him at the Old Bailey: \u0027You show no remorse at all for anything you have said or done and I have no doubt you will continue to communicate your message whenever you can\u0027. His unpopular  release came as:■Campaigners said he remained \u0027Britain\u0027s most dangerous extremist\u0027 after research showed he is already linked to over 120 Islamist terrorists.■It was revealed that the huge security surrounding him is estimated to cost the taxpayer more than £2million a year - compared to the £50,000 to keep him in jail.■An imam who has met Choudary in jail suggested he had used human rights laws to be placed in a half-way house in North London – close to where he used to preach – by claiming he had to be near his children.The release is a landmark moment for the Government, which is still reeling from a string of atrocities which left more than 30 dead last year.          Hate preacher Anjem Choudary pictured in the 1990s as a student drinking with friends who are reading Mayfair magazineThe preacher, who once led banned group Al-Muhajiroun, was sentenced in 2016. Fiyaz Mughal, head of anti-extremist group Faith Matters, has spoken to the imam who was brought into jail to try to de-radicalise him.\u0027Choudary was put in containment that stops him engaging with other prisoners, but also given pastoral care to see if they could get through to him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I asked the guy who spoke to him if the de-radicalisation programme had worked and he said, \u0027No, he\u0027s got worse. He\u0027s hardened\u0027. He speaks in the mind-set of the victim. He sees himself as a martyr the state tried to silence.\u0027Choudary does not plan to directly challenge the conditions of his release, but instead is working out ways to get round them, Mr Mughal said.\u0027He\u0027s said things like, \u0027if someone wants to upload my videos I\u0027m not going to stop them\u0027.\u0027Mr Mughal added: \u0027He should have served the full term. It\u0027s a terrible day for victims of the attacks he has helped incite.\u0027We need a change in the law so that anyone named as the inciter in two terrorist attacks should automatically serve the full sentence.\u0027Dr Michael Kenney, of the University of Pittsburgh, who followed Al-Muhajiroun for five years for his research, said its followers were \u0027very excited\u0027 about his release.They had been dormant following his arrest, but are now expected to try to \u0027rebuild and revitalise\u0027, he said.And he warned it was \u0027entirely possible\u0027 that more of his followers would turn to terrorism, like Khuram Butt, who was part of last year\u0027s London Bridge terror attack and Lee Rigby killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.Security expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said: \u0027He is charismatic and a very gifted orator – he is the Pied Piper of Jihad.\u0027Those who are vulnerable to his warped messages will see him as a hero … who has been through the fire of imprisonment.\u0027Security sources say Choudary\u0027s conviction has raised his credibility among fanatics. In the past, his desire not to go to prison and, what was seen in some quarters as his cowardice by not going to Syria, raised suspicions that he was a stooge for the security services.      Hate preacher Anjem Choudary - who inspired some of Britain\u0027s most notorious terrorists - is to be released on Friday and moved to a bail hostel Campaign group Hope not Hate found he has been directly or indirectly linked to at least 123 Islamist terrorists.\u0027Anjem Choudary will remain the most dangerous extremist in Britain today,\u0027 said Nick Lowles, chief executive. \u0027This is a man who has inspired dozens to commit acts of violence.\u0027The security operation will include surveillance teams, monitoring devices and demands that Choudary adhere to up to 25 rules. He also faces being targeted by UN sanctions to freeze his assets, prevent him travelling and even enforce \u0027arms embargo provisions\u0027.Theresa May yesterday insisted safeguards were place to protect people from him.  Web of hate: How Anjem Choudary\u0027s sermons inspired a generation of home-grown terrorists and radicals The hate-filled circle around Anjem Choudary was a breeding ground for the Islamic extremism which plagued Britain in the last two decades.Former law-student Choudary, who previously called for adulterers to be stoned to death and branded UK troops \u0027cowards\u0027, always hid behind free speech rules whenever challenged by the authorities.But the group he helped to set up were linked to a series of terrorist attacks, as easily-influenced young men became inspired by his twisted vision of jihad.The best known of his disciples was Muslim convert Michael Adebolajo, who, along with Michael Adebowale, attacked Fusilier Lee Rigby with a meat cleaver in Woolwich in 2013 in a murder which shocked the country.            Anjem Choudary was at the centre of a web of extremists who operated in LondonAdebolajo was a supporter of Choudary\u0027s al-Muhajiroun group and was pictured standing behind the hate preacher in 2007.After the incident, Choudary said Adebolajo was \u0027a practising Muslim and a family man\u0027 who he was \u0027proud of\u0027.But he denied encouraging the killer to carry out the attack, insisting he was \u0027channeling the energy of the youth through demonstrations and processions\u0027.London Bridge attacker Khuram Butt  also joined one of Choudary\u0027s rallies, this time on College Green outside the Palace of Westminster in 2013.There, Butt \u0027verbally assaulted\u0027 a moderate Muslim leader who had opposed Choudary\u0027s extremist rhetoric.Meanwhile, Mohammed Reza Haque, thought of as Choudary\u0027s bodyguard, disappeared from Britain in 2014.  London Bridge attacker Kharum Butt (left) and Westminster attacker Khalid Masood (right)A photograph taken in Syria showed him in a balaclava and camouflage clothing, brandishing an AK-47 assault rifle and he has since been suspected as being a tall figure in ISIS\u0027s horrific execution films.Siddhartha Dhar, who once ran Choudary\u0027s media operation, was also seen posing in a military style coat and boots, brandishing an assault rifle and holding his new born baby in Syria, labelling the picture \u0027Generation Khilafah\u0027.In December 2014, two other close associates were discovered in the back of a lorry at Dover as they tried to leave the country.Westminster attacker Khalid Masood was also linked to Choudary through Ibrahim Anderson, an al-Muhajiroun activist  convicted of inviting support for ISIS in 2016.  Will this fanatic branded despicable by fellow Muslims spark a new terror wave, asks NEIL TWEEDIEHe laughs boorishly for the camera across a pub table crammed with half-drained pint glasses and cans of cider, while a friend sitting next to him flaunts a copy of a soft-porn magazine. As a young man – a failed medical student turned aspiring lawyer – Anjem Choudary liked porn, casual sex, booze and getting stoned.Now, at the age of 51, he prefers others to get stoned – but not on drugs. ‘For people who have had adultery committed against them, people who have had their wives taken, a lot will say: “I think stoning to death is appropriate”,’ he has said.Welcome to the warped, medieval world of Britain’s most virulent Islamist hate-preacher who, following his expected release from prison today, is back in circulation – albeit hemmed in by draconian restrictions on his freedom.Choudary, who was raised in Kent by Pakistani immigrant parents, is a man consumed with hatred for the liberal society that nurtured him, and a believer in the unforgiving rule of sharia law. In his universe, for every human weakness there is a brutally appropriate punishment, including crucifixion, and for every infidel a place in hellfire.            Hate preacher Anjem Choudary - who inspired some of Britain\u0027s most notorious terrorists - is to be released on Friday and moved to a bail hostel including Michael Adebolajo (left) who beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013This so-called cleric, who is not a recognised religious scholar, has inspired some of Britain’s most infamous Islamist terrorists, including Khuram Butt, leader of the London Bridge attacks in June last year, and Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby who was hacked to death in Woolwich in 2013.It is thought that more than 100 terrorists owe him some degree of allegiance, and many more acolytes have made their way to Syria to take part in jihad. Choudary, a qualified solicitor who used his skills to stay just the right side of the law during two decades of extolling extremism, was brought to justice after being caught expressing support for the banned terrorist sect Islamic State.Jailed for five and a half years at the Old Bailey in August 2016, he is now free on licence after serving half his sentence – to the frustration of those who understand the danger he represents.‘I would describe him as a hardened terrorist, somebody who has had huge influence on the Islamist extremist scene in this country over many years,’ says Richard Walton, a former head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. ‘I believe we are under-estimating the potency and danger of the radicalisers who don’t carry knives, guns and overtly plot terrorist attacks but who pollute the minds of young Muslim men.’During a debate in the House of Lords on the Government’s proposed counter-terrorism and border security Bill this month, Lord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said a quarter of jihadis convicted in Britain between 2001 and 2015 were ‘associated’ with Choudary, compared with a tenth linked to al-Qaeda and one in 20 connected to Islamic State.Describing Choudary as a ‘highly dangerous fanatical extremist’, prisons minister Rory Stewart has promised that he will be subject to round-the-clock surveillance.Under the terms of his early release, which cannot be prevented under current law, he will be housed in a probation hostel in London for six months, away from his family home in Ilford in the east of the city, and must remain within the area bounded by the M25 motorway.            There are fears Choudary, who previously mocked up a picture of Buckingham Palace as a mosque, could go back to radicalising young men after his release this weekHe will be electronically tagged, subject to a curfew, banned from preaching and attending certain mosques, allowed to associate only with ‘approved’ people and barred from using the internet. A single mobile phone is allowed – but subject to examination at any time. In addition, Choudary’s assets have been frozen, and he will be subject to strict limits on financial activity.MI5 and intelligence agency GCHQ will participate in the surveillance operation targeting the preacher, but pressure on resources makes continuous physical surveillance less likely. With 23,000 potential extremists at large, they have their hands full.Choudary spent most of his sentence at Frankland high-security prison in County Durham. It is one of three institutions in Britain equipped with a separation unit, a ‘prison-within-a-prison’ intended to isolate terrorists from ordinary inmates.            Choudary is barred from contacting partner-in-crime Mohammed Mizanur RahmanChoudary, whose release date takes into account time spent on curfew and remand before his trial, was allowed to associate only with a handful of similar prisoners, and subject to psychological and spiritual counselling involving an approved imam.Much good it did him – he is reported to be as extreme as ever and has been penning a book chronicling his ‘martyrdom’. ‘Choudary may not have coached suicide bombers directly,’ says David Videcette, a former counter-terrorism officer,’ but he is the calibre of person who would do such a thing. A person thinking of sacrificing his or herself for Allah, in Syria or elsewhere, will seek this man’s approval, and he has the contacts to make this ambition a reality.’Now he is expected to tread very carefully, giving the authorities no excuse to send him back to prison.‘He is aware of what the law allows him to say and what not to say, and he rarely steps over the line,’ adds Mr Videcette. ‘He knows how not to get himself into trouble – we were extremely lucky to find some material showing him promoting IS that allowed us to put him away. He remains a danger to anyone with whom he comes into contact – those who are vulnerable and impressionable.’Choudary studied medicine at Southampton University but failed his first-year exams and took up law. As an undergraduate, he was known as Andy, a ‘party animal’ who indulged his appetite for alcohol, cannabis and women.Estrangement from British society began with his failure to secure a job in a top law firm and he began to gravitate towards extremism, becoming a disciple of Syrian-born Islamist preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad. Together, the men founded al-Muhajiroun (ALM), a shadowy organisation promoting a hardline version of Islam.All the time, he and his equally radical wife, and their children, were sustained by benefits from the state they both profess to loathe – totalling some £20,000 a year in child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits.An incubator for terrorism, al-Muhajiroun was proscribed in 2010 but re-emerged under a series of new names such as Muslims Against Crusades. Bakri had left the UK in 2005, leaving Choudary as the guiding light of the Islamist movement here.A narcissist with a taste for the limelight, he was adept at courting media attention. In his vision of the future, the black flag of the caliphate will fly over Buckingham Palace and Downing Street, and the Queen will be forced to cover her face, he repeatedly told journalists. In 2010, he led a protest in the Wiltshire market town of Wootton Bassett, through which the coffins of British servicemen killed in action in Afghanistan were paraded and honoured after being flown in to nearby RAF Lyneham.‘Goading is part of his strategy,’ says Mr Videcette. ‘He wants to drive a wedge between the Muslim community and the secular community. Terrorism is about polarising views – Muslims are left alone by the main population and that allows extremists to thrive within that community.‘Choudary is one of the few public faces of Islamist extremism. There are not many people with his public persona, but several hundred who behind closed doors share his views. He is at the top of a hierarchical structure that at its base has about 20,000 people who are known to have contact with these hundreds of advisers.’As a young man, Adam Deen was seduced by the simplistic ‘Muslims against the rest’ message of ALM and joined the group. Now a director of the anti-extremist organisation Quilliam, he warns that the impending release of Islamist leaders like Choudary from prison could re-energise groups whose ranks have been thinned by deaths in Syria and other causes.‘Restrictions are not going to stop Anjem’s act,’ says Mr Deen. ‘Be it middle-men or whoever, he will find a way to make an impact. I would be very surprised if he has in any way been reformed by prison. He has too much invested in his image. Some think he doesn’t mean what he says, but he does. It’s the scariest thing about him.’            The new counter-terrorism bill should reduce the legal threshold for incitement, making it easier to prosecute the Choudarys of this worldSentences for most Islamist extremists in the UK have been relatively short due to the effective tactic of convicting them for conventional crimes. About half of known extremists were found guilty of other forms of criminality.This approach resulted in a spate of arrests but now many of those offenders are coming up for release, presenting the already stretchedsecurity services with a fresh headache. A BBC Newsnight report this week cited Akbar Dad Khan, a moderate Muslim councillor in Luton, who warns that al-Muhajiroun is far from a spent force and that ‘thousands’ of Muslims continue to support its aims.Imprisonment has failed to dent the enthusiasm of many extremists, and Britain’s embattled penal system has, if anything, served as a breeding ground for radicalism. Separation units are not billed as a punishment but as a precaution. So Islamist extremists enjoy access to television, participate in Friday prayers and are entitled to a halal diet.The separation unit at Frankland has been described as ‘successful’ but ‘claustrophobic’ by prison monitors. The three separation units in the country can hold just 28 prisoners in total.Before he tripped himself up over endorsing IS, Choudary was happy to exploit his country’s protection of free speech while rubbishing the freedom that allowed him to exercise it. ‘You see, we don’t believe in the concepts of freedom and democracy,’ he told an interviewer. ‘We believe sovereignty belongs to God.’Extolling the dystopian horror that was the so-called caliphate established by IS in Syria and Iraq, he went on: ‘They don’t see in the public arena things like alcohol, drugs, gambling, these kinds of vices. They’ve been completely wiped out.‘In many respects it’s the kind of society I’d love to live in with my family.’Radicalism is certainly a feature of the Choudary household. In 1996, Anjem married Rubana Akhtar, then 22. She proved to be every bit as extreme as her husband, being secretly filmed in 2016 speaking in favour of IS, making light of the burning to death in a cage of a captured Jordanian fighter pilot and predicting the destruction of the non-Muslim population of Britain.Their daughter, Hediya Mehraj, appears to have followed in her parents’ footsteps. In 2013, the then 16-year-old used Twitter to urge Muslims to wage holy war in Syria.The new counter-terrorism bill should reduce the legal threshold for incitement, making it easier to prosecute the Choudarys of this world. But the hate preacher of Ilford will be on his guard.‘Choudary was hard to catch in the first place and will be harder to catch in future,’ says Mr Videcette. ‘These people become skilled at countering electronic surveillance. They leave their phones in separate rooms and conduct business in open spaces. Messages will be passed by hand, and important contacts made through third parties.‘Our best bet is to make him as paranoid as possible. We will be looking to feed agents into his circle – people who will be recording him. Yes, we are going to bug his phone yes, we are going to break into his house and bug it and yes, we are going to install bugs in his car. Yes, every single person he talks to could be an agent.‘But we need to be at the top of our game. We are going to be stuck with him for some time.’Understandably, moderate Muslims are alarmed at the prospect of Choudary’s release. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain says: ‘Mr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh (IS) to be despicable.‘Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia.’Surely the best thing to do – when once again Anjem Choudary attempts to spread his own special brand of hatred – is to ignore him. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/04/15/03EF9FDF0000044D-0-image-a-60_1536071295077.jpg","title":"Turkish worshippers prayed wrong direction Mosque nearly four decades","story":"    A villager prays in the right direction indicated by the white lines painted on the carpetSaudi Arabia plans to build a \u0027Riviera of the Middle East\u0027...Muharram 2018: When does the Islamic New Year start and how...Share this articleThe muftis said the Mihrab, a niche built into the Mosque\u0027s wall to indicate the direction of Mecca, was facing the wrong way.It is thought that the mistake was a relic from the old mosque so villagers may have been praying in the wrong direction for many more years.The faith says that prayers should be directed towards the Kaaba which sits at the centre of Islam\u0027s most sacred site in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.As a temporary solution Mr Kaya laid down arrows of white tape to point his flock right, the Hurriyet Daily News said.

This attention to detail illustrates how important the design of the home was to the builder and the family who then owned it.           The kitchen was refitted in the 1980s but great care has been shown to the house over the years to maintain original features          Heol Bryngwili has three bedroom and some of the windows (pictured) have the classic ‘arrow’ design in the panels, these windows are an absolute ‘must-have’ in an authentic art deco home          Downstairs there is a glass panelled front door and the hall still has all the original woodwork, including a built-in telephone seating and storage area          Keeping art deco features, such as the feature tiled fireplace and arched alcove above, was very important to the designer of the house and the family who lived in itThe feature tiled fireplace with accent black horizontal tiling is straight out of a 1930s design book and has surely been the main gathering point for the family and visitors through the decades. The arched alcove above the fireplace again shows that art deco design was, and still is, an important aspect of this home.As was common decades ago, this front room would have probably been considered as the parlour, the posh room reserved for visitors and important family gatherings. The most used room by all family members would most likely have been the rear sitting room.In this family room the atmosphere is more relaxed. The room still has the crittall windows, pelmets and decorative coving but the fireplace is arguably less flamboyant than the front room and the built-in cupboards suggest a multi-functioning family room with the need for storage and bookshelves.This warm and cosy room still emanates the atmosphere of yesteryear and the life of a busy family using the space. Decades ago this room would have been the heart-of-the-home, not the kitchendiner as it is today.Updated during the 1980s the kitchen in this house is small by today’s standards. Although perfectly usable, there is scope for a new owner to create a spacious kitchendiner at the rear of the property.There are a number of small rooms behind the kitchen that could be incorporated into the space and luckily few art deco features remain here to destroy.There’s a boiler room, side entrance hallway and pantry that could all become part of a modern kitchendiner.            The carpeted sitting room has crittall windows and decorative coving as well as built in storage. Much of the furniture is also from the 1930s era and can be sold with the house          Upstairs there are three  bedrooms, with the master at the front of the house having direct access on to the curved balcony          Heol Bryngwili\u0027s current owners are selling as they\u0027d like to downsize and the property is surrounded by a lawn and garden          The family home near Llanelli also has a large garden at the back and a workshop (pictured) as well as a garageUpstairs there are three good sized bedrooms, with the master at the front of the house having direct access on to the curved balcony. Outside there is a rear garden which could be considered large for a suburban property, plus a lawned area at the side. There is a garage and workshop at the back of the land.This frozen in time property has always been owned by the same family and ideally the vendors are looking for a buyer that will love the original art deco features and 1930s style as much as they have. There’s even the possibility of some of the original furniture being included in the sale by negotiation. The house is on the market for £230,000 with estate agent Clee Tompkinson Francis Carmarthen branch."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/16/4EDAD36500000578-0-image-a-79_1533484366366.jpg","title":"Oxford applicants told not tie knows asked explain rock looks like","story":"    The university shared questions, which include asking students to describe a rockCandidates applying for an earth sciences course could be shown a picture of a rock and asked to explain what it looks like.Those wanting to study music could be asked about the different ways they listen to their favourite tunes - and potential history students could be quizzed on what historians cannot know about the past. Osama bin Laden\u0027s mother says the son of \u0027terror mastermind\u0027...REVEALED: Facebook data collected by Cambridge Analytica was...Baffled girlfriend gets the answer to a riddle wrong THREE...Share this articleOxford\u0027s director of admissions, Samina Khan, advises candidates not to be afraid to give the most obvious answer first.     \u0027Solving the problem quickly is less important than showing how you use information and analysis to get there.             Oxford university (pictured)  has released a list of sample questions and answersLaura Tunbridge, from St Catherine’s College, explained why a music candidate might be asked to explain the different ways they listen to music.\u0027The question allows students to use their own musical experiences as a starting point for a broader and more abstract discussion about the different ways people consume music, the relationship between music and technology, and how music can define us socially.\u0027\u0027We tend in Western Europe to be silent in concert halls: why might that be and what is the effect?

I believe the Conservative party is clearly the party of government and it’s my job to speak out when I feel that’s going awry.’Asked if he thought the Prime Minister needed to resign, he said: ‘No, absolutely not.’    Boris Johnson (pictured at the Tory party\u0027s annual conference in Birmingham earlier this month) backed Johnny Mercer after he launched an excoriating  attack on the PM          The former Foreign Secretary Johnny Mercer launched an extraordinary attack  on his own party\u0027s leadership, plunging the Tories into further civil warMr Mercer, 37, a father of two, heaped yet more pressure on Mrs May by lashing her leadership.He used an interview with The House magazine to say that with hindsight his pre-MP self \u0027wouldn\u0027t vote\u0027, adding: \u0027There\u0027s no doubt about it that my set of values and ethos, I was comfortable that it was aligned with the Conservative Party.\u0027I\u0027m not as comfortable that that\u0027s the case any more.\u0027Merkel and Macron tell Barnier to be more \u0027flexible\u0027 in...Share this articleAnd today Mr Johnson - who quit the Cabinet in fury at the PM\u0027s Chequers Brexit plan  - backed him.He tweeted: \u0027The Conservative Party is fortunate to have MPs with the passion and determination of Johnny Mercer - his fight for veterans shows why we need more like him.\u0027Mr Johnson\u0027s barb will heap more petrol on the fire engulfing the Tory party. Since his shock resignation from the cabinet in July, Mr Johnson has become one of Mrs May\u0027s  biggest critics.He has repeatedly thrown her premiership into turmoil by launching fiery attacks lashing her Chequers plan.And he cast a long shadow over the Tory party conference in Birmingham earlier this month by giving a talk to a huge fringe event on the eve of the PM\u0027s own keynote address.He sent Tory activists wild in the 1,500-seater hall by delivering a stark ultimatum that Mrs May must \u0027chuck\u0027 her Chequers blueprint, raging that it denied the result of the referendum and could even be illegal.     Mr Mercer is an Afghan veteran who served with 29 Commando, part of the Royal Artillery, before becoming an MP.    Johnny Mercer said he would never have run for Parliament under Theresa May (pictured in Brussels today). He fought and won Plymouth Moor View under David Cameron.He took his Devon seat from Labour in 2015 and increased his majority to more than 5,000 last year, but warned the party was being led by \u0027technocrats and managers\u0027 who were exposing it to \u0027ridicule\u0027 over Brexit.Since being elected he has joined the Defence Select Committee and campaigned for veterans, including those with mental health problems and others facing prosecution for alleged crimes during the Troubles.He gained notoriety and column inches after being elected when it emerged he had appeared in a shower gel advertisement, in which he was shown soaping himself while half naked.It is not the first time Mr Mercer has criticised the Conservatives from within.In November he told the Telegraph the party \u0027still seems punch-drunk\u0027 and was \u0027in danger of losing credibility\u0027 after the snap general election in 2017 which saw the Tories lose their majority in Westminster.The Remain supporter, who describes himself as being centre-right, told The House that Theresa May\u0027s Chequers deal was \u0027your classic professional politician\u0027s answer\u0027 that pleases no one.

Mr Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy (pictured) in London since 2012This can include sharing their social media usernames, the serial numbers and codes of their phones and tablets, with Ecuador - which the protocol says the government may \u0027share with other agencies\u0027.The protocol claims the Embassy may seize the property of Mr Assange or his visitors and, without a warrant, hand it over to UK authorities, said the statement.WikiLeaks said that US congressmen had written an open letter to Ecuador\u0027s president, Lenin Moreno, saying that in order to advance \u0027crucial matters ... from economic co-operation to counternarcotics assistance, to the possible return of a USAID mission to Ecuador, we must first resolve a significant challenge created by your predecessor, Rafael Correa - the status of Julian Assange\u0027.Pressure has mounted on Ecuador to hand Mr Assange over to the UK, WikiLeaks believes.It is understood that the theme of the legal action will be on Mr Assange\u0027s isolation, ban on visits, speech restrictions, and failure to live up to international obligations.Earlier this week a document was leaked which showed tensions were growing between Mr Assange and his hosts.The list included demands for Mr Assange to keep the bathroom clean, take good care of his cat or it will be confiscated and to steer clear of topics that could harm Ecuador\u0027s diplomatic interests. The document also stated that Assange must tell officials the serial number and model of all his devices and will have to pay for his own medical evaluations and food.Embassy staff said he couldn\u0027t use any \u0027communication equipment\u0027 except his computer and mobile phone and reserved the right to seize his equipment. Mr Assange was also limited to three visitors at once, the document said, adding that they will have to get written permission from the ambassador at least three days in advance.However the nine-page memo published by Ecuadorean website Codigo Vidrio did reveal that that his WiFi has been restored. Assange\u0027s lawyers rejected the new rules, in place since Saturday 13 October , saying they \u0027violate international agreements\u0027 and \u0027a prison regime is being imposed on him.\u0027 Mr Assange initially moved into the embassy after he was accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, but the investigation was dropped in 2017.As he breached his bail conditions by seeking Ecuadorian asylum, he could potentially be arrested by UK authorities, and so he remains at the embassy.Despite an initial warm welcome, the Ecuadorians have reportedly grown increasingly tired of their live-in guest.It was reported in September that the Ecuador government cut off Assange\u0027s phone and internet access earlier this year and banned people visiting him. "},{"url":null,"title":"Spooked father dashes upstairs spotting ghostly apparition","story":"    A ghostly figure was spotted on a baby monitor by a new father (pictured in the red circle)Suddenly he swears: \u0027What the f***?

By turns galumphing and graceful, the roughly £260m hulk contains an opera house, concert hall, theatre and recital hall, seating up to 7,000 people within its curvaceous shell. As Taiwan faces ever more pressure for assimilation from mainland China, whose cultural building boom has led to a new museum or concert hall open practically every week in recent years, the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts, AKA Weiwuying, is a monumental statement that this plucky nation means business on the international cultural stage.Gaping openings in the building’s hefty flanks beckon you into a cave-like landscape, where the floor rides up in great waves as the ceiling plunges down to meet the ground, forming a world of tunnels and canyons. The glossy-white steel skin is sliced open in places, bringing shafts of light into the space and offering intriguing glimpses of the venues within. It provides cooling respite from the tropical heat of this coastal city, channelling the breeze beneath its bulging belly to make a welcome place for picnics, tai-chi, yoga classes and some exhilarating swings.“We were struck by the informality of the performing arts in Taiwan,” says Dutch architect Francine Houben, whose practice, Mecanoo (designers of the Birmingham Library), won the competition for the project in 2007. “Chinese opera has its origins in street theatre, so we wanted to make a place that would feel as casual and informal as going to see a performance in the park.”The venue’s ambience is more that of a leisure centre than an opera house, particularly compared with Taipei’s national theatre and concert hall, each built in 1987, which stand on either side of the capital’s central square, like a pair of regal temples from the Forbidden City. By contrast, Weiwuying’s artistic director, Chien Wen-Pin, hopes people will spill into its theatres from the park, and treat it as their living room. “We had over 50,000 people turn up to our open day,” he says. “People occupied the space in a way were weren’t planning or expecting, taking their shoes off, doing exercise, lying in the shade, even breaking into song as they entered the concert hall.”Featuring the largest organ in Asia, designed as two thickets of bamboo with more than 9,000 pipes, the concert hall is a swirling symphony of oak and champagne-coloured seats, with a 22-tonne acoustic reflector dangling ominously from the ceiling. Despite its 2,000-person capacity, it feels surprisingly intimate, the furthest seat being 30 metres from the conductor. The Parisian magician of acoustics, Albert Xu, built a 1:10 model of it to ensure it provides the perfect reverberation time for everything from a classical orchestra to the twanging of the Taiwanese aboriginal mouth harp. He also worked his magic on the other three spaces, each designed with a distinct character and calibrated to accommodate a variety of art forms.The 434-seat recital hall has an asymmetrical seating layout, “so more people can see the pianists’ fingers”, say the architects, while its panelled walls can rotate to provide different levels of absorption, whether it’s hosting harsher classical Chinese music or jazz, or softer baroque chamber music. The playhouse, with deep blue seats, can accommodate an orchestra to the side of the stage (important for Chinese opera, where there must be a direct line of sight between the musicians and performers). Meanwhile, the deep red 2,236-seat opera house enjoys a humungous backstage, four times the size of the auditorium, conceived as a “theatre machine” that can contain the scenery and equipment for five different shows at once. “It’s even bigger and better equipped than Beijing’s opera,” Houben whispers conspiratorially about an important point of national pride.If the auditoria are exemplars of their kind, then the circulation and foyer space between them feels a little like an afterthought. With the four ovoid venues set in a rectangular volume stretching 225 metres long by 160 metres wide, there is a lot of leftover space, mainly decked out with acres of grey carpet, plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles, every surface painted black or white, giving it a rather bleak, monotonous feeling. Within the building there is little of the spatial drama promised by the undulating plaza outside. Instead, it has the air of a deep-plan office block with theatrical ambitions.The architects are quick to point out that the budget is actually very tight for a project of this scale, which necessitated some of the prosaic fittings. While Jean Nouvel’s Philharmonie de Paris cost £340m, and Herzog \u0026amp de Meuron’s Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg was a whopping £690m (each housing a single auditorium), Mecanoo has provided four theatres in one for a fraction of the price.The robust, rough-and-ready quality is also somehow appropriate for the nature of this no-nonsense port city. “We wanted it to have the detailing of a cargo ship, not a luxury yacht,” says Houben, referring to the visible steel welding joints between the panels of the building’s billowing white hull. Those who aren’t told of the container ship allusion might just think it is badly finished, but various nautical markings reinforce the seafaring air.The bigger question is if this city of three million, which has enjoyed a single 1,600-capacity theatre until now, has the ability to fill such an enormous complex on a regular basis. The director of the £106m National Taichung theatre, another ambitious cave-like opera house, an hour away by train and built by Toyo Ito in 2015, admits it is struggling to sell tickets to its current run of Wagner’s Siegfried, after the novelty of the venue’s opening has worn off. Taipei, meanwhile, awaits the opening of its long-delayed £133m performing arts centre designed by OMA, another theatre, concert hall and blackbox auditorium combined in a thrilling multilayered transformer of a building.It is an extraordinary abundance of venues for one country to be opening in the  of a few years, all planned in the mid-2000s by different regional and national administrations. As China picks off Taiwan’s allies with dollar diplomacy (only 17 countries now recognise the island as independent, thereby disqualifying themselves from formal relations with China), it seems as if cultural diplomacy is one of the few weapons it has left.If the palpable level of excitement in Kaohsiung on the opening night of Weiwuying last week is anything to go by – when tens of thousands gathered in the park for a spectacular gala performance staged on the building’s outdoor amphitheatre, complete with an aerial ballet of drones – there’s an eager population waiting to fill its great halls with life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9af15f05f8ee27474f83871afd44b2dd25a71779/426_484_4100_2460/master/4100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdce871344f14ff8eb8e494e2faf91b5","title":"brief answers to the big questions stephen hawking review","story":"This absorbing posthumous book draws on essays, lectures, speeches and the questions the physicist was so often askedThe late Stephen Hawking did not believe in an afterlife, but he has one all the same. He has appeared as a co-author in two posthumous research papers since he died in March. One takes a fresh look at the problem of just how complex the universe far beyond our horizon could be the other returns to the intractable but apparently not entirely insoluble problem of what happens to information once it falls into a black hole. This second paper is a response to a paradox that concerns only theoretical physicists but the first addresses the machinery of creation that seems to have needed no creator.Not surprisingly, he returns to both themes and many more in what his publishers call his final thoughts. Pioneering thinkers leave their names on their science. Hawking and Roger Penrose proved mathematically in 1965 that time, space and matter must have had a beginning in an infinitely small, dense point. Radioastronomers separately identified tantalising evidence of creation inscribed in the cosmos that year. Hawking also pursued another unknowable object to establish the theoretical reality of an elusive entity, instantly dubbed Hawking radiation, from within the forbidden frontiers of a black hole.There is no way of physically demonstrating the reality of either universal self-manufacture or Hawking radiation, but his scientific peers embrace his reasoning. His latest book is, however, a market test of what is known within the publishing world as the Hawking effect. A Brief History of Time joined the bestseller lists as soon as it appeared in 1988 and stayed there into the next decade. It sold more than 20m copies in 40 languages and turned an astronomer into a star, famous enough to twinkle in guest appearances in Star Trek and The Simpsons. It helped revive an appetite for popular science books, especially those with space for time, wonder, alien intelligence, superhumans and God.Brief Answers is one of his last projects, completed for him after he died. It draws on half a million or so words stored over the decades in the form of essays, lectures, keynote speeches and – since A Brief History of Time made him a celebrity and his long struggle against illness made him an icon – it addresses some of the questions that, over the decades, so many people had often asked him.Those who followed Hawking the writer after 1988 will find much that seems familiar. For those readers who invested in A Brief History and perhaps never quite finished it, there is good news: almost everything in Brief Answers is effortlessly instructive, absorbing, up to the minute and – where it matters – witty. There is a graceful foreword by Eddie Redmayne, who played Hawking in The Theory of Everything, the 2014 film of his life there is a thoughtful introduction by his colleague and friend Kip Thorne, the Californian scientist behind the identification, in 2016, of gravitational waves generated by the collision of two black holes there is a touching afterword by his daughter Lucy Hawking. In between, there are personal responses to the God question, the colonisation of space question, the artificial intelligence question, the survival of the planet question, and even his Desert Island Discs.The observable universe fashioned itself without a cause, and has a net energy of zero. “If the universe adds up to nothing, then you don’t need a God to create it. The universe is the ultimate free lunch,” he writes.It would be, he says “our worst mistake ever” to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction. “Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let’s make sure that wisdom wins.” He warns that human aggression and new technologies – nuclear warheads, AI, genetic engineering, global warming – could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. And he wants more manned space exploration. “If humanity is to continue for another million years, our future lies in going boldly where no one else has gone before.”People who argue for good education for all, a decently funded NHS and serious investment in research will rediscover him as a friend. He doesn’t think much of the anti-immigration ideologies of Brexit or Trump, but says so with brevity.And he concedes that despite all the amazing advances of cosmological physics in his lifetime, the final theory that defines why the universe is as it is, the theory of everything, seems as far away as it did in 1988. That doesn’t bother him. In the next 50 years, he says, “we will find out what happened at the big bang. We will come to understand how life began on earth. We may even discover whether life exists elsewhere in the universe.”As he says more than once, he prefers optimism to pessimism. “At one point I thought I would see the end of physics as we know it, but now I think the wonder of discovery will continue long after I am gone.”• Brief Answers to the Big Questions is published by John Murray.

In future, she said the new inspection regime would reward schools that offer a broad range of subjects, and would challenge those “where too much time is spent on preparation for tests at the expense of teaching, where pupils’ choices are narrowed or where children are pushed into less rigorous qualifications mainly to boost league-table positions”.The Society of Authors said it hoped the new approach would “go some way to addressing the current imbalance” in the number of children taking creative subjects – reports have pointed to a decline due to the expansion of the English baccalaureate, which excludes arts subjects.Children’s author Shoo Rayner, who chairs the society’s children’s writers and illustrators group, said that over the last few years authors visiting schools have “all noticed, and been dismayed by, the decline of creative subjects made available to children”.The author Piers Torday, whose novel The Dark Wild won the 2014  children’s fiction prize, said he was “so glad to hear Ofsted recognising that short-term linguistic metrics are not the only game in town”.The classroom has always been a creative space, he said, and “the innovation and inspiration this country urgently needs will come from allowing children to develop confidence in their own ideas by experimenting without fear of judgment. Teachers should be given the time and space to let their students play, explore and fail with words, and read widely for personal pleasure. Not only do we know that happy and confident reader-writers experience better long-term life outcomes, but the world urgently needs new stories to unite and inspire us. We must give today’s children the freedom to write their own future.”Bestselling novelist Joanne Harris agreed. “The education system seems to think that lessons are the only way for children to learn language,” she said. “Children learn from reading, not learning lists of words, and when they write creatively, they should write from their own language base, not some vocabulary list handed to them by adults. Creativity can (and should be) a pleasure. And taking pleasure in reading (and writing) is the way children learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0553ffa892a1dfce0ba4c785131e78bca47d835/337_859_3837_2301/master/3837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=725678fe3077d3443a8be5f4dd5dcd58","title":"family lexicon natalia ginzburg review","story":"“Dribbledrams! Doodledums! Nitwitteries!” These are a few of the signature eccentric sayings that Italian novelist and essayist Ginzburg ascribes to members of her family in this unusual portrait of everyday life in Italy from the 1920s to 50s. An experimental novel-cum-memoir first published in 1963, it features her parents, older siblings, in-laws, dissident friends and acquaintances, as well as those known through her mother’s oft-recounted reminiscences, who had “assumed the step of the dead, light and elusive”.The expressions recur through the book, becoming leitmotifs, character distillations that resonate as much through accumulation as explanation. She describes this idiosyncratic lexicon as “our Latin, the dictionary of our past” and “the basis of our family unity”. It forms the building blocks for a lovingly rendered, abruptly funny domestic scene, punctured only rarely by the surrounding political turbulence her husband’s death during the German occupation, for instance, is given just a sentence.“Novelists and poets had been starved of words during the fascist years,” notes the author in the face of this paucity, Family Lexicon celebrates the essential vitality of language.• Family Lexicon, translated by Jenny McPhee, is published by Daunt.

Now back in Karachi, he discusses the threats he’s faced and why he continues to speak outThey put GPS chips in pets and migratory birds now. How can someone flying around in a 65-million-dollar machine get lost?” With these words – spoken by a US airman who has just crashed his jet in an unnamed desert – Mohammed Hanif upends his own premise in the opening pages of his new novel. It is a typically bold manoeuvre from a satirical writer who was himself once a pilot – “a really bad one” – and whose work is full of references to military hardware. His Booker-longlisted debut A Case of Exploding Mangoes placed a cart of the fruit alongside Pakistan’s president Zia ul-Haq on a doomed C-130 Hercules his second told of a spirited convent nurse married off on a nuclear submarine. But jokey though his fiction appears, its political mission is Orwellian – his work is underpinned by a sense of a corrupt world that is constantly embattled. “I think I must have been at high school when the Afghan war started, so we grew up with these kinds of conflicts, and then they started to replicate themselves around the world. These wars never end. The attention just moves somewhere else,” says the 53-year-old novelist, journalist and occasional playwright.Never-ending war is the location of Red Birds, albeit one in which the bombing has mysteriously stopped. The lost airman, Major Ellie, is transported to a refugee camp by a young boy who discovers him while scouring the desert for his injured dog. The boy, Momo, is the book’s most vivid creation – an adolescent huckster who drives a “jeep Cherokee with a fat, fading USAid logo” and is hell-bent on rescuing his older brother from a sinister military base known as The Hangar.“People ask where it’s set and I say it’s set in my head,” says Hanif, who riffs that he had hoped to write a novel in which bad things can’t happen. “I know a lot of people who are very happy with their lives – who go around doing good things, or believing that they are doing good things.”Born in rural Pakistan, Hanif was working as a journalist in London when the World Trade Center attacks forced the west to confront the consequences of its warmongering, and has now settled back in Karachi. As the high-achieving son of a farming family, he grew up with parents who couldn’t read or write, but were regarded as pillars of wisdom in a community where being middle class meant that “at the bus station you don’t give them an address, you give them a name”. The first time his father went inside a school was for an awards ceremony when Hanif – one of six children – had won a prize. “I was eight or nine years old and I think he was secretly a bit proud of me,” he says.He went on to a government high school, but left home for the big city at 15 and a year later signed an 18-year contract with the Pakistan air force after spotting a newspaper recruitment ad. The air force put him through an avionics degree and introduced him to a cross section of Pakistani society – “urban and rural, posh and poor, a wide range of ethnicities” – the only problem being that he proved unable to fly a plane. “I was really good at takeoffs but you have to be able to land a plane safely, too. Especially in jets you have to do things really fast, and I like to think about things,” he says.After it became clear that his heart wasn’t in military service, he was released 10 years early into a civilian life of “small-time politicians, businessmen and struggling gangsters. Every second friend of mine was a drug addict.” One of them was freelancing for a magazine, and when he was too strung-out to deliver, Hanif would help him out. He went on to join the political magazine Newsline, where he met the editor whom he credits with turning him from a hack into a writer. Razia Bhatti, he says, “taught me the value of a good sentence and that it wasn’t just about having a scandalous story”. On one occasion she also saved his neck, refusing to give his address to police who called at her home at 2am looking for the reporter who had been rude about a local politician. His tribute to her was to smuggle her name into the title of his second novel, Our Lady of Alice Bhatti, published in 2011.But midnight arrests were not the only danger in Karachi at the time. “People were being kidnapped for a few thousand rupees … Carjacking was rampant,” he would later recall. So in 1996, recently married to the actor Nimra Bucha, he accepted a job at the BBC, working for its Urdu-language service in London. “We thought we’d stay two years and that turned into five and then into 10, and we had a mortgage and a child...”While Bucha ran a cafe in south London and worked as an actor, Hanif moonlighted on a novel. “But with my job and then my son it was start-stop,” he says, so he decided to take a break. He signed up for an MA at the University of East Anglia. Twice a week he’d commute from London to Norwich, “and I suddenly realised that there was no shame in being a struggling writer. I stopped being shy and secretive about it.”When Pakistani publishers proved reluctant to take on A Case of Exploding Mangoes, with its send-up of an obsessively superstitious military dictator infected with anal worms, he sold it to Random House India, which planned to export a few copies over the border. But it soon became clear that the book had a wider appeal. It won a Commonwealth first novel prize, was called in by the judges of the 2008 Booker prize and shortlisted for the  first book award. Hanif had by then risen to become head of the BBC’s Urdu Service – “an exciting middle-management job, but I didn’t think I was very good at managing people”. With their son approaching high-school age, the family decided to move back to Karachi in 2008, where they found friends awaiting their arrival with trepidation. “A lot of them said: ‘What have you done?’ But I was pretty sure they were being alarmist. People in the Pakistan army don’t read books and particularly not novels.”Undeterred by his friends’ misgivings, Hanif picked up his old life as a media firebrand, writing in Urdu and English, and driving around the city with just his dog for protection at a time when many were afraid to go out without guns and bodyguards. “I knew if I went out at night with my dog, no terrorist or police or robber was going to come near me,” he says. In homage to one such canine companion, he created Mutt, the brain-fried mongrel who narrates a strand of Red Birds.In 2013, he raised the temperature by collecting testimony about enforced disappearances in the province of Balochistan in a short book, The Baloch Who Is Not Missing Anymore and Others Who Are, published by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. “I had a few minor threats – a call to my brother asking what was wrong with me, and one from an old air force colleague warning me to be careful,” he says. Two years later things turned nasty, when an event on the disappeared at “a big posh university in Lahore” was abruptly cancelled after warnings from the intelligence service. A friend, Sabeen Mahmud, decided to stage the event at her small cafe bookshop in Karachi.“There was fear in the back of our heads. I told her that emotions were running high and why didn’t she delay for a few days, but she always said: ‘Fear is a line in your head. You have to cross it,’” says Hanif. He was unable to attend as he was filming 900 miles away in Islamabad, so followed proceedings on Twitter from his hotel room. “When it had finished, I was so relieved,” he recalls. He set off to collect his car, “and by the time I got down to the car park I had got the message”. Mahmud had been shot at close range as she drove away from the event and had died instantly. “I don’t think I or any of my colleagues have recovered from that shot,” he says.Under pressure from family and friends, he has since stopped making television appearances and confines his political commentary largely to US media. “We’re now in the situation that if you want to write about politics you have to write about it abroad, but it’s important that sometimes people are writing about it in Pakistan as well. I used to be able to do that and editors would print it and risk their necks, but they are already in so much trouble.”On the positive side, A Case of Exploding Mangoes is finally set to be published in Urdu next year, while America’s Pittsburgh Opera will premiere an opera about Pakistan’s Bhutto dynasty – his second collaboration with the Arab-American composer Mohammed Fairouz.Red Birds is itself like a highly charged political chamber opera, whose toughest truth lies in a duet between the US airman and a field researcher in “the parallel universe called International Relief”. As Major Ellie devastatingly puts it: “If I didn’t bomb some place, how would she save that place? If I didn’t rain fire from the skies, who would need her to douse that fire on the ground? Why would you need somebody to throw blankets on burning babies if there were no burning babies? … You need fireworks to ignite human imagination.”• Mohammed Hanif’s Red Birds is published by Bloomsbury.

The French president spoke for the European Union as a whole when he called for the UK to find a solution to the impasse of the Brexit talks at the European council in Brussels. “There is no additional political compromise to be made on the European side as now,” he said.When it comes down to Brexit, Macron has always been blunt. “Those who claim it is easy to operate outside of the European Union are liars,” he declared back in September at the fateful Salzburg summit. Furious Brexiteers advised Macron to “butt out” of British politics – but in doing so, they were only shooting the messenger. The French president, regularly attacked by UK politicians and pundits for daring to criticise Brexit, rarely speaks his own mind on the subject – he merely repeats, if in quite a direct phrasing, the EU’s line. Truth, it would seem, hurts more with a French accent.Macron started off this week’s European council with a show of goodwill. At the opening of the summit in Brussels, on Wednesday, Macron said he wanted to send a “message of trust, and of urgency”. “Progress has been made, but we’re not there yet. We must decide now,” he said, adding that he hoped Theresa May would explain “what is possible” to unblock the deadlocked talks.But little happened, and May’s presentation to the EU27 was deemed underwhelming – relaxed in tone yet devoid of new content. At a press conference yesterday, Macron made clear that the EU had done its best to find a deal and would continue to do so, but that deep down, it was up to the UK to make a choice.There is fatigue on the EU’s side of the negotiations. Since 2016, the European red lines have not moved an inch: there can be no cherry picking of the single market’s four freedoms of people, capital, services and goods there cannot be a hard border in Ireland. “The EU has already shown efficacy and flexibility,” Macron said at the European council. “We do not want a deal that would undermine the integrity of the single market, or the four freedoms, or that would be damaging to Ireland.” He was only repeating what the EU made clear on day one of the Brexit process.But day one is long gone. It is now Macron’s message of “urgency” that must find its way across the Channel. He stressed the UK’s responsibility in the current deadlock: “It is up to the United Kingdom to offer a solution that fits these demands … The key element is a British political compromise.”At the Brussels summit, everyone on the EU’s side was briefing a similar shtick: the ball is now in May’s court. Keeping to the European position almost word for word, Macron was more well-behaved than fellow leaders, such as Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaitė, who did not mince her words when she declared that the UK “does not know what it wants”. The EU’s collective frustration is clear – it isn’t just Macron’s.Firmness can work in his favour at home. Not everyone in France is a fan of his shiny brand of neoliberalism, but most French people can get behind his Brexit stance. France rarely discusses Brexit (shockingly, other nations have moved on), and is reminded of the UK’s nightmarish political situation only when Macron attends a EU summit and makes that kind of speech – one that makes a leader look strong. The French will agree that ultimately, it is the Brits’ problem. After a months-long scandal involving Macron’s bodyguard, and with three of his ministers resigning in quick succession, the president will take the small victories he can get.With a no-deal scenario getting more likely by the day, EU leaders cannot afford to leave things to chance. The French and German governments have published draft contingency plans.“We have prepared ourselves, and we have taken steps,” Macron said at the EU summit. “In a very methodical manner, everything is prepared in case of a deal or a no deal.” He concluded: “I do prefer a deal, but I would never favour a bad deal.”Dear United Kingdom, please don’t screw this up.Sincerely, Emmanuel Macron, speaking for the EU27, who are worried, but tired of staging intervention after intervention.• Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Britain.

It’s far past time for a fundamental break in the relationship. The United States must view the Saudis not as flawed partners, but rather as malign actors undermining US interests.Khashoggi’s presumed murder in Turkey – where he disappeared after entering a Saudi consulate – has shocked the world. But no one should have been surprised. Saudi Arabia is a monarchy that rules through repression. Freedom House ranked Saudi Arabia as “not free” in 2018, while the 2017 US Human Rights report on Saudi Arabia detailed abuses by government including, “unlawful killings, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention,violence and official gender discrimination against women”.And yet, specious arguments for a robust US-Saudi partnership have dominated policy circles and government. We need Saudi Arabia to combat terrorism, we are told. Mere whispers of the words “but, terrorism cooperation” have long won debates in Washington over the need to work with the Saudis. But is Saudi Arabia a real partner? Fifteen of the 19 men who attacked America on 911 were Saudis. And according to a leaked US government memo from 2009, “donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide”.Another argument claims the United States needs Saudi Arabia for regional stability. But the facts tell a different story. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia has been waging a war – with US support – for more than three years, causing one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. With thousands of Yemenis dead and millions displaced, the United Nations is now warning that up to 13 million Yemenis are at risk of starvation. And while Iran is also to blame for backing violence in Yemen, Saudi Arabia has escalated significantly.Ah, yes, Iran! Combatting Iran’s malign influence is another magic end that supposedly justifies the means of the United States working with Saudi Arabia. But what has the relationship achieved for the United States? Saudi Arabia tried to prevent the United States from negotiating a deal that verifiably stopped Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon, and then encouraged the Trump administration to withdraw despite the fact that the deal was working. Iran is no doubt a destabilizing actor, funding terrorism and threatening Israel. But Saudi Arabia is also a destabilizing actor, and by taking Saudi Arabia’s side against Iran it is entirely possible that the United States helps fuel the deadly regional rivalry.One more recent justification for the US-Saudi relationship has been Israel. With the quietly growing ties between Israel and Gulf states, Saudi Arabia no longer plays a lead role in condemning Israel. And while lower tensions between Israel and its neighbors is a good thing, their improving relationship is not about the United States – it’s about increasingly shared anti-Iran views. The United States can continue to support Israel’s security without supporting Saudi Arabia.But don’t we need Saudi Arabia for oil? Not as much as we once did. And Saudi Arabia has its own interest in continuing to pump oil, which is the country’s sole stream of revenue. Furthermore, the world must rapidly transition to clean energy to avert the most cataclysmic effects of climate change, so this can help provide a kickstart.Which brings us back to Khashoggi. The fate of one man illustrates how destructive the US-Saudi relationship has become. It is now widely believed that Saudi Arabia felt emboldened enough to kill a US resident with impunity in another country. And Trump’s response? Help the Saudis cover up the reported murder.Trump has given Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) a blank check in the Middle East. The result has been an emboldened Saudi Arabia, which under MBS’s leadership reportedly kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and downgraded the Canada-Saudi Arabia relationship over Canadian criticism of Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses. Trump has supported MBS’s dangerous policies, from the blockade of Qatar to the devastating war in Yemen. Trump even refused to back America’s ally Canada in its dispute with Saudi Arabia. The reported murder of Khashoggi is a byproduct of this morally bankrupt relationship. Khashoggi’s blood is also on Trump’s hands.Why would Trump assist Saudi Arabia in policies so damaging to US interests? Perhaps it is because of Trump’s blatant disregard for human rights at home and abroad. Or perhaps it is because of longstanding personal financial ties between Trump and Saudi Arabia, including a massive jump in Saudi patronage of Trump hotels since Trump became president. With reports that the Trump administration may have known in advance of an alleged Saudi plot against Khashoggi and did nothing to warn him, we need answers as to what the Trump administration knew and when they knew it.The US-Saudi relationship as we know it is over, and Khashoggi’s apparent murder is helping wake everyone up to a relationship that soured long ago. It’s time to finally ground any engagement with Saudi Arabia solely on genuine US interests in regional peace and human rights. That means no more arms sales. No more taking sides in a regional war between fundamentalist, repressive regimes. No more support for the war in Yemen. US officials should trigger the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to impose sanctions on MBS and Saudi leadership for human rights violations. And when we need cooperation on counter-terrorism, be transactional – and sanction Saudi officials if they don’t target terrorist funding coming from within their country.At the end of the day, this is about more than the US-Saudi relationship. It’s about whether or not America will stand up for democratic values and human rights, including against the growing brazenness of autocracies like Russia and China to reach beyond their borders to murder and abduct critics. The United States must take a stand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc5bc13d34a59906a9abd449ed995fcc98cf046/166_300_2834_1700/master/2834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5247497389663d6dea6c4c1046f75ca","title":"nick clegg facebook politics tech","story":"Next week it will be my first day in a new job, after almost 20 years in public life in Europe and Britain. It could not be more of a contrast. Instead of the gothic splendour of Westminster, I will be surrounded by the gleaming glass and steel of Silicon Valley. Instead of the clout of the state in Whitehall, I will now experience the dynamism of the private sector in Palo Alto. Instead of the impact of Brexit, I will now be focused on the impact of tech.A job at Facebook is – literally and metaphorically – a long way from SW1. I have mixed feelings about leaving the UK’s public debate about the future of our country’s relations with the rest of Europe. Since the referendum, I have devoted my energies to making the case – often in uncompromising terms unavailable to those still in office – for a rethink of what I believe may turn out to be the greatest act of self-harm committed by a mature democracy. It is being made against the interests and wishes of those who have to bear the heaviest consequences: the young.The Brexit drama will soon move to – and possibly culminate in – the place where it arguably belonged all along, parliament. I am no longer a member of parliament and have never had any desire to sit in an unreformed House of Lords. So once I had decided to accept a new role at Facebook, there was little merit in delaying my move any longer.It is, of course, deeply distressing to see the UK become marginalised in world affairs, distracted by the grinding Brexit psychodrama at Westminster.

It is unthinkable that statesmen and stateswomen of the past would have placed our country in such a weak position.So I sincerely hope, when they finally come to pass judgment, MPs will put the long-term fortunes of our nation before the short-term prospects of their party. The case for a people’s vote on any final deal is overwhelming. But I will no longer seek to play a public role in that debate myself.Even though Nick Clegg spent five years as deputy prime minister, his probable political highlight came about a month before he took the post, in the unlikely arena of the pre-election party leaders’ debate of April 2016.Pitted against David Cameron and Gordon Brown, the then 43-year-old Liberal Democrat leader showed himself telegenic, engaging and politely baffled at his opponents’ tribal enmity. Not only did the audience polling declare him the winner, the debate also sparked the catchphrase: “I agree with Nick”.It’s perhaps unfair to say things only went downhill from then. After the election, the Lib Dems had 57 MPs – enough to gain a share in government with Cameron’s Conservatives and get Clegg an office adjoining Downing Street.But, inevitably, with a minority share in power came compromises, most notably ditching the party’s pre-election promises on tuition fees, as well as a tacit approval of the government’s austerity programme.Clegg was never as politically popular again. In the 2015 election, the Lib Dems were decimated to a rump of eight and out of power. Two years later, Clegg lost his Sheffield Hallam seat to Jared O’Mara of Labour, a party which had never held the constituency since it was created in the 1860s.It was a rapid fall for a man who ended up spending just 12 years in the Commons, becoming Lib Dem leader little more than two years after becoming an MP, following his work at the European commission and five years as an MEP.Since leaving parliament, Clegg has doubled up as a Lib Dem grandee and a leading voice opposing Brexit, which has seen him lead unofficial and controversial diplomatic efforts to try to stop the process.His political fortunes were placed into some context after it emerged last year that Clegg’s eldest son, Antonio, then 15, had been diagnosed with the cancer Hodgkin lymphoma. He responded successfully to treatment.Instead, as vice-president of global affairs and communications at Facebook, I hope to help it navigate the numerous challenges it faces, in common with other leading tech companies, as the data-driven technological revolution continues to affect every aspect of our everyday lives: the control we have over our personal data the integrity of our democratic process the power and concerns about artificial intelligence the tension between the global internet and national jurisdictions the balance between free speech and prohibited content and the wellbeing of our children.I do not arrive in Silicon Valley with a monopoly of wisdom on these crucial questions, but I have been impressed in my numerous conversations with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in recent months by the seriousness with which they recognise the profound responsibilities that Facebook has – not only to its vast number of users but to society at large.As with most big decisions I took in politics, I expect my decision to move to Silicon Valley will be shouted down by people from the left and the right. As concerns about the impact of technology grow, the left has tended to condemn “big tech” as representative of everything that is wrong in an unleashed market economy. The right regards it as a threat to traditional family values. Some criticisms – especially the tech world’s libertarian indifference to the wider responsibility of governments and regulators in its early days – are fair. Others are wide of the mark.But, as a general rule, I believe in engaging and grappling with difficult questions. If Silicon Valley were to disappear overnight, the technology invented in it would not. Global tech leadership would instantly transfer from the west coast of the US to China. We cannot wish away technological progress. Nor can we simply bemoan the social, ethical and political dilemmas raised by the tech revolution. Every major technological breakthrough in human history has created challenges as well as opportunities. We need to find solutions, not succumb to the easy emotions and polemic of a “tech-lash”.I remain a stubborn optimist about the progressive potential to society of technological innovation. It can transform how we work, play and build relationships. It can help to protect our environment and keep our streets safe. It will fundamentally change how we teach our children at school and at home. It is transforming healthcare and transport. If the tech industry can work sensibly with governments, regulators, parliaments and civic society around the world, I believe we can enhance the benefits of technology while diminishing the often unintended downsides.The worlds of politics and tech too often speak past each other. The temptation for one side to condemn or ignore the other is great. But this standoff will, in the end, leave everyone worse off. It is time to build bridges between politics and tech so that tech can become the servant of progress and optimism, not a source of fear and suspicion.•Nick Clegg is a former UK deputy prime minister and former leader of the Liberal Democrats"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd412f66db8e83e8056defc7882731bd220ee199/0_22_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cc2fb91176a8cbbf4b2fc4449e1cc49","title":"peoples vote march eu referendum brexit","story":"Saturday’s march in London shows that progressives still refuse to listen to those who pressed the Brexit buttonSome of my best friends will be marching for a people’s vote on Saturday. Some of them are the type who don’t normally go on marches, but they feel strongly and they want to make their voices heard. I won’t be joining them. Not because I don’t care about their feelings or voices, but because of the strange denial of what this is all about.Remainers would like a second referendum where all the deluded leavers suddenly see the light. They see themselves as wholly on the side of good. They want collaboration and cheap flights, good cheese and Spanish carers. They want to safeguard scientific research and human rights. Sure, I want those things too.Brexit, as it is being played out, is a disaster, boring beyond words and full of words that mean zilch. The dreadful feeling is that it will all go on for ever. Are we going to be Canada or Norway? No, we are going to be England. Does May know what she is doing? The friendless, sleepless leader ploughs on. The Labour party, meanwhile, has absented itself, mainly with an eye on its many leave-voting seats. Principles are traded like derivatives. Who knows what a Labour Brexit would look like?But really this is all about feelings – and I wonder why politicos are so bad at even beginning to understand this. Two years on, it is all, as Danny Dyer said, “a mad riddle”. Progressives still prefer to bully leavers rather than understand what drives them. Despising half the country is now the progressive position. So half the country are racist, old, small-minded, poor people who were seduced by a combination of Aaron Banks and delusions of empire. What these people really need is to be lectured constantly by a motley crew of metropolitan celebrities and has-been politicians (Clegg, Heseltine, Blair). Spare me, please.Maybe these people are supremely persuasive. But the reality is not – as is so often claimed – that leave voters regret their vote (some do, but not many). They mostly just wish it was over. Me too. I wish it was over.At one level, it is a disaster for progressives – and part of that is the refusal to see the Brexit vote as a revolution. It was, but just not the one we thought was coming. There was a massive turnout, and it was close. The simplistic idea that really people didn’t understand anything at all and were just very angry about austerity and neoliberalism is just that. Remove the agency of half the people, why don’t you? Sticking two fingers up to the establishment in an irrational and possibly self-harming way remains an analysis that no one wants to deal with. I see why. Self-harm is a form of agency when all else fails – but it is hard to watch.All the portents of that vote were there – and if you want to change things, you need to understand them. The remain tactic was to dismiss leave as irrational, and it still is. Understanding the power of the irrational is not the forte of political analysts.We are all familiar with the economic arguments and yet the earthquake of leave turned on its head the mantra that everyone votes out of economic interest. Something deeper and darker is going on. Identity matters, belonging matters. If the left don’t address these issues, the right owns them. Brexit was an act of transgression in terms of the articles of faith of liberal democracy – and it is this transgression that we need to address.A few thinkers recognise this, and a great collection of writings from Compass, The Causes of Brexit and the Cures, brings together Caroline Lucas, Lisa Nandy and John Harris among others to try and unpick what is happening. For all those marching on Saturday – marching because you are so sure in your hearts that you are on the side of good – can you not for one minute examine your own hearts and ask yourselves why half the country doesn’t share your cultural capital? Why Arts Council England spends £8 in Islington for every £1 it spends in the former coalfields? Why, as Neal Lawson puts it, so many people hit “the panic button”? Are you so convinced that we want another vote? Is this not a huge loss of faith in democracy? I myself sometimes waver – but I see a second referendum as undoable, expensive and part of a strange denial by the great and the good. And in the end, I don’t want to be told what to do by those who could not see it coming. Why am I to trust them? Because, yes, this is about hearts not just heads, as even the redoubtable Timothy Garton-Ash tells us today. Yet we don’t want to talk about the visceral. Everything must be subsumed to reason even when reason has been shown not to work. Often I think of an interview Mark Rylance did about the success of Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, long before Brexit. He spoke of the play “satisfying a hunger in audiences for wildness and defiance. There’s a feeling that they’ve eaten something they haven’t eaten for years – something they’d forgotten, that’s really needed for their health.”What was that thing? Nasty nationalism, a sense of agency, a revolt? Has that thing gone away, or will it be played by the likes of Steve Bannon? For while we dawdle in technocratic limbo, that thing remains and it will not be overcome by the rehearsal of numbers. Brexit is happening. The people voted. They were the wrong people.But raise your voices on Saturday. I will listen to your anger as you say no one voted for this. For the reason we are in this mess is a basic refusal to listen. And learn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb9117397e8153349364f0fc3ebf00ead14e29c/0_192_1668_1000/master/1668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12adac3d23b69f1967f97fb499ead05c","title":"the guardian view on theresa mays brexit march to stop the madness","story":"If ever there was a reason for the people of Britain to take to the streets to protest about the reckless hazarding of our country’s interests, the Conservative government’s Brexit failure during the past two years provides one. If ever there was a moment to insist, through a peaceful display of outrage, that Britain can do so much better by following a different course, this is it. And if ever there was a chance for the voices that Theresa May’s government has consistently snubbed and ignored to shift the agenda of the Brexit debate away from the fantasies of the fanatical few towards the practical priorities of the ordinary many, then Saturday’s People’s Vote March for the Future provides that opportunity.Brexit is by any measure the most important change of strategic direction that this country has faced in more than 70 years. The people voted for it. But they did not vote for the terms of separation. Those remained to be negotiated, debated and agreed. The outcome of those negotiations with our European Union neighbours will shape the job prospects and life chances of anxious millions of Britons today and of future generations too. The terms on which the agreement is implemented will be pivotal to Britain’s – and Europe’s – shared ability, in a world where the rules-based order is increasingly under challenge, to deal with international problems ranging from banking stability and climate change to terrorism. The deal will also shape whether the United Kingdom – another union in which, as with the EU, our peoples have been better off together than apart – holds together or breaks into less consequential parts.From almost the very moment that the referendum result was declared, the handling of Brexit has been a story of unremitting and nationally humiliating failure. The negotiations were said to be simple. But they weren’t. The EU would bend over backwards, it was said, to give Britain special favours. It wouldn’t. Other nations would beat a path to Britain’s door to strike trade deals. They didn’t. Under Theresa May, the Tory party would bring the nation back together after the referendum. That didn’t happen either, because Mrs May and the Tory party didn’t even try instead they split ever more deeply. Not only has the government failed to strike a deal with the EU. It has even failed to reach a coherent agreement with its own MPs. As a result, Brexit threatens to be both a policy failure without precedent and a national betrayal whose reverberations will send tremors down the decades.This was supposed to have been the week in which the government finally struck a deal with the European Union. Whether you support or oppose Britain’s departure from the EU – and this newspaper still opposes it – a deal would be a turning point for Britain. It might – possibly – have been the time when some of the country’s post-Brexit economic and security needs could have been agreed. It might – potentially – have allowed the long process of healing some of the Brexit isions to begin. Instead, in Brussels this week, the moment simply came and went, with Mrs May’s government powerless to sign up.This is not just another unfortunate slippage of a timetable. It is yet another unavoidable collision between Brexit fantasy and Brexit reality. Yet this one risks, now more than ever before, a completely unacceptable sacrifice of the national interest to the interests of the Tory party, in the form of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. From the start, Mrs May has told the Tory party that she could deliver a form of Brexit that was simply not achievable. Nearly half of the country did not want this in the first place. Many more have become alarmed at the chaos and incompetence with which it has been pursued.The coming weeks will decide if Britain and the EU can forge a Brexit relationship that works for their peoples or not. Huge choices have to be made in parliament by MPs, perhaps including a second vote on the terms of any deal. All this is on the table. But the journey ahead requires leadership that neither main party has yet offered on an issue of such historic importance. Saturday is a day to bear witness to the urgent truth that Britain must have a far better future relationship with the rest of Europe than anything that Mrs May has come close to providing."},{"url":null,"title":"trevor noah stephen colbert jamal khashoggi voter suppression","story":"Late-night hosts discussed Trump’s latest remarks on the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and attempts to suppress voters before the midtermsLate-night hosts covered Donald Trump’s latest refusal to attack the Saudis for their alleged involvement in the presumed death of Jamal Khashoggi and discussed voter suppression in Georgia.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed reported attempts by the Republicans to suppress voters. “This year every single vote counts but there are a few states that are working to change that,” he said.He continued: “It’s like being a contestant on Jeopardy and instead of trying to win by being the smartest person, you just spend all your time tasing your competition.”Noah moved on to the hotly contested race in Georgia between Stacey Abrams, who could be the first black female governor in the US and Brian Kemp, who could be “the first white governor named Brian Kemp in Georgia, I think”.The latest ruling insists that the name on a person’s driver’s license must be exactly the same as their real name with the slightest mistake meaning that someone won’t be able to vote. “It’s funny how this happens with voting but it never stops the IRS,” Noah said.The majority of people affected by the ruling are black. “Well, well, well, my old friend racism, I’ve been expecting you,” he joked.Noah continued: “Isn’t it interesting how every time Republicans create a voting restriction, it just so happens to disproportionately affect people of the brown brown?”He expressed frustration at another attempt to stop people of colour from voting. “You don’t have to say who you’re targeting to target someone, you just have to say which rules are likely to hit them most,” he said. “Like, if I was trying to block white people at the voting booth, I wouldn’t need to say ‘No white people are allowed’, I’d just be like ‘Sorry, no pumpkin spice lattes in the voting booth.’”Noah explained that Kemp is also secretary of state in Georgia so essentially controls the regulations that affect this year’s vote. “That is some Africa-level shit right there,” he said.Noah’s idea is that “every black person in America needs to register as a Republican” so they will be allowed to vote. “They will make sure every vote counts,” he said. “They’re going to be waving Trayvons into the voting booth like a third base coach.”On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert started with news that special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s alleged ties to Russia will be released after the midterms. “Enough waiting,” he said. “Mueller’s been teasing us for so long at this point, even Sting is like, ‘Just finish already.’”Trump continues to choose financial ties to Saudi Arabia over criticising them for their alleged involvement in the disappearance of Khashoggi leading some to claim he is showing an uncharacteristic amount of caution. “Yes, an uncharacteristic amount,” he said. “In other words: any.”While speaking to the press, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, referred to Khashoggi’s alleged death as an incident. “Just like the Hitchcock movie Dial M for Incident,” Colbert quipped.Turkish reports have said the alleged killing was carried out by a squad of 15 Saudis, one of whom has since mysteriously died in a car accident. “Right now in Riyadh, there are 14 other guys saying, ‘It’s a nice day, I think I’m gonna walk,’” he said.Televangelist Pat Robertson was on television this week to defend Trump’s decision to choose the importance of an arms deal with Saudi Arabia over the life of one journalist. “Thank you Reverend for capturing the core message of Christianity: how important can one man’s death be?” he joked.There was also a report that the chief of staff, John Kelly, and national security adviser, John Bolton, has a profanity-laced argument outside the Oval Office. “Well, it’s good they didn’t do it inside the Oval Office,” he said. “That is reserved for the sacred presidential duty of tweeting about porn stars being horsefaces.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24c553aaf27a5edf512eae8b0c19890fee4d7be7/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436a6ccba0d7e2430603ce0f5d02f213","title":"scottishpower to invest in solar energy for the first time","story":"Big six firm to focus exclusively on renewables, adding solar power to its windfarmsScottish Power, one of Britain’s biggest energy companies, has said it will invest in solar power for the first time as part of its move away from fossil fuels.The big six firm sold off its last gas-fired power stations to Drax Group this week to focus exclusively on renewables, which today consists of onshore and offshore windfarms.But Keith Anderson, the company’s chief executive, told the  he had decided to move into solar, too.“The solar market has had difficulties over the last wee while. But you look at where the technology cost is getting to, and the possibilities of integrating it with wind … how it balances from season to season wind and solar output, and we see a good opportunity there for further investment.”Solar farms around the UK have historically been built by smaller energy firms and community groups, so the entrance of such a big player would mark a major shake-up. It could also inject life into a sector that has stalled in the face of subsidy cuts.Researchers have argued that the comparatively low wind output across Europe this summer because of hot, still weather was a reminder of why energy companies should be investing in solar as well as wind.“We need to invest in the cheapest forms of energy – that’s onshore wind, offshore wind, it’s going to be solar – and that will help drive down the cost of energy,” he said.The world’s need to tackle climate change also made it clear that companies needed to embrace green energy wholeheartedly, he said.“Look at the IPCC report last week. My absolute belief is that organisations need to be at the forefront of that change. We can’t be part of the problem, we have to be part of the solution.”Scottish Power would be competing in an auction next summer for a slice of £557m in government subsidies for offshore windfarms, Anderson confirmed.The firm hopes to secure a contract for its planned 1,200MW East Anglia Three project, which would be capable of powering nearly 900,000 homes and dwarf the world’s current biggest, a 659MW scheme off the Cumbrian coast.Anderson also expressed confidence that ministers were nearing a rethink on their block on subsidies for onshore windfarms, which the Conservatives barred when they came to power in 2015. “We’re closer than we’ve ever been before,” he said.A poll this week found that two thirds of people living in rural Scottish communities, which are considered to have some of the best sites for prospective sites, support onshore windfarms.But the prospect for new gas power stations – which companies including Drax and Germany’s RWE want to build – were bleak, Anderson said.“Right now the commercial signals don’t exist to build a new gas plant in the UK. That might change in the future, but it’s not something we’ll get involved in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18df1b107396e82d489d3fb24eaeee16790026d/0_212_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5445f0930b79c23181e2a9e98bcd62","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A 1,000-metre spider web and a hellbender devouring a snake are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4a75435365a2a2300e29973d18af91b9f8795b/0_172_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42d2de12816b44309e4f814613f2b42","title":"javier bardem woody allen defence","story":"The Spanish actor has spoken in defence of the director, calling him a ‘genius’ with whom he’d work again immediatelyJavier Bardem has spoken out in support of Woody Allen, who directed him and his wife Penélope Cruz in the 2008 comedy Vicky Cristina Barcelona.Bardem’s comments emerged from a masterclass at the Lumiere festival in Lyon, France. The Spanish actor, who also appeared in the 007 film Skyfall and won an Oscar for best supporting actor for the Coen brothers’ No Country for Old Men, said he would be happy to work for Allen again.“At the time I did Vicky Cristina Barcelona, the allegations were already well known for more than 10 years, and two states in the US deemed he was not guilty.”He added: “If the legal situation ever changes, then I’d change my mind. But for now I don’t agree with the public lynching that he’s been receiving, and if Woody Allen called me to work with him again I’d be there tomorrow morning. He’s a genius.”Bardem’s attitude contrasts strongly with a number of high-profile actors, including Colin Firth, Greta Gerwig, and Timothée Chalamet, who have said they regret working with Allen and won’t do so again, following a newspaper article in 2013 by Allen’s daughter Dylan Farrow in which she repeated accusations of child sexual abuse by her father, alleged to have taken place in 1992. Allen denies all the allegations. An investigation by the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut concluded in 1993 that no abuse had taken place, and New York state’s Department of Social Services cleared Allen later the same year following a child welfare investigation.Allen, meanwhile, has said that he intends to keep working despite the hostility of large sections of the film industry. Page Six, the New York Post’s gossip section, reported Allen as saying: “I’m a writer. It’s what I am. What I do. What I always will be. I’ll write. Since I continually have ideas it’ll be new ideas and I’ll write new things.”Allen’s most recent film, A Rainy Day in New York, has yet to secure a release date."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb714834db18244ef43d9238bfe6e152eea7191/0_170_1764_1058/master/1764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e3c2da67c919db8dfa508a515df3c4","title":"tell us how does it feel to watch a classic film on first release","story":"As audio of frenzied audience reactions to the original Halloween has gone viral, we want to hear your stories of seeing defining films at the cinemaThe much-hyped release of the latest Halloween installment (tipped to break records with a $70m opening) has led many to think back to the film that started it all back in 1978.While there have been rankings aplenty, there’s also been a rather fascinating video going viral that gives us an idea of what it would have been like to see the original on the big screen.

I had bought a copy at my local Waterstones while I was still working at the fire brigade. It jumped out at me. At the time, cookbooks were glossy, beautiful, aspirational, whereas this was: “Look, you can do this in half an hour or less, what are you waiting for?” And I thought, “All right, I’ll give it a go.”I’ve riffed off his recipes so often. All the pastas, the quick pizza doughs, the mushroom risotto, tomato soup, the curries. I’d flick through the book, knocking out ingredients I didn’t have and changing them to fit whatever I could afford at the time. It is a comforting classic.The puttanesca recipe is still one of my favourites. When I first read it, I’d never heard of the dish before. Jamie uses fresh tomatoes, anchovies and capers, but I thought, I can make that with tinned stuff. I put it all together and it was amazing it didn’t taste like I was eating “poor person food”. There’s such a stigma around what people in dire financial circumstances can eat. And really it was just a tin of tomatoes, a tin of fish, some lemon juice, salt and pepper. But it tasted like actual great food. It’s cropped up again and again in my own books, in various guises.All Jamie’s early stuff was cheeky but encouraging. It’s how I try to communicate with my readers now: simple, chatty, bish bash bosh, come-into-my-kitchen banter. And you can’t take away from what an impact that had on people’s cooking. It was revolutionary. I don’t know if it’s because he started out in a pub, or that he’s worked in kitchens, or that he is also raising a family, but he meets it from every possible angle.His recipes are brilliant. I’ve never made one that hasn’t worked. He’s not prescriptive or obsessive. To be sure, he loves what he loves, and always places a great emphasis on good-quality ingredients, but there’s no condescending undertone that if you don’t have this ingredient, you can’t make this great recipe. And that instils great confidence in a cook. There’s real skill in being able to give people both a set of instructions and the freedom to do whatever they want.Confidence is important. Lots of people don’t cook because they’re scared to. What I loved about Jamie Oliver’s early work was his little kitchen, the simplicity of it all. His execution might have sometimes been a little clumsy, but his basic message of cooking what you can with what you’ve got is a good one.If I did meet him, I would love to just cook for half a day with him and see what nuggets of wisdom I could pick up. And I’d also want just to say thank you. His work has had a real impact on me. Even now, if I’m stuck for a recipe or an ingredient, I’ll go on his website and have a little poke around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9775735c7ac2d87978d80f575de5745b60a2057/0_70_3325_1995/master/3325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a05d3e6c86f14f72df91cb31f3372a42","title":"a steadfast commitment to entertain","story":"Sign up now!

But it soon became clear that Bayern are concerned not so much about their own difficulties but about what forthright criticism of their players is doing to the overall tone of football discourse.Rummenigge began by quoting from Article 1 of the German constitution: “Human dignity is unimpeachable,” he lectured, complaining that some observers have been too “degrading” in their assessment of certain players, adding that language should be “respectful” and iniduals should not be singled out in a team sport. “Today is an important day as we inform you that we will no longer tolerate this derogatory and derisive reporting,” continued Rummenigge.“It is truly fitting to mark Joe Hart’s outstanding contribution to Manchester City in such a visible way” – Man City chief suit Khaldoon al-Mubarak dedicates a training pitch to their former keeper, who became invisible as soon as Pep turned up.Football Weekly Extra is in the building.“I don’t think that Emmanuel Dairo (Fiver letter yesterday) is as clever as he pretends.

The vulnerable succumbed. Those who were resistant grew stronger. Meanwhile the plague remained the same, stuck in its old plague ways, scowling on the periphery, reduced to the odd destructive burst.There are of course many points of difference between José Mourinho’s approach to winning at football and the bubonic plague. But like the great plague Mourinho’s voracious early success has been followed by a period of dying back like the plague Mourinho is still basically doing the same thing and like the plague the high Mourinho style seems, at times, to have simply run out of people to kill.Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off against Chelsea already looks like the start of a run of games that will define Mourinho’s fretful third season at Manchester United. That is no surprise. It is Mourinho’s destiny to find his life measured out in trips to Stamford Bridge, those clanky blue stands the framing against which his managerial evolution has been marked: from the golden years of Bubonic José, the slick young coach with the physically dominant attacking style to the strangulating triumphs and angry departures a decade later.And so to this weekend, when Mourinho will return to face a manager who is similar in one way and utterly different in so many others. In August Mourinho revealed he had never met Maurizio Sarri, let alone fielded a team against him. Sarri is four years older, with 12 years less on the clock as a top‑tier coach. He is, from one angle, a kind of Bizarro José, another Chelsea manager who never played professionally, the banker versus the translator.At which point the similarities run dry. Mourinho served a privileged apprenticeship at Barcelona. Sarri grafted part-time in amateur football. Mourinho is obsessed with presentation and show. Sarri wanders around the Stamford Bridge touchline wearing dad-glasses and an ill-fitting nylon smock-shirt that makes him look like an overworked military field surgeon on a fag break between yanking out shrapnel and swapping wisecracks.Tactically Mourinho’s first instinct is to constrict, to disrupt his opponents’ strengths before asserting his own whereas Sarri still comes across like a fan with a tactics board, a man drawn to the flame, bent above all on enacting his own vision of high-energy attacking football.Events have transformed this first meeting into an occasion of unusual October urgency, on one side at least. It is a fixture Mourinho really could do with winning, and for reasons that go beyond the usual bruised and resentful one‑upmanship towards his successors in the Stamford Bridge dugout.Reports have suggested Mourinho spent the international break working furiously on preparations for United’s next run of fixtures. On Tuesday morning he could be seen arriving at Carrington before the sun had risen, eyes gleaming with manic intent through the gloom of his club saloon.And before a ball is kicked the most obvious conclusion is that Sarri’s style looks, at first glance, to be made for Mourinho. The pattern has been clear. Central midfield controls the ball: nobody comes close to Jorginho’s 853 Premier League passes this season, most of them urgent little sideways shuttles. In between “resting the ball” Chelsea’s attacks come in swift, short-passing waves with the whole team shifting upfield. David Luiz is vital to this, never happier than when encouraged to gambol about the pitch with his head in the air, ears flapping, like a prize terrier with a surgical cone on its neck haring the wrong way round the Crufts ring. Ahead of him the forwards are expected to apply a high press, to defend by going forward rather than back.“Sarrismo” has been a hit in west London. Only Manchester City have kept the ball more or had more shots. And yet at first glance it is ideally suited to that old José plague-ball of deep defence and isolated, effective attacks.This has always been Mourinho’s system against strong opponents, from that famous Champions League semi-final victory against Guardiola-era Barcelona in 2010 when his Internazionale team simply kicked the ball away and sprinted into their defensive phalanx to the best moments of the current era at Old Trafford.There was a snort of derision when Mourinho suggested last season’s second place in the Premier League was up there with his best achievements. But in among the bluster there is a hint of what really motivates him. The best spell last season, the part Mourinho will cherish, came over eight weeks in February and April when United beat Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham. Each time United fielded two holding midfielders plus either Paul Pogba or Juan Mata in front. Each time victory came while taking significantly less possession than their opponents.For a while this felt like the old methods clunking back into gear – but not for long. The world has shifted on. The Premier League is flush with adaptable high-level coaches, with enough data and post-match analysis to formulate their own countermeasures.This is just one reason why Saturday at the Bridge looks particularly well-poised. Over the summer Sarri talked about his excitement at facing Mourinho for the first time. In response Mourinho talked about how lucky Sarri was to have such “good conditions to work” –that is, conditions he, Mourinho, had helped to create.These include the presence of Eden Hazard, who could make the difference again and whose early progress under Sarri has been used as a stick with which to beat his former manager, another measure of Mourinho’s antiquated caution.There will be no Ander Herrera to man-mark Hazard. No doubt Mourinho’s prep sessions will unearth some alternative measure, just as Sarri, another obsessive, has had 10 days to prepare his counterplay. And something could shift come Saturday afternoon. Chelsea are unbeaten in the league. Should United end that record they will be only four points off top spot for the next few hours, surprisingly so given the general air of theatrical crisis. Most intriguing will be how they go about it, how exactly Mourinho chooses to confront a team whose style seems designed to appeal to the Black Death in his nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c92a3f220bdd1c99c8cb10d823b6bc1fa1eda3e9/0_87_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1cef98ebb03bf4e9f0aab975a46e79f","title":"is my child old enough for a mobile phone","story":"No matter when parents choose to entrust their offspring with a smartphone – and it very much depends on the child in question – there’s agreement that boundaries about usage must be establishedThere are many milestones in the relationship between parents and their children. The first step. The first word. The first time they turn to you and say: “Please stop, you are embarrassing me.” To these, we can now add the moment a parent solemnly hands their child their first mobile phone. But what’s the right age for this to happen? According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – the beginning of secondary school is a good starting point. “It makes them contactable and means they can get in touch with their parents if things go wrong,” she says. “A lot of their peers will get a phone at that age, so it means they can communicate with their friends and feel part of that.” Some believe that the right age may be even earlier. The moment when children start travelling alone on a regular basis is a commonly recommended start point for a phone – which in some cases could be a year or two before or after they start secondary school. Sean Hargrave, a tech journalist and father of three, says: “It’s when your children are spending more time on their own. Their independence and geographic borders start to widen, so it makes sense to trust them with a smartphone.” Statistics suggest that most parents tend to agree that secondary school is the right age for a phone, with a July 2018 survey of 1,000 parents by Tesco Mobile concluding that the mean age most think a child should have their first phone is 11. But a mobile is more than just a phone, it offers access to a multitude of information and ideas. Much of this is positive – a child can use the phone to look up bus timetables and talk to friends, as well as let adults know when they require the parental taxi service – but parents still need to remain engaged, continually talking to children about their internet use and monitoring the sites they access and the amount of time they are online. For this reason, some experts suggest that there’s no such thing as a right age for a phone, with it depending entirely on the inidual child, the parents and the circumstances.  “When a child first receives a smartphone is a parent’s choice,” says Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the NSPCC – which has introduced a guide to children’s online safety called Net Aware. “What’s most important is that mums, dads and carers have early conversations with their children.” For Papadopoulos, it is essential to have these conversations. These shouldn’t be lectures, but instead should encourage a child to think critically. “Until now, they will mainly have communicated face-to-face now they are communicating using texts, memes and emojis. What does it mean if they send a picture to one friend and not another? How do group chat dynamics work? Invite them to talk to you and think about these things.”  Having seen three children reach an age where they are entrusted with a phone, Hargrave has had some testing moments, but also feels children get a lot from their new devices. “They are using them for so many different things – they might be playing games, making films, watching TV, chatting to friends, researching homework,” says Hargrave. “It’s not just sitting in an armchair tapping screens. One of my kids makes films, another does arty stuff, one researches astronomy. They are a force for good, it’s just about having parameters.” And once the boundaries are established, children will be better equipped to enjoy their new device no matter what their age. Encouraging a healthy dynamic around mobile phone usage might even be easier if children get their first phone at a younger age. Hargrave believes that retaining parental access to the phone is essential, which is easier to do with an 11-year-old than a teenager. “The phone is a great safety device and it’s also great for them to communicate with their peers, but you need to keep an eye on it,” he says. “You need to have a conversation, let them know you will look at their phone periodically. You should only do it when they are there and the phone is in front of you. It’s not right to rifle around behind their backs.” It’s natural for parents to worry about their child in any new situation, and mobiles are no exception. While that can be mitigated by the use of parental controls and location tracking, these technological solutions don’t absolve parents from the responsibility of parenting. “We know that this is something parents worry about,” says Papadopoulos. “Up to now, everything the child has done the parent will have done first. But now the child will be using apps the parents have never heard of. It can make us feel insecure. But you do need to engage. You can’t just say: ‘I don’t understand.’ That’s not good enough. You need to understand, you need to get on the apps and figure them out for yourself.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdbf79728fe1b052ae2e3d67fb45248b0ae7a5fe/0_2099_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0120a147f680ba3ba1b92962b23427f5","title":"switch off your phone and start bonding great ideas for family nights in","story":"Cutting down mobile usage is a great way to create family time. Here are the best TV programmes, films and games to enjoy with your family this autumnTrying to find more family time together by limiting your mobile phone usage is a good thing, and experts increasingly agree that it’s important to establish family ground rules for phone usage. Family tech expert Andy Robertson and Tesco Mobile’s new contract for mobile phone usage is designed to help families set healthy limits. It’s a great way to increase the amount of time you have to spend together, particularly as there are absolutely loads of brilliant new family-minded games, films and TV to enjoy on a night in this autumn. Here is our pick of the best.Keep Talking and Nobody ExplodesGame, PS VR  Oculus Rift  HTC Vive  Samsung Gear VRStrapping on a VR headset sounds like a fairly efficient way off blotting out one’s family entirely, but there are a few games designed with social, on-couch multiplayers in mind. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes puts the headset-wearer in the reinforced boots of a bomb disposal technician. They must then describe said explosive to their teammates, who issue increasingly tricky instructions to disarm it from a manual. Cue much filmic “the red wire!” “which red wire?!” bickering and a fair bit of genuine tension. With VR headsets now affordable to those without hereditary peerages, this could be a fine reason to invest.Monster HuntFilmYou could settle for the latest po-faced superhero smash-em-up that plops from Marvel’s blockbuster-peristalsis machine, but it doesn’t hurt to go off-piste with your movie-watching from time to time. And Hollywood is far from the only place producing epic family movies. Spirited Away or Howl’s Moving Castle – any of Hayao Miyazaki’s oeuvre, really – offer just the right balance of whimsy and menace, but for sheer epic scale, try Raman Hui’s charmingly weird action-comedy, and its barmy $150m sequel (Monster Hunt 2). The plot about monsters and humans happily coexisting until they don’t is basically nonsense, but you get a lot of bang, fart jokes and spectacle for your buck.Wynona EarpTV show, Netflix  SYFYThink Buffy on a budget and you’re in the right area. Wild west moustache enthusiast Wyatt Earp was in fact a demon hunter, you see. His curse – the curse of having to shoot demons in the middle of the face – was then passed down through his heirs, until it landed in the lap of Wynona, a wisecracking, leather-jacketed ex-juvie tearaway with a penchant for booze and thumping people. The show’s tone is on the mature end, but is light enough for most young teens, keeping its scares, sexual references and profanity just on the correct side of Mary Whitehouse. It’s a ton of knockabout, demon-slaying fun.PandemicBoard game, 2-4 playersThere is nothing – nothing – more certain to trigger a weeks-long Christmas-ruining family row than a “friendly” game of Monopoly. But the award-winning Pandemic is not your classic, dog-eat-dog board game – it places its emphasis on cooperation, rather than crushing your enemies before sullying their honour with a thumb-and-finger L on the forehead. The setup, admittedly, is bleak: four diseases have ravaged the Earth, and it’s the players’ job to work together to find the cures. You may just save the world. At the very least, by leaving Monopoly languishing in the cupboard where it belongs, you’ll definitely save your family harmony.Brooklyn Nine-NineTV show, NetflixThe Lonely Island’s Andy Samberg is Jake Peralta, an affably man-childish detective in the fictional 99th precinct’s weird melting pot of eccentric coworkers, pop culture references and inept crooks. The gags come thick and fast (Google “Brooklyn Nine-Nine I Want It That Way” for an idea of what to expect) the characters are all lovable and, refreshingly, kind and content and tone never ventures beyond 12A. Plus, the majestic Terry Crews is in it. Oh, did we mention it’s funny? Well it is. Very.Mario Party SwitchGame, Nintendo SwitchFor anyone unfamiliar with the series, this is essentially a virtual board game whose cutesy wickle graphics disguise a brutal crucible of tactics, skill and white-hot rage, as you battle through its dozens of infuriating, competitive mini-games until a winner is finally crowned. You will laugh. You may cry. Be warned, though, you’ll probably also swear.Lost in SpaceTV show, NetflixA Netflix original that seems to have been buried by the critical adoration achieved by some of its stablemates, Lost in Space is a beautiful, mega-budget 4K TV production aimed squarely at the family market. The Robinson family are part of an expedition to find humanity a home beyond the stars, until all manner of problems leave them ... yep, you guessed it. Far superior to the iffy 90s film, this reboot delivers family drama, a delectably evil baddie in Parker Posey’s Dr Smith, and a giant robot saying: “Danger, Will Robinson!” And, crucially, Matt LeBlanc is nowhere to be seen.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53efb5bcbe0e31b0cd8cd53a12a39d55b697f039/1167_388_793_476/master/793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83244ae88d43ef66f040b233427c664","title":"teens without screens one familys attempt to rein in mobile phone usage","story":"How would writer  John Lewis and his family fare when they tried to limit their mobile phone usage? We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3203596088fbd12b8dc05cb38cf3a2881e12943c/0_296_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b45a81e1a8d0f041d96cef2d75926e19","title":"coco khan should i see a doctor about my dreams","story":"When I was younger, I was terrified they would make me lose my mind. Now, I embrace them which I think is a sure sign of maturityI have been told, by a sleep professional no less, that I am a “vivid dreamer”. I remember my dreams often, the twilight theatrics of my unconscious seared into memory by their intensity. Sometimes my dreams upset me, rehashing painful memories and serving them up with an extra side of terror. But mostly they’re just a bit odd, and leave me wondering what I’ve witnessed in the still of the night.Perhaps that’s why interpreting dreams is one of my favourite activities. You can tell a lot about a person by how they do it. Do they subscribe to the superstitious (“A message from the other side!”), the psychological (“This speaks to a wider sense of insecurity”) or the physical (“The human body is not designed to eat whole wheels of cheese”)? Sometimes, the reading of the dream can be more telling than the vision itself: such as the time I told Auntie B that I had had a dream about an owl with guillotine talons. “It’s a message. I knew it would come,” she said, straight-faced. “God is telling you to lose some weight.” This was an interpretation that told me nothing about the dream and everything about why I don’t call Auntie B.It’s funny, but back when I was a teenager, I despised my dreams. I felt attacked by them, persecuted, and insisted on seeing a doctor. I explained to him that although I hadn’t really lived through, say, a castle siege starring Nicolas Cage (as himself, and occasionally as Pingu), I had lived through something. I must have I was tired when I woke up, and throughout the day would be distracted by flickers of the previous night’s dream, with three-second gifs rattling around my brain. I was convinced my dreams would make me lose my mind.But now I think the opposite is happening. I’m sure that my dreams are, in their own way, helping me. They are giving me a space to play out my fears and anxieties. They’re also entertaining. When I recently discovered that the over-60s often dream in black-and-white, I started to do the same, mashing up classic Hollywood films with 2008 urban London and waking up with visions of Clark Gable in Sports Direct.Whenever I ask people about how I will know when I have hit adulthood, someone will say that a key sign is acceptance of yourself, in all your idiosyncrasies. I still have some way to go with that, but after many years I can finally say, I’m blessed to bear witness to my night-time escapades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084e59c09a14979e3e6a7e71feb2c5b58031320d/0_408_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65e7d4d87bf899b298d75cd53462505b","title":"experience pulled a 1500 year old sword lake saga vanecek","story":"People are saying I am the queen of Sweden because of the legend of King ArthurEvery summer, my parents, my six-year-old brother and I go to stay in a cabin by a lake called Vidöstern in Tånnö in southern Sweden, not far from where we live. I like to build sandcastles on the beach, or find rocks to skim across the water and see how many times I can make them bounce. Mamma says she used to play and swim in the lake when she was little, too.On 15 July this year, I was playing on the beach with my friend, when Daddy told me to get a buoy from the cabin: he said the water level in the lake was very shallow and we had to warn any boats that might come along because it was dangerous. He said it had been the hottest summer for 260 years.I waded into the water and it was very soft on my skin and refreshing, a little bit cool but not too cold. It was a nice feeling because the sun was shining and I was very hot. Daddy was begging me to rush so he could watch the World Cup final, but I like to take my time about things so I ignored him.I was crawling along the bottom of the lake on my arms and knees, looking for stones to skim, when my hand and knee felt something long and hard buried in the clay and sand. I pulled it out and saw that it was different from the sticks or rocks I usually find. One end had a point, and the other had a handle, so I pointed it up to the sky, put my other hand on my hip and called out, “Daddy, I’ve found a sword!”I felt like a warrior, but Daddy said I looked like Pippi Longstocking. The sword felt rough and hard, and I got some sticky, icky brown rust on my hands. It started to bend and Daddy splashed up to me, and said I should let him hold it. It was my sword and now he was taking it away! I gave it to him in the end.I ran to my mamma and my mormor – my grandma – and some other relatives who were all sitting outside having fika, which is Swedish for having a sit-down with coffee and cookies. I was yelling, “I found a sword, I found a sword!” Daddy went to show it to our neighbours, whose family has lived in the village for more than 100 years, and they said it looked like a Viking sword. Daddy didn’t get to watch the football in the end.When he showed it to an archaeologist, she said she had goosebumps and that it was at least 1,000 years old. Actually, they now think it’s 1,500 years old – from before the Vikings. She called it “sensational” and said nothing like this had ever been found in Scandinavia before, and that maybe I had found it because of the low water levels. She made me promise not to tell anyone because she and other archaeologists wanted to see if there was anything else buried in the lake they didn’t want anyone else to come and take the treasures.It wasn’t hard to keep the secret. But I did tell one of my best friends, Emmy, and now I know I can trust her because she didn’t tell anybody, except her parents – but they promised not to tell anybody else, so that’s OK.This month, the archaeologists finally came to search the rest of the lake and they found a brooch that is as old as my sword, and a coin from the 18th century. Then they announced the news and I could finally tell everyone at school. I came back from gym class and the whiteboard said, “Saga’s sword” and there were balloons, and the whole class got to have ice-cream.I had to give the sword to the local museum – Daddy explained that it’s part of history and important to share it with others. I felt “boo” that it’s gone away, but “yay” that other people will get to see it. I’m going to try to raise some money to make a replica sword that I can keep.People on the internet are saying I am the queen of Sweden, because in the legend of King Arthur, he was given a sword by a lady in a lake, and that meant he would become king. I am not a lady – I’m only eight – but it’s true I found a sword in the lake. I wouldn’t mind being queen for a day, but when I grow up I want to be a vet. Or an actor in Paris.Now, whenever I go swimming in the lake, I will be looking to see what I can find. It feels like that lake might be a little bit magic. On that day I felt a little bit magic, too.• As told to Moya SarnerDo you have an experience to share?

But then he met the twin he never knew he had...On a summer’s night in 1969, in the only maternity ward in a small town in North America, a woman gave birth to a baby. She was a teenager, unmarried, and she knew well before the little boy was put in her arms that she’d give him up for adoption. That little boy was me – but I was not the only baby born there that night.Growing up, I did not have much in common with my older brother and two younger sisters, who were also adopted. Along with my adoptive parents, they would tease me for spending all my time reading everything from encyclopedias to comics, and call me “the intellectual”. There was no blood link to my parents or siblings, and we shared no characteristics or personality traits.To make sense of this, I invented my own romantic story of how I came into the world. The only thing I had been told about my biological mother was that she was an 18-year-old student, so I decided my father must have been a visiting professor from a European university who had fallen in love with her. The truth would prove to be more extraordinary than any story I could have invented.I studied hard and as an adult moved to Europe and became an academic, finding colleagues and friends who became like family to me, creating a new home for myself. This was a comfort when I came out as gay, and my relationship with my adoptive mother broke down. As a Catholic, she did not accept my sexuality.Then, about 10 years ago, I was giving a workshop for doctoral students at the university where I worked. As I greeted each participant at the door, one man’s “Hello” prompted a weird jolt of recognition. He introduced himself as John and I realised he had my accent. I turned to a colleague and said, “I have a funny feeling I know this guy.”In the break, I told him I thought we’d met before. It turned out we were both born in the same tiny town, but he had moved to the other side of the country when he was six months old, with his parents and twin sister. We had gone to the same university in North America, and as we joked about the professors, we realised that, though we had studied for different degrees, we had sat in some of the same classes. We had even had the same supervisor for our master’s degrees, but a year apart. Chatting over lunch, we discovered that, before pursuing careers in academia, we had both worked in the media. We figured out that we had actually spoken briefly once by phone, when John was a journalist and I was working in PR.It wasn’t just the parallels in our lives that sparked my curiosity: I could feel a connection. We continued meeting for lunch or drinks every six weeks or so, and over the months our friendship grew. We had so much in common: we both felt alienated in the country of our birth, and far more comfortable living in Europe we were both fascinated by art history and music, and hated sport. In one conversation, we realised we were both about to turn 40, one day apart. We joked that four decades earlier, we might have lain in neighbouring cots in the maternity ward.It was in July 2010 that I came home one evening to find the letter that would change everything. It was from social services in my home town, with a message asking me to phone the sender urgently. I knew immediately what it was about: each of my siblings had opened the same letter over the years. My biological mother wanted to find me.I dialled the number and the social worker asked if I wanted to know more about the woman who’d had me adopted. I was told she had been a rebellious teenager, who loved sports but hated school. She had dropped out at 15 and later joined a motorcycle gang – its leader was my father. After I was adopted, she had problems with alcohol and drug addiction, and spent time living on the street.As I heard this, I felt disturbed, untethered. Throughout my life I had relied on the fairytale about my brilliant student mother and professor father to make sense of who I was. Now my identity made no sense at all.Finally, the social worker said that my biological mother was of Native American descent. But I am balding, with a beard and blue eyes – three features Native Americans do not have. This can’t be right, I told her. She assured me there was no mistake: this was my mother, and the reason she was looking for me now was that she was dying of cancer and wanted to meet me before it was too late.I had two weeks to figure out what to do. I didn’t want to hurt my adoptive parents, and I had my doubts that this woman – named, I was later told, Anna-Louise – was really my biological mother. But I believe in the Buddhist philosophy of compassion. If I didn’t meet Anna-Louise for my own sake, should I not do it for hers? I remembered what my father would tell me on my birthday: “There is a woman out there who thinks of you every year on this day, hoping everything is going well for you – that making the heart-wrenching choice to give you up for adoption was the right decision.”I needed to give her that peace before she died. I told the social worker that I was willing to meet Anna-Louise, unless she had any problem with my being gay, in which case I would not go any further with the reunion. The response came back: I could be whoever I was, so long as I was myself, and she would be proud of me. That was an emotional moment: I had never heard my adoptive parents tell me they were proud of who I was.Over the next few months, we exchanged messages and photographs via the social worker. We did not look alike, but it was too late to back out. I flew home for Christmas, and in early January went to meet her. I felt nervous, stressed. What would we say when it became obvious there had been a mistake, that we could not possibly be related?My brother had told me that when he was reunited with his biological mother, he walked into the room and instantly knew she was his and he was hers, and they embraced for 10 minutes, overwhelmed by this certainty. When I met Anna-Louise, I just felt awkward. She hugged me and cried, and I felt no emotion. I played along, because I was happy for her, because she was ill, because I wanted to give her whatever she was searching for. I met her two daughters, who looked so much like her, and who told me they always knew they had a big brother. I just thought it was weird.I agreed to stay in touch, but after our meeting I told the social worker there must be a mistake. She denied it was possible. She said, “Your father must have been blue-eyed and blond.” Everyone was refusing to see what was really quite obvious.I wanted to hear what John would make of all this, but I didn’t see him again until April. His PhD was not going well and he had decided to finish it at a different university, in a different country. We met for a farewell dinner by a lake. We spent most of the evening discussing his news – it wasn’t until dessert that I told him about my disappointing reunion, how I looked nothing like the woman everyone was telling me was my biological mother.He said, “Well, genes aren’t everything. Look at me and my twin sister – she doesn’t look anything like me or my parents. We all used to joke that we picked her up in a train station.”I said, “Well, I’ve promised Anna-Louise I will be there for her for the rest of her life.”John’s face changed. He looked puzzled. “My mother’s name is Anna-Louise,” he said.The seconds passed in silence as we stared at each other. I asked if he had a picture of his twin sister on his phone, and as he searched, I found one on mine of my Anna-Louise. The woman on John’s phone had brown hair and brown eyes, just like the woman in my photograph. His sister’s picture was just like one I had seen of Anna-Louise as a younger woman. The photographs, which I have shared with the , made it clear that they were mother and daughter.I felt the ground open up under my feet. For 41 years, I had lived not the life I was supposed to live, but somebody else’s. I was not some alien creature who had nothing in common with his family – I was a twin. John, the man who had walked into my classroom thousands of miles from home, was my twin brother. He had grown up with our biological parents, and a sister by his side where I should have been. My place had been taken by someone else.We started giggling, nervously. I asked about his parents, what they looked like. He told me his father was bald like me his mother blond with blue eyes. “You do kinda look like my grandfather,” he said.Suddenly there were people who looked like me who shared my interests and, I now believed, my DNA. My head spun. For the first time, everything made sense.We pieced together what must have happened. Two women, both called Anna-Louise, gave birth in the same maternity ward on that summer night in 1969. Back then, there was no ultrasound, so no one knew a baby’s sex before birth. Neither of the fathers was at the hospital and, a million to one chance, they also shared a first name. The three babies were born around midnight and, as was common at the time, the new mothers were sedated so they’d be rested in the morning. Perhaps at night there were fewer staff, and a confusion arose over which baby belonged to which Anna-Louise. The next morning, instead of being returned to my mother with my twin, I was given to the wrong woman, and then adopted. And now my twin and I had found each other, 5,000km from the place of our birth.There was so much still to say, but John was leaving the next day and had to finish packing. I went home but couldn’t sleep. I called my brother back in North America he was driving and had to pull over as he listened in amazement. There were so many unanswered questions. Wouldn’t my biological mother have been told she had given birth to two boys, and objected the next morning when she was handed a boy and a girl? Was the switch intentional – did my biological parents not want two boys, or the authorities think a boy would be adopted more quickly? Is this why I sometimes dreamed I had a twin? Did any of this really happen?The following week, John told his parents he had a friend in Europe, born in the same hospital at about the same date, who had been adopted and who had very little in common with his biological mother – a woman who in fact looked just like John’s own twin sister. He asked them, “Is there anything that happened the night of my birth that I should know about?” They told him, “We don’t ever want you to talk to us about this again.” Not a denial, but a shutting down.His sister followed suit and said she didn’t want to know – she still doesn’t. I cannot tell the woman who believes she is my biological mother – who continues living, defying her doctors’ prognoses – that I am not her son, because it would crush her. Nine years on, nothing has shifted. Everyone is telling the stories they have always told, trapped in a pretence to protect everyone else, as I suspect my biological family has been for nearly 50 years.I did speak to my biological parents once, by Skype. I was chatting online with John, who was visiting the family home, and when I asked how they were, he invited them to join the conversation.I was very scared. I didn’t think it was a good idea: if they weren’t interested in me, I didn’t want to force it. But he introduced me as “a friend from Europe” and that is how I met my biological father for the first time. I looked at him and thought: so that is what I will look like in 25 years. I could recognise myself in him: we have the same eyes.Then I spoke to my biological mother. I felt: here she is, the woman I have known for ever. It was like coming home. John told me that after the call ended, she said: “That was your twin, wasn’t it?” She asks after me, he says, and she calls me the cosmic twin. But she and her husband still don’t want to meet me, and that is painful. I think I’m a good person, I could be a son they would be proud of. I would like to have a relationship with them. But at the same time I can understand that not meeting me is easier than opening up everything they have hidden for so many years.Perhaps that is why, every time John and I talk of doing a formal DNA test, he pulls out, feeling it would be a betrayal. I did a test that showed I have no significant Native American blood. I have requested a copy of my file from social services, but because so much time has passed, it is possible the original documents have been destroyed.For John and me, there is no doubt. When I told colleagues our story, they all guessed who my twin was before I said his name. Although I have never met my biological parents, and John and I have seen each other only a couple of times in the seven years since he moved to another continent, I do feel grateful for the relationships in my life – both old and new. My adoptive brother and I have always been very different, and we still are. But now I understand ours is not an innate connection, not the ease of finishing each other’s sentences that I share with my twin, but a deep-seated tie of togetherness, woven from the threads of a shared childhood, of years of caring for one another. Over the course of our lives, we have grown into brothers.When I finally told my adoptive father this story, he looked at me and said, “So I guess we’re really lucky to have had you as a son.” Our relationship had never been straightforward, but after that we became closer, better at talking about our lives, until he died four years ago. Then, a year and a half ago, I met the love of my life. He is showing me a partnership, a closeness, I have never known.A year ago, I was diagnosed with a terminal degenerative disease. My life is going to be shorter than I had wanted. I now use a wheelchair, and my breathing is deteriorating I cannot work, I cannot travel, I cannot go to concerts and galleries. Accepting this has been difficult, but I am working on it with a psychologist and, strange as it sounds, my life is great. I have my partner, I have my music and my art books, my memories and my friends.When I contemplate the end of my life and the people I want to have around me, it is my brother I think of, not John, my twin. I want my partner to be there, of course, as well as my doctoral supervisor, who has been a mother to me, and my last boss, who has been like a father, and two close friends I picked up on my travels and have held on to ever since. This is the family I have chosen – the family who chose me.• As told to Moya Sarner. Alex Carter is a pseudonym.

He is banned from activities that could be “considered as political or interfering with the internal affairs of other states”, according to a memo seen by the .The Ecuadorian government partially lifted restrictions on Assange’s internet access last weekend, but stipulated he would only be allowed to use the embassy wifi for his personal computer and phone.The WikiLeaks Twitter account stated on Thursday that “after US pressure”, moves had accelerated to grant Assange Ecuadorian citizenship. “His citizenship status is a barrier to rendering him to another state as article 79 of Ecuador’s constitution forbids extradition of citizens,” it added.Sources close to WikiLeaks confirmed to the  on Friday that the legal action was in the works and that there was due to be a press conference in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito.Assange was made an Ecuadorian citizen last December, in an attempt by the nation’s foreign ministry to resolve the political impasse over his continued presence in the UK. The 46-year-old was naturalised after living for five-and-a-half years in the Latin American country’s cramped embassy in Knightsbridge, central London.Earlier this year, the UK Foreign Office revealed Ecuador had asked for Assange, who was born in Australia, to be accredited as a diplomat. The request was dismissed.The Ecuadorian initiative was intended to confer legal immunity on the WikiLeaks founder, allowing him to slip out of the embassy and Britain without being arrested for breaching his former bail conditions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b953e22106906acd6061cccebe9a4b8a72c650b4/0_0_3566_2790/master/3566.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b1e48575b223275cdb8b1156f7892957 960w","title":"the myth of meritocracy who really gets what they deserve","story":"Sorting people by ‘merit’ will do nothing to fix inequality. By  Kwame Anthony AppiahMichael Young was an inconvenient child. His father, an Australian, was a musician and music critic, and his mother, who grew up in Ireland, was a painter of a bohemian bent. They were hard-up, distractible and frequently on the outs with each other. Michael, born in 1915 in Manchester, soon found that neither had much time for him. Once when his parents had seemingly forgotten his birthday, he imagined that he was in for a big end-of-day surprise. But no, they really had forgotten his birthday, which was no surprise at all. He overheard his parents talk about putting him up for adoption and, by his own account, never fully shed his fear of abandonment.Everything changed for him when, at the age of 14, he was sent to an experimental boarding school at Dartington Hall in Devon. It was the creation of the great progressive philanthropists Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst, and it sought to change society by changing souls. There it was as if he had been put up for adoption, because the Elmhirsts treated him as a son, encouraging and supporting him for the rest of their lives. Suddenly he was a member of the transnational elite: dining with President Roosevelt, listening in on a conversation between Leonard and Henry Ford.Young, who has been called the greatest practical sociologist of the past century, pioneered the modern scientific exploration of the social lives of the English working class. He did not just aim to study class, though he aimed to ameliorate the damage he believed it could do. The Dartington ideal was about the cultivation of personality and aptitudes whatever form they took, and the British class structure plainly impeded this ideal. What would supplant the old, caste-like system of social hierarchy? For many today, the answer is “meritocracy” – a term that Young himself coined 60 years ago. Meritocracy represents a vision in which power and privilege would be allocated by inidual merit, not by social origins.Inspired by the meritocratic ideal, many people these days are committed to a view of how the hierarchies of money and status in our world should be organised. We think that jobs should go not to people who have connections or pedigree, but to those best qualified for them, regardless of their background. Occasionally, we will allow for exceptions – for positive discrimination, say, to help undo the effects of previous discrimination. But such exceptions are provisional: when the bigotries of sex, race, class and caste are gone, the exceptions will cease to be warranted. We have rejected the old class society. In moving toward the meritocratic ideal, we have imagined that we have retired the old encrustations of inherited hierarchies. As Young knew, that is not the real story.Young hated the term “welfare state” – he said that it smelled of carbolic – but before he turned 30 he had helped create one. As the director of the British Labour party’s research office, he drafted large parts of the manifesto on which the party won the 1945 election. The manifesto, “Let Us Face the Future”, called for “the establishment of the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain – free, democratic, efficient, progressive, public-spirited, its material resources organised in the service of the British people”. Soon the party, as it promised, raised the school-leaving age to 16, increased adult education, improved public housing, made public secondary school education free, created a national health service and provided social security for all.Just as happened in the US, college attendance shot up in Britain after the second world war, and one of the main indicators of class was increasingly whether you had been to university. The middle-class status of meagerly compensated librarians reflected a vocational requirement for an education beyond secondary school that the better-paid assembly-line workers were working-class reflected the absence of such a requirement. Working-class consciousness – legible in the very name of the Labour party, founded in 1900 – spoke of class mobilisation, of workers securing their interests. The emerging era of education, by contrast, spoke of class mobility – blue collars giving way to white. Would mobility undermine class consciousness?These questions preyed on Young. Operating out of a community studies institute he set up in Bethnal Green, he helped create and nurture dozens and dozens of programmes and organisations, all attending to social needs he had identified. The Consumers’ Association was his brainchild, along with its magazine, Which?. So was the Open University, which has taught more than 2 million students since Young founded it in 1969, making it the largest academic institution in the UK by enrolment. Yet education mattered to him not just as a means of mobility, but as a way to make people more forceful as citizens, whatever their station – less easily bulldozed by commercial developers or the government planners of Whitehall. Late in life, he even set up the School for Social Entrepreneurs. Over the decades, he wanted to strengthen the social networks – the “social capital”, as social scientists say these days – of communities that get pushed around by those who were increasingly claiming a lion’s share of society’s power and wealth.What drove him was his sense that class hierarchies would resist the reforms he helped implement. He explained how it would happen in a 1958 satire, his second best-seller, entitled The Rise of the Meritocracy. Like so many phenomena, meritocracy was named by an enemy. Young’s book was ostensibly an analysis written in 2033 by a historian looking back at the development over the decades of a new British society. In that distant future, riches and rule were earned, not inherited. The new ruling class was determined, the author wrote, by the formula “IQ + effort  merit”. Democracy would give way to rule by the cleverest – “not an aristocracy of birth, not a plutocracy of wealth, but a true meritocracy of talent.” This is the first published appearance of the word “meritocracy”, and the book aimed to show what a society governed on this principle would look like.Young’s vision was decidedly dystopian. As wealth increasingly reflects the innate distribution of natural talent, and the wealthy increasingly marry one another, society sorts into two main classes, in which everyone accepts that they have more or less what they deserve. He imagined a country in which “the eminent know that success is a just reward for their own capacity, their own efforts”, and in which the lower orders know that they have failed every chance they were given. “They are tested again and again … If they have been labelled ‘dunce’ repeatedly they cannot any longer pretend their image of themselves is more nearly a true, unflattering reflection.”But one immediate difficulty was that, as Young’s narrator concedes, “nearly all parents are going to try to gain unfair advantages for their offspring”. And when you have inequalities of income, one thing people can do with extra money is to pursue that goal. If the financial status of your parents helped determine your economic rewards, you would no longer be living by the formula that “IQ + effort  merit”.Young, who died in 2002 at the age of 86, saw what was happening. “Education has put its seal of approval on a minority,” he wrote, “and its seal of disapproval on the many who fail to shine from the time they are relegated to the bottom streams at the age of seven or before.” What should have been mechanisms of mobility had become fortresses of privilege. He saw an emerging cohort of mercantile meritocrats who can be insufferably smug, much more so than the people who knew they had achieved advancement not on their own merit but because they were, as somebody’s son or daughter, the beneficiaries of nepotism. The newcomers can actually believe they have morality on their side. So assured have the elite become that there is almost no block on the rewards they arrogate to themselves.The carapace of “merit”, Young argued, had only inoculated the winners from shame and reproach.Americans, unlike the British, don’t talk much about working-class consciousness it is sometimes said that all Americans are, by self-conception, middle class. But this, it turns out, is not currently what Americans themselves think. In a 2014 National Opinion Research Center survey, more Americans identified as working-class than as middle-class. One (but only one) strand of the populism that tipped Donald Trump into power expressed resentment toward a class defined by its education and its values: the cosmopolitan, degree-laden people who dominate the media, the public culture and the professions in the US. Clinton swept the 50 most educated counties, as Nate Silver noted shortly after the 2016 election Trump swept the 50 least. Populists think that liberal elites look down on ordinary Americans, ignore their concerns and use their power to their own advantage. They may not call them an upper class, but the indices that populists use to define them – money, education, connections, power – would have picked out the old upper and upper-middle classes of the last century.And many white working-class voters feel a sense of subordination, derived from a lack of formal education, and that can play a part in their politics. Back in the early 1970s, the sociologists Richard Sennett and Jonathan Cobb recorded these attitudes in a study memorably titled The Hidden Injuries of Class. This sense of vulnerability is perfectly consistent with feeling superior in other ways. Working-class men often think that middle-class and upper-class men are unmanly or undeserving. Still, a significant portion of what we call the American white working class has been persuaded that, in some sense, they do not deserve the opportunities that have been denied to them.They may complain that minorities have unfair advantages in the competition for work and the distribution of government benefits. Nevertheless, they do not think it is wrong either that they do not get jobs for which they believe they are not qualified, or that the jobs for which they are qualified are typically less well paid. They think minorities are getting “handouts” – and men may feel that women are getting unfair advantages, too – but they don’t think the solution is to demand handouts for themselves. They are likely to regard the treatment of racial minorities as an exception to the right general rule: they think the US mostly is and certainly should be a society in which opportunities belong to those who have earned them.If a new dynastic system is nonetheless taking shape, you might conclude that meritocracy has faltered because, as many complain, it isn’t meritocratic enough. If talent is capitalised efficiently only in high tax brackets, you could conclude that we have simply failed to achieve the meritocratic ideal. Maybe it is not possible to give everyone equally good parenting, but you could push more rigorously for merit, making sure every child has the educational advantages and is taught the social tricks that successful families now hoard for their children. Why isn’t that the right response?Because, Young believed, the problem was not just with how the prizes of social life were distributed it was with the prizes themselves. A system of class filtered by meritocracy would, in his view, still be a system of class: it would involve a hierarchy of social respect, granting dignity to those at the top, but denying respect and self-respect to those who did not inherit the talents and the capacity for effort that, combined with proper education, would give them access to the most highly remunerated occupations. This is why the authors of his fictional Chelsea Manifesto – which, in The Rise of the Meritocracy, is supposed to serve as the last sign of resistance to the new order – ask for a society that “both possessed and acted upon plural values”, including kindliness, courage and sensitivity, so all had a chance to “develop his own special capacities for leading a rich life”. Even if you were somehow upholding “IQ + effort  merit”, then your equation was sponsoring a larger inequality.This alternative vision, in which each of us takes our allotment of talents and pursues a distinctive set of achievements and the self-respect they bring, was one that Young had learned from his schooling at Dartington Hall. And his profound commitment to social equality can seem, in the mode of schoolhouse utopias, quixotic. Yet it draws on a deeper philosophical picture. The central task of ethics is to ask what it is for a human life to go well. A plausible answer is that living well means meeting the challenge set by three things: your capacities, the circumstances into which you were born, and the projects that you yourself decide are important. Because each of us comes equipped with different talents and is born into different circumstances, and because people choose their own projects, each of us faces his or her own challenge. There is no comparative measure that would enable an assessment of whether your life or my life is better Young was right to protest the idea that “people could be put into rank order of worth”. What matters in the end is not how we rank against others. We do not need to find something that we do better than anyone else what matters, to the Dartingtonians, is simply that we do our best.The ideal of meritocracy, Young understood, confuses two different concerns. One is a matter of efficiency the other is a question of human worth. If we want people to do difficult jobs that require talent, education, effort, training and practice, we need to be able to identify candidates with the right combination of aptitude and willingness and provide them incentives to train and practice.Because there will be a limited supply of educational and occupational opportunities, we will have to have ways of allocating them – some principles of selection to match people to positions, along with appropriate incentives to ensure the necessary work gets done. If these principles of selection have been reasonably designed, we can say, if we like, that the people who meet the criteria for entering the schools or getting the jobs “merit” those positions. This is, to enlist some useful philosophers’ jargon, a matter of “institutional desert”. People deserve these positions in the sense in which people who buy winning lottery tickets deserve their winnings: they got them by a proper application of the rules.Institutional desert, however, has nothing to do with the intrinsic worthiness of the people who get into college or who get the jobs, any more than lottery winners are people of special merit and losers are somehow less worthy. Even on the highest levels of achievement, there is enormous contingency at play. If Einstein had been born a century earlier, he might have made no momentous contributions to his field a Mozart who came of age in the early 20th century and trained on 12-tone rows might not have done so either. Neither might have made much use of their aptitudes had they grown up among the Amazonian Nukak.And, of course, the capacity for hard work is itself the result of natural endowments and upbringing. So neither talent nor effort, the two things that would determine rewards in the world of the meritocracy, is itself something earned. People who have, as The Rise of the Meritocracy bluntly put it, been repeatedly “labelled ‘dunce’” still have capacities and the challenge of making a meaningful life. The lives of the less successful are not less worthy than those of others, but not because they are as worthy or more worthy. There is simply no sensible way of comparing the worth of human lives.Put aside the vexed notion of “merit”, and a simpler picture emerges. Money and status are rewards that can encourage people to do the things that need doing. A well-designed society will elicit and deploy developed talent efficiently. The social rewards of wealth and honour are inevitably going to be unequally shared, because that is the only way they can serve their function as incentives for human behaviour. But we go wrong when we deny not only the merit but the dignity of those whose luck in the genetic lottery and in the historical contingencies of their situation has left them less rewarded.Yes, people will inevitably want to share both money and status with those they love, seeking to get their children financial and social rewards. But we should not secure our children’s advantages in a way that denies a decent life to the children of others. Each child should have access to a decent education, suitable to her talents and her choices each should be able to regard him- or herself with self-respect. Further democratising the opportunities for advancement is something we know how to do, even if the state of current politics in Britain and the US has made it increasingly unlikely that it will be done anytime soon. But such measures were envisaged in Young’s meritocratic dystopia, where inheritance was to hold little sway. His deeper point was that we also need to apply ourselves to something we do not yet quite know how to do: to eradicate contempt for those who are disfavoured by the ethic of effortful competition.“It is good sense to appoint inidual people to jobs on their merit,” Young wrote. “It is the opposite when those who are judged to have merit of a particular kind harden into a new social class without room in it for others.” The goal is not to eradicate hierarchy and to turn every mountain into a salt flat we live in a plenitude of incommensurable hierarchies, and the circulation of social esteem will always benefit the better novelist, the more important mathematician, the savvier businessman, the faster runner, the more effective social entrepreneur. We cannot fully control the distribution of economic, social and human capital, or eradicate the intricate patterns that emerge from these overlaid grids. But class identities do not have to internalise those injuries of class. It remains an urgent collective endeavour to revise the ways we think about human worth in the service of moral equality.This can sound utopian, and, in its fullest conception, it undoubtedly is. Yet nobody was more practical-minded than Young, institution-builder par excellence. It is true that the stirrings of Young’s conscience responded to the personal as well as the systemic dying of cancer in a hospital ward, he worried whether the contractor-supplied African immigrants who wheeled around the food trolleys were getting minimum wage. But his compassion was welded to a sturdy sense of the possible. He did not merely dream of reducing inherited privilege he devised concrete measures to see that it happened, in the hope that all citizens could have the chance to develop their “own special capacities for leading a rich life”. He had certainly done exactly that himself. In the imaginary future of The Rise of the Meritocracy, there was still a House of Lords, but it was occupied solely by people who had earned their places there through distinguished public service. If anyone had merited a place in that imaginary legislature, it would have been him.That was far from true of the House of Lords he grew up with, which was probably one reason why his patron Leonard Elmhirst declined a peerage when offered one in the 1940s in the circles he moved in, he made clear, “acceptance would neither be easy for me to explain nor easy for my friends to comprehend”. So it is more than a little ironic that when Young, the great egalitarian, was offered a peerage in 1978, he took it. Naturally, he chose for himself the title Baron Young of Dartington, honouring the institution he had served as a trustee since the age of 27. As you would expect, he used the opportunity to speak about the issues that moved him in the upper house of the British parliament. But there is a further, final irony. A major reason he had accepted the title (“guardedly”, as he told his friends) was that he was having difficulties meeting the expense of travelling up to London from his home in the country. Members of the Lords not only got a daily allowance if they attended the house they got a pass to travel free on the railways. Michael Young entered the aristocracy because he needed the money.This article originally appeared in the New York Review of Books.

May was courteously heard out as she explained the fearsome political constraints she faces back home. And while EU27 leaders decided, as expected, that not enough progress has yet been made to justify a special summit in November, they did not rule out calling one nearer the time. The prime minister did not turn up with an immediate solution to the Irish backstop conundrum but no one really expected her to, after talks broke down last weekend with Dominic Raab’s theatrical day trip.Not quite: May’s willingness to entertain the idea of an extension to the transition period – to allow more time to negotiate the future trading relationship she still insists is the best way of avoiding border checks in Ireland – was an indication that new ideas have been thrown up in the course of intensive negotiations between the two sides in recent weeks.The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspIn particular, UK officials were encouraged by the fact that having first rejected it out of hand, the commission has been willing to engage seriously with the UK’s proposal for the Irish backstop.That would effectively see the whole UK, rather than Northern Ireland alone, remain in the customs union – something the EU is sceptical could be negotiated in time for the end of the transition in December 2020, but is prepared to work on.Perhaps. The two sticking points May identified when she addressed MPs last Monday clearly still remain – but we have a better sense of what both sides are doing to try to resolve them.First, the commission has no intention of abandoning the Northern Ireland-only backstop that so enrages the Democratic Unionists, and to which May reiterated her staunch opposition at her Brussels press conference on Thursday.The EU27 still insist it must be included in the legal text of the withdrawal agreement, but they are willing to help out with her political difficulties by offering solemn undertakings to crack on with negotiating the UK’s version.Similarly, Michel Barnier’s team have been working hard on how to “de-dramatise” any border checks that would be necessary in the Irish Sea under their version of the backstop – siting them away from ports, for example – to help assuage critics’ practical concerns.Secondly, on whether the backstop risks becoming “indefinite”, May reassured Leo Varadkar when they met that her government did not resile from the promise it signed up to last December, that backstop arrangements would remain in place “unless and until” a viable alternative is negotiated that avoids new checks.That rules out writing an end date into the deal, as some of her cabinet have been pressing for but could allow a break clause – some kind of mechanism for Britain to say it thinks it has met the conditions, and ask to exit the backstop.That is in the hands of May’s Tory colleagues. EU leaders were crystal clear this week that the main roadblock to finalising a deal lies in Westminster, not Brussels.The two sides hoped the building blocks for a deal were in place last week, before it became clear the prime minister’s cabinet would not wear it – let alone her backbenchers, or the DUP.The pizza plotters who met in Andrea Leadsom’s office on Monday night discussed the idea of an extension to the transition, and were not overly concerned, if it helped unlock a deal.But they will want to scrutinise the wording of any break clause for the backstop very closely, and would need to decide whether they believe reassurances on the Northern Ireland-only backstop.Judging by Michael Gove’s demand last week for formal legal advice on the implications of any new draft text, levels of trust are not exactly high. And outside the cabinet, the backstop remains a potential dealbreaker for a number of MPs. A much larger number are noisily sceptical about May’s plans for Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.Away from the knotty details, a growing number of previously loyal MPs – Nick Boles being the latest recruit – are expressing their frustration at what they regard as a sense of drift.Throughout the past two years, May has repeatedly kicked the can down the road, rather than face down hardline Brexiters, or the DUP. But if her party allows her to remain in place for these last crucial weeks of the Brexit endgame, she will not be able to postpone the final, potentially explosive confrontation with her Tory critics any longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5573461a49b702df193e1f7085914528746bdf6/58_95_2942_1765/master/2942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=609457472a9a8962d2bf5b447f0377c8","title":"tory rightwingers seek to embarrass may over high powered rifles ban","story":"ERG members aim to stymie .50-calibre weapons ban to show strength before vote on Brexit dealHard Brexit Tories will use a Commons vote to try to overturn Home Office plans to ban high-powered military-grade rifles in a show of political defiance aimed at Theresa May.Police want the .50 calibre or higher weapons – which can immobilise a vehicle or truck from a mile away – banned because they fear a terrorist who got hold of one would be impossible to defend against.But 35 Tory MPs – many of whom are understood to be members of the European Research Group (ERG) – have decided to back an amendment to block the proposed ban.Steve Baker, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin are among the 35 Tory MPs supporting the amendment to the offensive weapons bill that would prevent a ban on rifles that have a power of “over 13,600 joules at the muzzle”.David Jamieson, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner and former Labour MP, said he was “extremely concerned” to learn of the proposed amendments.“Such weapons have no place in this country to be the possession of non-military personnel,” Jamieson wrote to Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Tory MP behind the amendment“You will be aware it was .50 calibre rifles which were used by the IRA to murder British soldiers and members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in the 1990s. I can see no reasonable explanation for any member of the public to own such a weapon.”MPs were informed that 129 rifles of .50 calibre were held under licence in England and Wales, mainly to be fired on Ministry of Defence ranges in long-range shooting competitions.Critics of the proposed ban have said that no .50 weapon has been used in a crime in the UK since the IRA disarmed. Clifton-Brown told MPs in June he believed the ban was disproportionate, and that people who hold firearms are “some of the most law-abiding people in this country”.Members of the hard-Brexit ERG have been looking for a chance to show Theresa May they are unhappy with her Brexit strategy, and the bill is the first available opportunity.Their aim is to warn the prime minister they have the numbers to vote down any Brexit deal based on Chequers. If more than 15 Tory MPs are prepared to vote alongside Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties, May’s deal would almost certainly be voted down.Police forces support the ban on the guns, which the National Crime Agency says have the power to immobilise a light or medium-size vehicle or truck at 1,800 metres and are too powerful to be used for sporting purposes.Mark Groothuis, the national firearms licensing liaison officer for counter-terrorism policing, also told MPs during the bill’s committee stages that he was concerned that “if one of these guns were to be stolen, again with the ammunition, and if it were to get into terrorist hands, it could be very difficult to fight against or to protect against.“There is very little – nothing, as far as I know – that the police service have that could go up against a .50 in the way of body armour or even protected vehicles,” the senior police officer added.Louise Haigh MP, the shadow policing and crime minister, said: “These rifles are weapons of enormous and destructive power, which senior officers have warned they have no known protection against. They should have no place in the hands of the public. Tory MPs should come to their senses, and stop playing politics with public safety.”The Clifton-BrownERG amendment also has the support of the Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, whose party has threatened to vote down the budget, and one Brexit-supporting Labour member, Kate Hoey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dfa952abcf35d3796b8d596bc2bfd45e1920ecf/1066_333_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce32196758d4b48fd4d2f1cb86b9c69c","title":"brexit may summit tory brexiters would vote down extra payments to eu for longer transition says rees mogg politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenIt is a damning indictment of the sorry state of our country’s politics that, at a time when digital giants such as Facebook are rightly coming under public scrutiny, our former deputy prime minister has been hired to lobby on their behalf.Labour is committed to slamming shut the revolving door between politics and big business, which for too long has corroded public trust in politics.That’s all from me for today.Comments are due to stay open until about 4pm.

(See 1.44pm.)Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Oculus and Instagram are at the heart of so many people’s everyday lives – but also at the heart of some of the most complex and difficult questions we face as a society: the privacy of the inidual the integrity of our democratic process the tensions between local cultures and the global internet the balance between free speech and prohibited content the power and concerns around artificial intelligence and the wellbeing of our children.I believe that Facebook must continue to play a role in finding answers to those questions – not by acting alone in Silicon Valley, but by working with people, organisations, governments and regulators around the world to ensure that technology is a force for good.I am looking forward to being part of this endeavour. Throughout my public life I have relished grappling with difficult and controversial issues and seeking to communicate them to others. I hope to use some of those skills in my new role.In his World at One interview Sir John Sawers also said he thought Saudia Arabia would have only carried out the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi if it thought it had “licence” to behave like that from Washington. He said:This appalling killing in Istanbul, it seems to me all the evidence points to it being ordered and carried out by people close to Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. I don’t think he would have done this if he hadn’t thought he had licence from the US administration to, frankly, behave as he wished to do so.Sawers claimed President Trump was now realising “just how dangerous it is to have people acting with the sense that they have impunity in their relationship with the United States”.Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, told the World at One that Brexit would make the UK more vulnerable to attacks like the Russian novichok poisoning in Salisbury. He is giving a speech today in which he will say that Russia would not have used a nerve agent on the streets of America or Germany. Asked to explain this on the World at One, Sawers said:They thought they could pick on Britain and bully us because we were looking weak. Actually I think Theresa May and her government responded very strongly and forcefully to the Skripal attack. But it was only because we were able to carry our European partners, the Americans and others, with us. It was through the engagement of others that we were able to push back and have a credible response to the Skripal attack.When pressed on how Brexit was a factor, he went on:I think what it is is it’s do with Britain looking weak, looking isolated. The Americans to some extent are walking away from their relationship with Europe, and we are walking away from the relationship with the European Union. The west is fragmented.Sawers, a long-standing critic of Brexit, said the UK had more influence with the US as a member of the EU. What we are doing is losing traction, both in Washington and in Europe. And that will make Britain less influential on the world stage ...We will no longer be shaping the rules for data sharing and data privacy in Europe, which is increasingly vital to our security. We will not be automatic members of the information systems that European countries use for advanced notification of the movement of dangerous people. And we won’t be members of things like Europol and the intelligence centre.Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has responded to Michel Barnier’s claim that even he could not say how Brexit would bring actual benefits to the people who voted for it. (See 10.56am.) Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem deputy prime minister, is joining Facebook as its head of global affairs and communications, the Financial Times reports (paywall). It says Clegg “agree to take on the job after months of wooing by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, who told Mr Clegg he would have a leading role in shaping the company’s strategy.” Clegg, who lost his seat at the 2017 general election, is going to relocated with his family to Silicon Valley in California, the FT says.One of the surprising aspects of this story is that this is the sort of job that you might have expected to go to one of Clegg’s former special advisers. By coincidence, Jack Blanchard in his London Playbook briefing has a good list of former Whitehall advisers who have gone on to work for tech companies. There are 15 names on his list.In an article for today’s Evening Standard Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, urges Londoners to join him on tomorow’s People’s Vote march. He says:I never wanted or expected to back a public vote on the final deal (or no deal). I campaigned as hard as anyone for Britain to remain in the EU during the referendum.I respect the result — while also fulfilling my duty to Londoners, who voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, by making the case to stay in the single market and customs union. Theresa May has had every opportunity to reach a deal with the EU that protects jobs and growth, today and in the decades ahead. But the prime minister has failed. She has been unable to agree a deal within her own cabinet, let alone with the EU. The summit in Brussels this week was supposed to be the last opportunity to agree a deal, and yet the negotiations are so far from finished that Brexit wasn’t even on the agenda ...While Londoners voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, it doesn’t matter whether you ticked the leave or remain box at the referendum — this is about the future not the past. None of us voted for the shambles the government has created.None of us voted to make ourselves poorer.None of us voted to make life harder for our children and grandchildren.We all deserve a say on the final terms of the deal. It’s time to take back control. As the Evening Standard reports, many other MPs from London and the south east are supporting the march.You can read all the ’s Brexit coverage here. Here are some of the other more interesting stories and articles around this morning from other news organisations.David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, was calling ministers yesterday to urge a change of course in the negotiations. “He is definitely on manoeuvres,” one recipient of a call said.Allies of Mr Davis say that he wants to “change the policy, not the PM”, but it is thought that a small but growing band of Conservative MPs would like to see him installed as a caretaker leader.Mrs May used Prime Minister’s Questions this week to reiterate her commitment to the “precious Union of the United Kingdom”, but her admission that the transition period could be extended prompted an unequivocal response from Scottish Tories and Scotland’s fishing industry.It emerged last night that Mrs May’s inner sanctum Brexit Cabinet of 12 senior ministers had thrashed out the transition extension proposal at a tense meeting last Thursday.One senior minister told The Sun yesterday that the Cabinet would only accept a transition extension of “three to six months”, and no longer.But other members of Mrs May’s full Cabinet were “blindsided” by her transition extension announcement.The idea was also given “reluctant and caveat-ed backing” at a secret meeting of Cabinet Brexiteers over pizza on Monday evening, but only on the condition EU drop NIUK backstop demand.At a recent cabinet meeting, Sajid Javid listed the options: if talks fail, he said, there can be an immediate stimulus. A chance to push through long-overdue changes and advertise Britain as a self-confident country, presenting itself anew to the world – with tax cuts to show it means business. Other cabinet members are talking to each other about similar ideas. A plan to ameliorate a no-deal Brexit is starting to emerge.It would need to be bold, striking – and, ideally, focus minds in Brussels. In his budget this month, for example, the chancellor could say that, in the event of no deal, Britain would immediately begin unilateral free trade by abolishing all import tariffs on everything except food.Another option is being whispered about in private by cabinet ministers: a mitigated ‘no deal’. The UK would pay the EU money in exchange for a series of mini agreements that would ensure that the planes could keep flying, that customs checks were kept as manageable as possible, and the EU and the UK could trade together in the way that advanced economies do when they don’t have a trade agreement. It would be expensive. I understand that at cabinet this week Philip Hammond explicitly argued that the UK should pay the EU almost all of the £39bn, even if it leaves without a deal, to facilitate these kinds of arrangements. An acrimonious no deal is still an option, with Mrs May reneging on whatever she promised last December — with significant disruption. Ironically, this would hit Ireland as hard, if not harder, than the United Kingdom.There has been a subtle shift in recent days within the cabinet. Ministers who used to say Britain could not possibly leave without a deal are now starting to say they could not possibly give in to this pressure from Brussels. One cabinet member — a Brexit swing-voter — now believes Mrs May should start to tell voters how tough no deal will be but that the EU may well have left us with no respectable alternative. The threat of cabinet resignations has also receded (for the time being). Nothing is being agreed with the EU, so there is nothing to walk out over.9) She knows, because her Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins has told her, that her best chance - probably her only chance of securing a Brexit deal - is to sign up for the customs union.10) In its absence, no-deal Brexit is massively in play.11) But a customs-union Brexit deal would see her Brexiter MPs become incandescent with fury.12)Labour of course would be on the spot, since its one practical Brexit policy is to stay in the Customs Union.13) This therefore is May’s Robert Peel moment. She could agree a Customs Union Brexit and get it through Parliament with Labour support - while simultaneously cleaving her own party in two.14) It is a Customs Union Brexit, or leave the EU without a deal.15) Which will May choose? Ultimately this is her choice, and hers alone. It is her moment in history.Theresa May is to host a vast conference call with business leaders about Brexit and the Brussels summit, No 10 has said, speaking to 120 chief executives and chairpeople on Friday afternoon.The call, which is due to last up to an hour, is “to update business on the Brexit negotiations and the European Council discussions”, May’s spokeswoman said. Companies involved include Tesco, RBS and Diageo, as well business groups like the CBI.May has faced significant pressure from the business world about the continued uncertainty of the Brexit outcome, and this is the first time she will have personally taken part in this post-summit conference call, which is usually led by officials.“She’ll be talking to them about the discussions this week at council, and taking questions from them,” the spokeswoman said. “She was keen to talk to them after an important week.” She will host the call from her constituency. We are promised more details after it is over.May is still for now in Brussels for the post-summit Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) conference, where she is meeting the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, among others.Today’s Evening Standard splash amounts to a strong plug for tomorrow’s People’s Vote march in London. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, gave an interview to France Inter radio this morning. Barnier was one of the people who emerged best from this week’s summit he was repeatedly praised by EU leaders for his handling of the negotiation, in a way that implied they weren’t happy about the UK’s government’s repeated attempts to bypass him in the hope of getting a better response by dealing with EU heads of government instead. Here are the main points from the interview.A deal is possible, it is desirable but it is difficult.I have no deep conviction on this subject, because in the UK the political situation is very complex and I don’t know what decisions Theresa May will take. I hope for a deal, I am working for it, because it is in our common interest.There is no added value in Brexit. It is a negative negotiation. No-one has been able to show me any added value in Brexit, not even Mr Farage, when I met him in my office at his request and I asked him ‘Show me how the decision to leave the EU provides solutions to the anxieties, discontents and sometimes the anger of the British people’.I don’t want to impose a hard Brexit. A hard Brexit is the absence of a deal and I am working for a deal. But Brexit can’t be soft. It has innumerable consequences. It was chosen by the British. Were they well informed at the time they voted? They were not told all the consequences - even Mr Farage recognised that everything was not spelt out in the campaign.In his Today interview Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, also said that there would be “consequences” for Britain’s relationship with Saudi Arabia if it is found that the Saudis murdered missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But he did also say that the UK response would be “considered” and that it would take into account Britain’s strategic relationship with the Saudis. He told the programme:If the stories that we read about are true, and if you are asking me whether that will have consequences for the relationship with Saudi Arabia, then yes, of course it will.What is alleged to have happened is totally inconsistent with our values and what we believe in. Not just the brutality - if it happened - but also the fact that he was a journalist. Those things are completely unacceptable to the United Kingdom. If the stories turn out to be true, part of our reaction will depend on the Saudi reaction and whether we sense that they are taking it as seriously as we are taking it. Our relationship with Saudi is a strategic relationship. Our response will be considered because we have to recognise in that strategic relationship that they share intelligence with us that helps keep people safe on the streets of Britain. But even taking into account all those things, in the end, if these stories are true, we have to be absolutely clear it would not be consistent with our values.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was also on the Today programme this morning. Here are the main points from his interview.The reason why this week has been difficult is because Theresa May has not buckled. She has held firm. She has stuck to her principles. It is precisely because she has not capitulated that we have not concluded this agreement. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, told Newsnight last night that that talks “look more like a capitulation than a negotiation.” He also complained about the UK offering to extend the transition. As Jack Blanchard writes in his London Playbook morning briefing, this is about “as basic a misunderstanding of the EU’s position as you will hear today” because the EU views extending the transition as something that would actually help the UK, not disadvantage it.The one thing I would say to my colleagues is that the great strength of the EU in these negotiations is that the 27 EU nations have remained united. We now need to do the same behind Theresa May to maximise her negotiating leverage in Brussels and make sure she does come back with that deal that honours the letter and spirit of the referendum decision.The substantive area of disagreement is whether we would agree to a backstop which would allow for customs barriers down the Irish Sea - the effective break-up of the United Kingdom - or whether we agree to a backstop which would allow the UK as a whole to stay in the customs union indefinitely.Neither of those are acceptable. Those are two very important matters of principle for the United Kingdom.The main development at yesterday’s summit was May’s admission that she was open to the idea of extending the Brexit transition by a year. The reaction from her party was so hostile that, by the end of the day, she was distancing herself from the idea, but that has not stopped the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg this morning doing his best to bury it for good. Rees-Mogg is chair of the European Research Group, the highly organised caucus of around 50 or so Tories pushing for a harder Brexit (if the ERG were a separate party, Rees-Mogg would get two questions every week at PMQs, instead of the SNP’s Ian Blackford) and in an interview on the Today programme he said the ERG would block any legislation agreeing extra payments to the EU for a longer transition. He told the programme:If the government is saying to us we will pay £39bn plus, for the extension, £15bn or £16bn more per annum, and we don’t have anything in return other than a waffly political declaration, I think that will be very hard to get through the House of Commons. I think it will be very hard for anyone to justify to their constituents.(Other people have said that extending the transition for a year would cost the UK £10bn in extra payments to the EU, but Rees-Mogg is quoting a higher figure on the basis the UK would no longer qualify for its rebate.) There has been speculation that the ERG might introduce an amendment to the finance bill to this effect. But Rees-Mogg said it was more like that they would target the EU withdrawal agreement bill, the one due to be introduced early next year legislating to implement the withdrawal agreement. He said:In terms of what may happen legislatively, I think the implementation bill will probably be more important because that will set out the legal basis for making any payments to the EU and it will be possible to look to amend that. Amending finance bills is much harder than it sometimes sounds. So I think the withdrawal bill implementation will be the key legislative point.The ERG on their own cannot win votes in the Commons. But, if they side with the opposition, they can defeat the government. So, if May did want to legislate for a longer transition period, with extra money going to the EU as a result, she would only get that through the Commons with the support of Labour.There will be more Brexit summit fall-out today, but there’s not much on the agenda formally.

But having made six ODI centuries in the past three years – the most recent being 147 against Australia during England’s world-record 481 for six at Trent Bridge in the summer – he represents a more than useful replacement.An alternative would be Joe Denly. The 32-year-old may have arrived early on tour as a replacement spin-bowling all-rounder following the side injury suffered by Liam Dawson, but he comes after a fine season opening for Kent in the white-ball formats.Denly may well earn his first ODI for nine years regardless, with England mulling over whether to augment the bowling attack with his leg-breaks following Adil Rashid’s impressive four-wicket haul in Wednesday’s seven-wicket on the same ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be938ad7518de2ae2ba6cb331188dccf77b2d6d7/0_0_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8469493be997baa3618567a97a9c8351","title":"how mercedex carried lewis hamilton to verge of his fifth f1 title","story":"Under immense pressure from Ferrari there were slips, errors and obstacles to surmount but out of the lowest moment of the season came the combined strength to propel Hamilton to the verge of his fifth world title at the US Grand PrixLewis Hamilton stands ready to prove that his rivals have searched in vain for any weaknesses to exploit at this weekend’s US Grand Prix. This season he has been under pressure as never before but has come through it he is champion elect and Austin will likely see him crowned. If so he will rightly collect the approbation a five-time world champion deserves only two other drivers have managed it in the history of the sport.Yet he knows it will be an honour truly shared. He is an exceptional driver but more than aware of how hard his Mercedes team have worked to make it happen. Much of the focus this season has been on Ferrari’s failures yet this will be a championship won by Mercedes as much as lost by the Scuderia.Hamilton will equal Juan Manuel Fangio’s five championships and be only two behind Michael Schumacher’s record of seven if he takes the title at the Circuit of the Americas. He will do so if he wins and his Ferrari rival Sebastian Vettel finishes below second, or if he finishes eight points clear of Vettel.Hamilton, still only 33, has spoken of the intensity of the fight he, Vettel and Ferrari have engaged in this year. It was a mighty struggle from the off and, while Hamilton has been magnificent, his team have demonstrated they remain the pre-eminent force in F1.What has stood out about Mercedes’ performance is that it has been far removed from the almost flawless runs that have secured their past four drivers’ and constructors’ championships. There have been slips, errors and obstacles – far from plain sailing in the teeth of a gale presented by a resurgent Ferrari.With the cars closely matched the two teams traded punches across the first half of the season. Mercedes had begun on the ropes. A strategy error in Australia cost Hamilton a likely win. At the next race in Bahrain he took a grid penalty because of a gearbox change and with Vettel victorious he held a 17-point lead. The pendulum swung between them, notably with Vettel’s victory in Canada where Hamilton had won the previous three meetings. Then in Austria Mercedes once again called Hamilton’s strategy wrongly before further woe when he was forced to retire with a fuel problem.With Ferrari stronger than ever, there was a palpable sense that the fearsome Mercedes machine was being tested to breaking point. Worse was to follow as upgrades the Scuderia brought to Silverstone gave them a pace advantage and Vettel romped home joyously.However the German’s costly error in crashing at Hockenheim and Hamilton’s mighty qualifying lap in Hungary ensured he took wins against head at the next two rounds. Ferrari’s riposte in Belgium was ferocious. Spa was a Mercedes track but the Scuderia took their car and engine advantage to a new level with Vettel’s comprehensive win, leaving their rivals reeling.It was the team’s “most difficult moment”, explained the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff. “Realising before the summer and at Spa that Ferrari had a better development in performance,” he said.The setback was a call to arms. “It is the mindset of seeking perfection,” Wolff said. “The days we lose are the ones our competitors should fear because it is when we learn the most – this happened at Spa.”They had already proved resilient on track, matching poor pitwall calls with some superb decisions in Baku, Hockenheim and Hungary. Off track after Belgium they had to find answers to their problems – tyres blistering and poor traction out of slow corners. Wolff explained that far from panicking or condemnation he sent a message of encouragement to his staff the next day. “In this email, I said: ‘We are not giving up,’” he recalled. “This is not a championship we are going to lose. We need to understand why we have been outperformed. So it was development, research, analysis, mindset, work ethic and fun.”He believes this was fundamental to the success that followed. “It is important when under immense pressure to be kind in your analysis of your weaknesses,” he said. “The best warriors are the ones that are kind in times of great conflict. How you behave under pressure, how you are able to stick to your values and your mindset in times of peace. This is when the true ability of people is going to be proven.”The approach proved hugely successful. With Hamilton hitting his best and Mercedes having worked through and solved their issues, they won the following four races and all but secured the title, in a remarkable turnaround.Ferrari and Vettel’s mistakes would have proved costly against any opponent but when they needed to step up they were faced with a team and driver who had found an entire new level. They were made to look almost amateurish in the face of Mercedes’ slick professionalism.That the atmosphere at Mercedes is wholly constructive had been demonstrated earlier in the season when the chief strategist, James Vowles, apologised over the radio to Hamilton for their poor call in Austria. It demonstrated just how comfortable the team are in admitting errors and learning from them rather than finger pointing. It stood in stark contrast to Ferrari’s principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, launching a scathing attack on his own team after their qualifying blunder in Japan.There was calm then, even at the heart of the maelstrom at Mercedes. “In those difficult moments the trust remains,” Wolff said. “Lewis does not question the ability of the team but he relies on what he has seen in the past the team has done. That deep relationship of trust is fundamental between the driver and the team.”If Hamilton should take the title on Sunday there is no doubt the first thing he will do is thank his team. Nor should this be seen as PR platitudes merely for public consumption. “We win and lose together” has long been his mantra. This season they have done both and Mercedes have emerged stronger than ever. They are the benchmark against which all others must be measured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b7b67b02a15fdf62621d7c1a2553f553c459c41/0_53_3880_2328/master/3880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61d7edf2ee7357eada4cc75b48a6a298","title":"jake polledri gloucester munster","story":"Gloucester’s Jake Polledri, who faces Munster this weekend, is a flanker who slipped through England’s fingersTalent-spotting is not an exact science, particularly in rugby. Some players develop late or fail to tick the obvious physical boxes, others are crowded out, not least in England, by the sheer weight of numbers. How many hidden gems might have worn the red rose had they not been injured at the wrong moment, been given more time to mature or been born in a different postcode?For whatever reason, the number of good players slipping through England’s fingers seems to be rising. This week, in addition to Christian Wade’s abrupt switch to American Football, Exeter’s Sam Skinner has declared for Scotland having previously represented England U20s. In the summer Sale’s Mike Haley, previously a contender for a full England cap, decamped to Munster. On Saturday he faces Gloucester’s Jake Polledri, perhaps the best current example of what English rugby is missing out on.Imagine if Polledri, on the strength of his Italian grandparents, had not already been snapped up by the alert Conor O’Shea. How England, given their back-row injury problems, could presently do with a young, energetic and versatile flanker who breaks tackles almost every time he carries the ball.As Munster will discover at Thomond Park, what the 22-year-old Polledri lacks in experience he makes up for in bullocking power and heart.Maybe that is partly where English rugby is going wrong. It has so many sleek gym rats from which to choose that it does not always prioritise ticker, desire and natural-born mongrel. In Polledri’s case the catalyst was being rejected by his home city club Bristol as a teenager. “I was under the impression they were going to sign me but in the end they turned round and said: ‘If we sign you, you’re going to be pretty low down the pecking order.’ As a young kid that’s where you expect to be but, ultimately, they just said: ‘No.’”Given his father Pete played 466 games for the club it was a substantial body-blow for all concerned. “Knowing how many games my dad played for Bristol there’s always been a drive to play rugby but it was a knock to be told ‘no’ at a young age by Bristol. In hindsight, though, it was probably a good thing. It spurred me on even more.”And so began a story that should serve as encouragement to everyone to follow their dreams. Polledri, who had been playing locally with Dings Crusaders, was offered a place at Hartpury College while also working for his father who owns a long-established family sandwich bar in Bristol as well as a couple of Subway franchises.He duly caught Gloucester’s eye but as recently as last October had still not made his Premiership debut. Only when Ed Slater injured a finger in the warm-up before playing Northampton did he finally get his big chance, at approximately 10 minutes’ notice. “I got the phone call while I was in the media room stealing a bacon roll. They said: ‘You’ve got to be on the bench’ and found me a pair of boots and a gumshield. I got on for 10 minutes at the end and that’s where it all kicked off.”Barely three months later he found himself being included in Italy’s squad for the Six Nations, having previously represented Italy U20s. He made his debut against Scotland and scored his first international try, a typically barnstorming effort against Japan in Kobe in June, much to the joy of his paternal grandmother Luisa, now in her 90s, who emigrated from Italy as a teenager and met her late husband when both of them worked in the same ice-cream factory in south Wales.For the entire family the sight of Jake playing Test rugby in a blue jersey outweighed any faint regret that, aside from a run-out for England Counties, he is not representing the land of his birth.“Dad was just happy I’d taken all the opportunities I’d been given. If I hadn’t taken the decision to play for Italy I probably wouldn’t have played any internationals last year. He flew out to Japan to watch one of the games this summer. That’s how much he wants to see me play.”The moral of the story? Unexpected success tastes even sweeter than pre-ordained progression. Until two months ago Polledri was still helping his father with his business book-keeping he also has clear memories of working shifts from 8am to 1am in Subway as emergency staff cover. Could it be that devouring endless filled rolls transformed his rugby? “I’d love to say there was a secret. When I was working in Subway I was certainly eating a lot of them. If people want to see if that works they can try it out. On those long shifts I’d probably eat four or five. They’re not small. Other than that I haven’t really got an answer. It’s just a case of head down and run.”Those in charge of him at Gloucester, however, insist he is being overly modest. “He’s one of those players I take my hat off to,” confirms Johan Ackermann, the head coach at Gloucester, who defeated Castres last Sunday. “It would have been easy, having achieved what he has done, to take your foot off the pedal and say: ‘I’m probably close to first choice now.’ But he came back from his summer break in even better condition than when I arrived at the club.“The reality is that people start looking at you, analysing your strengths and working out plans for you. It’s easy to surprise everyone and have a great first season. The challenge for him is to do the same in his second season. If you watch him off the ball he’s working much harder now.”No one will ever know how Polledri, or indeed the impressive Skinner, might have fared in an England squad context but, come the Six Nations, Eddie Jones may yet be forcibly reminded of what he turned down.Polledri, one of only two Italian Test players involved in the Champions Cup’s opening round, is rather more preoccupied with measuring himself against Munster’s Lions, Peter O’Mahony and CJ Stander, but is happy to be a standard-bearer for anyone who endures rejection at a tender age.“There are a lot of people out there who probably don’t get picked up. It’s just about opportunities, being in the right place at the right time and having the drive to do it.” England’s loss is very much Italy’s gain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1023c68f846a0c792e49c850e79e1067f39e77c5/0_86_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9428177245a5399f3764380b96daf3b8","title":"lizzie deignan interview motherhood cycling return","story":"There are three of us in this interview, and in the best of ways. As Lizzie Deignan details her pregnancy and her hopes and plans for her cycling future from a half-complete house in Yorkshire, her new-born daughter Orla is cooing and chirping in that engaging way newborns have. She is, Deignan tells me, very calm, does not cry much, “not much fazes her”, and at four weeks she appears to be taking this little episode in her stride.Three years after winning the road race world championships in Richmond, Philadelphia, with her 30th birthday on the horizon, Deignan has taken on a different challenge, with the support of her husband Philip and a new team, Trek Segafredo: doing it all again as a mother, with the goal of more world championship success when the title race comes to her home roads next year, and that elusive Olympic gold medal in Tokyo a year later.Deignan kept fans up to date with her pregnancy through Instagram, but relished the quiet of the period out of racing that followed her announcement in March. “Personally and professionally it’s been a nice year away from the pressures of sport. It’s made me realise how lucky I am to do what I do. I’d got stale and felt I was just going through the motions, so I’m pleased to have a second chance of approaching my career.”The decision to come back to racing after the birth of her daughter came early in her pregnancy. She had hitherto assumed motherhood would be “an all-encompassing thing, that when you became a mother that should be your sole focus. I had no plan to come back afterwards, but about a month in I realised that was what I wanted to do, and that I might be capable of doing both, and that it might inspire other women.“It’s a genuine motivation. As an athlete you have to promote stuff, communicate about things, but this is different. I just genuinely feel you should encourage people to try to have it all.”Deignan kept riding until three days before Orla’s birth on 24 September, and was intrigued to discover what she could do so late into her pregnancy. “The first three months were the hardest because of morning sickness and tiredness, but I’d have laughed if you had told me I would keep riding until then. It was good for my physical and mental health, keeping moving was important, keeping the swelling down. Every woman is different but I was surprised by what we are capable of.”Presenting her Lizzie x Santini clothing range at the recent CycleExpo in Harrogate was a rare public outing for the 2012 London silver medallist. She has no set date in her head for a return to racing, which is deliberate, to ensure that she does not put herself under pressure. “I wanted to be cautious, because the goal is the Yorkshire Worlds. I haven’t got to race until June so I’ve got a good amount of time, although it’s possible it may be earlier.”That date has been agreed with a new squad, Trek-Segafredo, who stepped in after Deignan left her long-time team Boels-Dolmans in the spring following the announcement of her pregnancy. “All I have had from Trek about my comeback is positive enthusiasm, there is no judgment on me as a mother. They thought it was an excellent opportunity and it would encourage other mothers to ride their bikes.”Trek will be run alongside the men’s WorldTour team of the same name. It is not a novelty, but it is increasingly the norm, with Movistar and FDJ recently following the early adopter Sunweb. Some say it should be obligatory for all WorldTour teams, but Deignan is not sure. “It shouldn’t be the only model, because there are standalone women’s teams doing a great job. But we are lucky to have the infrastructure of the men’s team, so we can use that without needing a huge budget.”It is unclear as yet how she and husband Philip, 35, will manage childcare, largely because his future is currently more uncertain than his wife’s. “The original plan was that he would keep racing as well, but men’s racing is having a turbulent time. He’s looking for a contract but he may end up as a full-time dad as his next career move. We’ve looked into other arrangements such as childcare and we’re ready for both options.”Deignan’s big target for 2019 is 11 months away, when Yorkshire, the county where she was born, hosts the world road race championships. The course, she says, is, “awesome”.She adds: “If I could design a circuit like the one in Harrogate, it would be like that. There are two bottlenecks, chicanes, you come down both descents on to humpback bridges over a stream and back up the other side of the valley. It’s very hard, very good, with lots of places to launch attacks. It’s great for racing.”She has few concerns about the scale of what she is taking on. “I have no doubt it will be a serious challenge but I’m excited by that. I wasn’t very happy with my racing before, if you are winning you are expected to be happy but I’d fallen out of love with it. Now I have a second chance to enjoy it.“I’d rather try and fail than not try. I’m absolutely prepared to fail but I will have to decide what failure is. I’ve not really considered it.“I’ve got two years to do it, and so far I’ve only surprised myself. If the worst happens and I don’t win bike races I’ve got Orla, so it won’t be a big deal.”For now, she is waiting until what feels the right moment to get back on two wheels she is determined not to rush into it. “I’m looking forward to my first ride. I feel very balanced about it. I love Orla to bits but I’m sure I’ll be fine for an hour on the bike.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4076a991fdb8e2861b43f68554d202081ac98739/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64bdb7f3331eec31dd3af4380ae9fb57","title":"zak hardaker rehab drink driving wigan","story":"• Warriors stand by full-back, saying they have ‘duty of care’ • Hardaker yet to play for club because of ban for cocaine useWigan have announced that Zak Hardaker will remain with the Super League champions in 2019 despite pleading guilty to a drink-driving charge last week – but the full-back will undergo alcohol rehabilitation treatment with the Sporting Chance Clinic in an attempt to salvage his career.Hardaker was given a 20-month driving ban after being stopped by police in September, only days after beginning training with the Warriors, when he was more than twice over the legal limit. He is currently serving a 14-month ban from playing after testing positive for cocaine last year but, under UK Anti-Doping regulations, was allowed to start training before the ban’s completion.The drink-driving incident put his future with Wigan in doubt but the Warriors have insisted they will not terminate the 27-year-old’s contract, instead deciding to send him on a “period of treatment for his relationship with alcohol”. That involves a residential stay at Sporting Chance.In a statement Wigan’s owner, Ian Lenagan, said: “Firstly, I’d like to make clear that we are extremely disappointed with Zak’s actions on the evening of 26 September. Drink driving is completely unacceptable, and we are pleased the matter has been dealt with by the courts so firmly.“It would be easy for us to cut our losses with Zak and deny him the opportunity to play for Wigan but we are not going to do that. Our duty of care as employers is to help Zak address the fundamental problems that he has had for some time – issues that we believe could and should have been confronted already. Zak will enter a residential facility in the coming weeks and how he commits during this course will not only define his rugby career but potentially set him on a more productive path for the rest of his life.”Hardaker said: “I’d like to wholeheartedly apologise for my actions. The first thing I need to accept is that I have a problem and I’ll be throwing all my efforts into sorting that out. I’d like to thank Wigan for supporting me through this and I will do everything I can to repay their faith in me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc836c2c964f0791d9871c94a52c8222275286b6/557_686_2564_1539/master/2564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad18b7d1b9f16ce28b4a639ac8e3b685","title":"dimitris papaioannou le patin libre dance umbrella","story":"Dimitris Papaioannou’s show at Dance Umbrella is a painterly piece that leaves little to the imagination, while Le Patin Libre deliver a haunting show on iceLondon’s Dance Umbrella festival has a knack for programming artists who seem to inhabit genres of their own, like Le Patin Libre’s contemporary ice-skating (more of which later) and the Greek choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou’s distinctive stripped-back dance-theatre.Papaioannou made his debut at Dance Umbrella two years ago and is still relatively unfamiliar to UK audiences, but he has been making dance for 30 years and it shows. The craftsmanship is immense and this is an accomplished piece of theatre that creates so much from very little. The stage is an empty slope covered in large black tiles, and contrast is everywhere: dark versus light, black clothes versus pale naked flesh. Quite a lot of naked flesh, as it happens. (Be prepared for penises.) The Great Tamer (★★★★☆) is a work that spins its magic so slowly it seems as if barely anything is happening, but then the 10 dancers suddenly coalesce into a striking scene, a small coup de theatre, something funny or recognisable, mostly imitations of great paintings. Rembrandt’s The Anatomy Lesson appears, for example, the dancers with stiff ruffs around their necks and a body on the slab having its sausagey innards pulled out.There’s a fleeting crucifixion, a flag waver (Delacroix’s Liberty, perhaps?), a wheat-carrying Grecian goddess (Demeter?), a transcendental moment when golden arrows swoop in graceful flight and rain down on the stage. Also an astronaut – admittedly not such a popular theme for the old masters.The work often has one eyebrow raised, there’s knowing optical illusion and almost slapstick physical jokes, which makes the few disturbing moments all the more shocking: a naked woman lying on the ground, a man rolling up his sleeve pushing his fist under her ribs. It’s not at all explicit but it’s seriously uncomfortable.That scene jolts because mostly this is a stage adrift from a sense of place, character, context, judgment, relationships. It’s limbo. Wonderful things materialise and then disappear, without purpose or consequence, and yet it’s thoroughly engaging because it’s so masterfully done (although it could definitely lose 20 minutes). It is at once momentous and meaningless, everything and nothing. And that’s the power of art: you make something meaningful by committing it to canvas, by bringing it into existence, and by crafting materials you craft cultures.There is magic in Le Patin Libre’s shows, too. The French-Canadian figure skaters make a new brand of contemporary ice dance, all based on the ghostly glide, the ability to move at great speed while the body remains still.What’s so mesmerising is the way the dynamics of the movement and the group morph while maintaining the unbroken thread of the glide. They swell, flow, accelerate, stretch and contract the space between their bodies. They switch from legato to marcato. It’s hugely musical to watch. Their feet trace intricate patterns on the ice, but often it’s the simplest moments that are the most arresting, as the five skaters very beautifully just slide backwards and forwards, hypnotic as a swinging pocket watch.This latest work, Threshold (★★★★☆), brings a new level of emotion. Not a narrative but fleeting glimpses and fragments: moments of conflict between bodies clashing or dodging each other the push-pull of a couple warily, or wearily, circling each other a lone body left on the ice.What they’re lacking is a stronger sense of the overall shape. The second half could do with more propulsion and, musically, the moody minor string soundtrack is muted and repetitive.

The law, brought in by state Republicans after Democrat Heidi Heitkamp won a tight US Senate race in 2012, requires voters to present identification that includes a current residential address.It has been challenged by a collective of Native American voters who argue the law will disproportionately disenfranchise the state’s 30,000 American Indians many of who live on reservations without standard addresses.The North Dakota Senate race, between Heitkamp and Republican Kevin Cramer, is one of the most pivotal battles in the Democrats’ bid to retake the US Senate. Heitkamp is already significantly behind, recent polls indicate, after she voted against Donald Trump’s supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.It was revealed earlier in the month that the Georgia secretary of state, Brian Kemp, had held back at least 53,000 voter registration applications, the majority from African American voters, with just days before the state’s registration deadline.Kemp is the Republican nominee for governor in one of the most closely watched gubernatorial elections in country. He is facing Democrat Stacey Abrams who could become America’s first black female governor if elected.Last week Kemp was sued by a collective of civil rights groups who argue the state’s “exact match” laws, which require personal information on voter applications – such as driver’s license numbers to precisely match state databases, are simply a way of suppressing the vote.This week, two lawsuits were filed after the state’s most erse county\u0026nbsprejected an unusually large share of absentee ballots.Missouri is among those states to have introduced voter ID laws since the 2016 presidential elections, which are currently being challenged in court by democratic leaning advocacy groups.Last week a senior state judge scolded Missouri’s Republican secretary of state for publishing misleading advertisements about the new law, which falsely suggested voters would need photo ID to cast their ballot, and blocked him from publishing any more. The ruling was a small victory for voting rights advocates who have challenged the law’s broader constitutionality.In what could become one of the most significant votes in the history of this swing state, Floridians will also decide in November on whether to automatically restore the franchise to former felons.Florida is one of just three states in the US that permanently disenfranchises ex-criminals and requires them to personally petition the government to get their rights restored. Over 1.5 million people in Florida have lost the franchise due to this law – by far the largest number of former felons to be disqualified in any state in America.In Ohio the bid to curtail the state’s aggressive voter purges – which require iniduals who have not cast a ballot in two years to resubmit documentation to vote – was dealt another blow earlier in the month. Last week a federal judge ruled that elements of the process were constitutional. Earlier in the year, in a 5-4 ruling, the US supreme court had upheld other elements of the process.In Arkansas, another state to introduce voter ID laws since Trump’s victory, the state’s supreme court reversed a lower court ruling, meaning the law would take effect for the first time during elections next month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dca753489f90c4103db800369c3e293b113d6f9/0_141_4661_2798/master/4661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21fd6ec28fd2b9e97f639f9e5bba90e4","title":"wisconsin midterm elections scott walker democrats chances divided state","story":"There are two Racines: a richer, whiter county and a poorer, more erse city. Which will weigh heavier at the ballot box in crucial midterm elections for House, Senate and governor?When I checked in at Heathrow for my flight to Racine the woman helping me tag my bags asked the purpose of my journey. When I told her I was going to cover the midterm elections she asked: “Do you think it’ll make any difference. He just does what he wants.” Then she leaned in conspiratorially and whispered. “I think he’s mad.”When I later told the American immigration officer at Chicago O’Hare about my plans he sighed: “Oh, it’s time for that circus again!” and waved me through. At the car rental counter the assistant just laughed. “I won’t tell you what I think,” she said, shaking her head. “I’m not sure I even have the words.”The 90-minute drive from O’Hare to Racine is a straight run from suburb to farmland from Illinois (“Land of Lincoln”) to Wisconsin (“America’s Dairyland”) until you reach the county road and then head east past fields of pumpkin and corn to Lake Michigan. Racine sits on the western banks of the lake – a former manufacturing town which, at first sight, seems to have managed better than most such places. Evidence of its post-industrial status abounds in former factory buildings and manufacturing sites but many have been repurposed. Downsized but not derelict, it’s a rust belt town without too much rust.“It’s a working-class town where there’s not a lot of work,” says Angelina Cruz, a teacher and union organiser. “And the work there is tends to be service work that doesn’t pay well and doesn’t have great benefits.”“We have two Racines,” says Kelly Gallaher, a retired teacher. “We have a beautiful place to live and wonderful, wonderful people. We’re 25 minutes from Milwaukee and an hour on the train from Chicago. We have great ersity. But when you look under it you see that there are problems we’re not addressing. You can find yourself a job, but it’ll pay $9 an hour and at the same time there’s no housing to buy and no housing to rent. Wisconsin has the worst achievement gap between black and white children in the country and Racine is up there in the top three cities within Wisconsin.”Over the summer Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) launched a series of raids that led to detention of several local people, including Ricardo Fierro, the former local director of the Hiic Chamber of Commerce and member of the City of Racine mayoral advisory board.Racine faces three elections, all of which have national interest. The current congressman is the Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan: he is stepping down and Democrats have an outside chance of taking his seat. In a year with a record number of female candidates two women, Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir, are running for the Senate. Baldwin, the sitting Democratic senator, appears to have a strong lead, but Republicans have not yet given up. And in the governor’s race the Republican Scott Walker, whose attacks on public sector workers over the last eight years made him a poster boy for Conservatives and a hate-figure for progressives, is in an extremely tight race. Bernie Sanders is coming to campaign in nextdoor Kenosha next week Donald Trump will be holding a rally a few hours away too.But during the drive through the county and into the city there are very few yard signs in the city there are not many posters. It may well be that people are momentarily captivated by the fate of the Milwaukee Brewers in the baseball playoffs, but three weeks from election day the political intensity of the last two years is not immediately apparent.Midterm elections are strange affairs. Votes to the lower house (the House of Representatives) and a third of the upper house (the Senate) can have a considerable impact on how much of a president’s agenda can be achieved. But they are far more low key than presidential contests. The turnout is always lower and interest slower to catch on. I recall asking people on the Las Vegas Strip their thoughts the weekend before the 2006 midterms and discovering most didn’t know they were even happening.But the only way you could avoid them in Racine is if the only things you watched were streamed through the likes of Netflix or Amazon Prime. Regular TV is awash with ads. Most are negative. In the local race, James Bryce tells people not to vote for his Democratic brother Randy, which has prompted their mother to call for the ad to be taken down. At the governor level, Walker’s supporters are running ads criticizing his opponent for not revoking the license of a teacher caught watching porn on his school computer. One ad focuses in on a teenage girl’s chest and refers to oral sex while featuring school students.In a recent campaign call local Republican activists were told the races were extremely close and there was everything to play for. Democrats have been told the same thing. But burned by Donald Trump’s election in the state – Wisconsin had not voted Republican since 1984 and nobody I have spoken to saw it coming even as they were campaigning on the day – and their failed attempts to get rid of Walker, Democrats dare not hope too much. Anecdotally they sense people are more engaged than they can remember since Obama’s election. Emotionally, thanks to recurring disappointments, they have ceased to fully trust their senses.“I’ve been doing this every cycle since 2006,” says Gallaher, a Democrat. “The closer you get to election day it starts to tighten and it gets closer and closer and when it comes down to it Republicans will turn out and Democrats won’t. My hope is that all the things that have happened over the last two years will make a difference and bring people out. But having been active as long as I have in Wisconsin, I can’t afford the luxury of hope any longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9286ca0079b40d2ea32bbeb116681e7de0159562/0_0_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ecaeeaadca305e428b6b5e0521647c","title":"sagrada familia gets building licence 136 years after work began","story":"Church agrees to pay €22m to fund transport upgrades under deal with Barcelona councilMore than a century after its first stone was laid and 92 years after its famously ascetic architect was fatally struck by a tram, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona is finally getting its paperwork in order.A deal between the church’s trustees and the city council means the project, on which construction began in 1882, will be granted a building licence for the first time.Antoni Gaudí’s unfinished masterpiece is Barcelona’s most visited tourist site, attracting 20 million visitors to the area each year. But until Thursday it had lacked the proper permissions.The new agreement will formalise the building works and pave the way for a plan “to study the urban solutions in order to finish Antoni Gaudí’s project”, the city council said.The deal includes schemes to improve public transport and the surrounding area. The Sagrada Familia will pay €22m (£19.3m) to help underwrite the city’s transport network, including €7m to improve accessibility on the Barcelona metro system. Four million euros will be invested in renovating four major thoroughfares and €3m will be for keeping streets safe and clean.“The Sagrada Familia is an icon and the most visited monument in our city,” the Barcelona mayor, Ada Colau, said in a tweet. “After two years of dialogue we have made an agreement that will guarantee the payment of the licence, secure access to the monument and facilitate local life with improvements to public transport and redevelopment of the nearby streets.”Work on the Sagrada Familia began in March 1882, based on a neo-gothic design by the architect Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano. When he resigned shortly afterwards, Gaudí stepped in with perhaps his most famously idiosyncratic design.The church quickly became the life’s work of the Catalan architect. He oversaw construction between 1883 and early June 1926, when he was hit by a tram. He succumbed to his injuries three days later and was buried, fittingly, in a chapel in the Sagrada Familia’s crypt.Gaudí’s collaborator Domènec Sugrañes took over the project, adhering to Gaudí’s original concept. During the Spanish civil war the studio workshop burned down and original plans, drawings, photographs and models were destroyed, but the work went on.With luck it will finish in eight years’ time – the centenary of Gaudí’s death and a mere 143 years after it began.

According to a report in the , Sky in the UK has written to television providers in the US giving them a deadline of the end of the year to resolve post-Brexit licensing plans or risk being taken off its service.The letter says Sky needs details of its channel partner’s licensing plans to make sure it adheres to European broadcasting regulations in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Many US media companies including Discovery, Disney, the MTV owner Viacom, and WarnerMedia’s Turner have European broadcasting hubs in the UK and operate under British licences, which means they can broadcast across the EU.However, if the British government does not reach a deal to keep EU-wide broadcast rights post-Brexit, these companies may have to relocate parts of their businesses as well as their TV licensing arrangements to other EU countries so they can continue to transmit across the rest of Europe. Channels that use Sky’s UK service would then need two licences to continue to legally broadcast in both the UK and Ireland with companies who do not get such licences unable to be legally aired in Ireland by Sky UK.Discovery, which is the biggest broadcaster to use the UK as a hub with licences for more than 100 TV channels has been looking at locations for a second European licensing and broadcasting hub in the event of no deal. Ireland is one option although Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Estonia and Malta are also seen as contenders.Industry souurces played down the risk Irish viewers will lose access to channels and described the letter sent by the company as an “administrative exercise” designed to make broadcasters aware that, if there is a no deal scenario, then they’ll need to make sure they are covered to broadcast in both the UK and Europe.The  contacted Sky and a spokeswoman said the company “continually work with our partner channels to ensure they have the licences they need to broadcast.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The council published research earlier this year examining the structure, curriculum and assessment methods used in senior cycle across nine jurisdictions, including Finland and Ontario in Canada. The research showed a wide variation in approach across these countries, although most tended to have more popular pathways into vocational routes than in Ireland. Ireland currently has the highest proportion of school-leavers in the EU who progress to third level. By contrast, far fewer students here pursue apprenticeships or traineeships.Ms Keane also told the conference that schools remain underfunded and that austerity-era cuts to funding levels per student have yet to be fully reversed.She also called on the Government to end parents “voluntary contributions” and to replace then with adequate State funding.“In an ideal world, every school would receive the funding necessary to realise its educational goals,” she said.“Perhaps the time is finally here, Minister, to consider abolition of voluntary contributions – and to call on the Department of Finance to provide the finding schools so richly deserve.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3669244.1539958493!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers overseas may be interviewed for jobs at home via skype","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe McHugh, the newly appointed Minister for Education, said thousands of teachers are based in places like Dubai or Abu Dhabi and many feel unable to fly back to Ireland for job interviews. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Schools may be encouraged to interview Irish teachers based in the Middle East over Skype as part of a new effort to tackle classroom staff shortages.Joe McHugh, the newly appointed Minister for Education, said thousands of teachers are based in places like Dubai or Abu Dhabi and many feel unable to fly back to Ireland for job interviews.Mr McHugh - a former teacher who worked for a time in the United Arab Emirates - said overseas teachers could play a key role in addressing the ongoing staff shortages.“I think back to my own time there. You do feel you’re a good bit away from home and you feel you’re out of sight, out of mind. If there are creative ways to make it easier for them - be it interviews or Skyping interviews - I think that’s a possibility,” he said.He was speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals in Galway on Friday, which heard that many secondary schools are struggling with a shortage of qualified teachers for key positions. Mary Keane, the association’s president, said many schools do not have qualified teachers this year in key subjects such as Irish, European languages, science and home economics.She said the “crisis” had reached a point where more affluent parents were opting to move their children to grind schools. This, in turn, she said, was widening the socio-economic ide between the haves and have-nots.Mr McHugh said the Department of Foreign Affairs could also have a role in spreading awareness of vacancies or initiatives to attract teachers home.The Minister, who formally took over the role on Wednesday, also said he was aware that many teachers and principals have a growing sense of “initiative overload”.Mr McHugh said he was conscious of the time pressures facing the profession and said he will “take stock” of the Government’s action plan to see “what’s working, and what’s not working”. He also acknowledged that schools need more certainty over the payment of grants for renovations, which are typically paid at the end of the year and during the summer.The Minister pledged to ensure summer works funding would be available every summer over the coming years, while minor grants will be made before Christmas.“I said it yesterday and I think all the red buttons in the Department of Education went off when I said we would do it before Christmas - but that’s the commitment.”He also pledged that a €60 million grant to upgrade ICT equipment will be paid out to schools in January of next year.“That’s another red button that has gone off in Marlborough Street - I’ll be the shortest minister of education,” he joked."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3669326.1539963870!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and beyond eu ready to move on even if britain cannot","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            European Council president Donald Tusk and Britain’s prime minister Theresa May talk after a group photo-opportunity  in Brussels.

They’ll be in the frontline of taking back control, when it happens. You’d wonder are they ready for it.“Brussels wants an even more craven surrender from Theresa May tonight,” thunders the Sun, free for British Airways travellers. “Are they for real?”On a Brussels-bound British Airways flight, passengers can see the white cliffs of Dover, though it’s too far to see if there are blue birds over them. However, those same passengers could easily see the volume of shipping traffic across the channel below – ships carrying the billions of pounds and euro of trade between the UK and the Europe.From Germany they carry Mercedes and BMWs and Audis and Volkswagens to one of their most important markets. Brexiteers insisted that the German government – at the behest of its massive car industry – would insist that the EU rushed to make a trade deal on favourable terms with Brexit Britain.So far, they have misunderstood how important the EU is to Germany – it is the vehicle (sorry) for preserving the post-war settlement in Europe and avoiding a repeat of the catastrophes of the last century. That has been the greatest priority of every generation of German politicians since the war, and they are willing to sacrifice anything to preserve it, do anything to defend it. Germany loves selling cars to the UK. But it is not more important to it than protecting the EU.Now British car manufacturers warn they will move abroad, or stall production if there is a no-deal Brexit. The Brexiteers respond by telling car industry bosses how to run their businesses.On the BA flight, the sachets of milk come from Lakeland dairies in Killeshandra, Co Cavan. The milk has probably crossed the Border several times.Theresa May had been invited to speak to her 27 non-Brexiting colleagues for 30 minutes before the summit dinner on Wednesday evening. In the event, she spoke for 15 minutes, stressing that she believed a deal was possible, pledged that the UK would work to achieve one, and sought compromise and co-operation from the EU side. EU leaders, officials said, listened respectfully. Everyone wanted to avoid a repeat of the Salzburg summit last month, when May was sent away with a flea in her ear, to subsequent outrage in London.This time the leaders, and the vast entourage of officials, handlers, diplomats and spin-doctors that accompanies them, ensured that the mood music was more harmonious. But turn off the music and it was clear that the EU leader believed that progress was slow and unsatisfactory. When Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, finished his presentation to the leaders, they banged the table in approval and appreciation.Theresa May said her piece and left, and EU leaders then discussed the Brexit talks – including, according to several informed sources, the difficulties faced by May in getting a deal approved by her party and her parliament, though on record questions are met with official denials. But as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar acknowledged at his summit press conference the following day, “We’re all politicians.” They can also all read the papers. They understand the pressure May is under. But their view is: that’s her problem. Safeguarding the EU’s interests is ours.The Taoiseach also brought a copy of that day’s  into the meeting, showing it to his fellow diners to underscore Ireland’s real concerns about the trouble a return of any border could present. This is what happened the last time we had customs posts in Ireland,” he told them.“Despicable, low and rotten,” responded Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP. “Scraping the bottom of the barrel.”But it made everyone in Brussels sit up and take notice.In the round of press conferences that followed the summit’s principal session on Thursday, EU leaders seemed weary of answering questions about Brexit. “That question is too complicated to for me,” said Donald Tusk wearily at one point during his conference with Jean Claude Juncker, the Commission chief. “I think it’s for Jean Claude.”Earlier Tusk had compared the Brexit negotiations with unravelling the Gordian Knot. But the Knot wasn’t unravelled. Alexander the Great cut it with his sword. A swift cutting of the cord is what the hard Brexiteers desire. Theresa May, conscious of the extreme economic dislocation it would cause, strains for a deal. Michel Barnier says they need more time to work it out. But time is getting short, and patience is wearing thin.A vast and energetic British press corps interrogated every angle, every nugget of information, rumour and supposition, every leak, every dead end.They swarmed around one senior official who delivered an impromptu briefing in the atrium of the conference venue. Were leaders concerned about the DUP? That’s a matter for Theresa May. Would the UK have to continue paying into the EU budget if the transition was extended? We haven’t even considered that yet. Was May standing up when she spoke? No, she was sitting down. Did leaders roll their eyes when she spoke? Not at all. Were the leaders sitting more closely together, or farther apart? What? Come on, pleaded one, I’ve to get 500 words out of this.The truth is Europe is moving on from Brexit. It’s got other things going on. EU leaders are getting impatient – they want a deal done, says one senior official. Many of them don’t care all that much what’s in the deal. They just want it done. A source who was briefed on the dinner says that only 11 of the leaders spoke during the discussion about Brexit.The British – and the Irish, if the truth be told – are understandably fixated on Brexit to a degree that is not replicated in the rest of Europe. The summit discussed other issues – migration, security, Eurozone reform, the Italian budget – that many EU countries believe are more important than Brexit. The British don’t seem to understand this.On Friday morning, as Asian leaders arrived for the EU-Asia summit, a British journalist shouted questions. The Indian vice-president Venkaiah Naidu emerged from his car and proceeded at a stately pace across the red carpet towards the entrance. “Are you going to do a trade deal with Britain after Brexit?” the journalist cried “What do you think of Brexit, sir?”If there is an Indian look that conveys “I don’t give a crap about Brexit”, Naidu was wearing it just them. He continued without answering. Standing by, an EU official watched the scene and muttered half to himself.“They think the whole world is fixated on Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies.

Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  President Michael D Higgins has defended the amount he is spending on his election campaign, the number of public engagements he has fulfilled and his expenses, a week before polling day. In a wide-ranging interview he also defended the turnover of Áras an Uachtaráin staff under his presidency, his failure to address the houses of the Oireachtas and his decision to run for the office again having said that he would serve only one term.President Higgins said he had not reneged “on a solemn promise” in relation to running for a second term. The only solemn promise he had made was “when I had the book in my hand” during his swearing in ceremony. He had changed his mind following requests from people that he stand again, he said. “I mentioned that to you two years ago at the ploughing (championships),” he said on RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke Show on Friday. “I said I think I may change my mind. I am responding to requests to stand.”He said he started his campaign with his own resources and donations and did not accept any money from political parties. He anticipated that the amount for the campaign will be between €360,000 to €390,000 and is within Standards in Public Office (Sipo) guidelines.Mr Higgins rejected claims that the number of engagements he has fulfilled was fewer than his predecessor. He said that the claim had been made by one of the other candidates who was indulging in “American style black advertisements” using false figures.On the issue of spending for the office of president, he said that the Comptroller and Auditor General signs off on accounts, but he believes that spending should be accounted in a more transparent and thoughtful way. He has proposals for an independent audit committee, but he would make changes that would affect not just him, but other future incumbents, he said. Mr Higgins wants a comment from the independent audit committee to be included in the annual Arás report “because we do much in the Arás, I don’t think we tell our story well.”“People want to know who is coming to the Arás? Who is visiting the Arás, where is the President going?”When asked about the high turn over of staff, he said that people made changes in their careers and he did not place any limit on people’s ambitions. “I am very happy with my staff.”Mr Higgins said his decision not to address the Houses of the Oireachtas was made as he wondered where he could make the best contribution, which was why he had addressed the European Parliament. He had gone with the theme that if one is going to make an economic decision that falls on social groups, then one must take responsibility. “I have a modus operandi that I don’t interfere in the legislative process,” he said.He defended his recent pre-Budget comments on social spending and tax cuts, saying he did not think he had “put a toe over the line.” He meets with the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar every six weeks to discuss topics they both bring to the table and he feels the meetings are “very fruitful” for both of them, he said. On being asked if he had met more people than his predecessors, Mr Higgins said he had but that he did it in more flexible ways. He is going to approach the next seven years with even greater enthusiasm, he said.

File photograph: Vincent KesslerReutersIf there’s one man who enjoys a European summit, it’s Nigel Farage MEP, erstwhile leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip), and The Man Who Made Brexit.Farage is in his element over here, conducting an unending series of interviews in the cavernous five-storey atrium of the Justus Lipsius building, temporary home to the several hundred visiting journalists.He flits from camera to camera, microphone to microphone, dispensing his signature brand of wit, bluster, triumphalism and warnings to “get on with it, Mrs May!” to a dizzying array of interviewers, foreign and domestic.During lulls in media engagements, he stands at the entrance to the hall, inviting further attention – which arrives, inevitably, before much time has elapsed. On Thursday he was also being followed about by a dedicated television crew who seemed to be filming a day in the life of Nigel, or something. (Watch out for it.)Nigel’s TV crew spend the morning filming him being filmed by his interviewers.His only break from constant media duty is an intermittent dash to the smoking cabin for gaspers and muttered confidences to his Irish confidante, sidekick and media booker, Hermann Kelly, who is also, as it happens, the mainstay of the Irexit movement. The best you can say of that is that it is an idea whose time has not yet come.You feel that he’s going to miss all this, is Nigel. There was a poignant moment on Wednesday, when he arrived at the summit venue only to be refused access by security, due to a mix-up, wilful or otherwise. Security is ever-present at the summit, with the 4,000-5,000 attendees – staff, diplomats, journalists, officials, hangers-on, Nigel, Hermann, all the greats – subjected to security vetting, airport scanners and long stares from gentlemen with earpieces and short haircuts. They gave Nigel an especially long stare and told him his papers were not in order.“Fifteen years I’ve been coming and it’s never happened before,” an outraged Nigel told reporters. “I’m hardly a security risk.” You’d have to have a heart of stone not to laugh.But there’s another chap in Brussels who loves summits as much as Nigel. Far away from the being hounded in the Dáil by Micheál Martin, or pestered by Shane Ross in the Cabinet room, Leo Varadkar exudes a glow of industry and satisfaction at these meetings of European leaders.This wasn’t just one summit, Varadkar explained at his press conference on Thursday. There were actually several inidual summits: the article 50 summit, the regular meeting of the European Council, the Euro area summit and the Asia-Europe summit. Actually, he left out the tripartite social summit (which preceded everything on Wednesday), and then there’s the Korea-Europe summit.No wonder Varadkar, in his best blue shirt and green tie (green for Ireland, blue for the blueshirts) looked so happy.After the summit dinner, the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emmanuel Macron, along with the leaders of Belgium and Luxembourg, slipped out for a few beers. (Not the only ones with this idea, it is true.)Asked by a passing drinker how Brexit was going, Merkel replied: “Please, it’s a wonderful evening – let’s not spoil it with that!” They should have invited Nigel. He’d have livened things up.Assuming he could get past the bouncers, that is."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3669041.1539953127!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey considers withdrawing from %C3%A1ras race after traveller ","story":"Presidential candidate Peter Casey has said he is considering withdrawing from the Áras race in light of the continuing controversy over his comments about Travellers.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The Presidential candidate Peter Casey has said he is considering withdrawing from the Presidential race in light of the continuing controversy over his comments about Travellers.In a statement issued on Friday morning, Mr Casey said he is taking the weekend off to reflect on his remaining in the race. In a radio interview later he said he would announce his decision by Monday.The development was unexpected but comes after the Donegal-based businessman has spent several days defending comments he made denying Traveller ethnicity, and claiming that the community does not play its full part in society.In the statement Mr Casey said he did not want his campaign to be dominated by one issue. Even if Mr Casey withdraws from the race, his name will still appear on the ballot paper, a spokesman from the Department of Housing and Local Government confirmed. Under Section 30 of the President Act 1993, no candidate’s name can be withdrawn after nominations have been confirmed by the returning officer. The would have happened on September 26th, the closing day for nominations to be accepted.The row has dominated the Presidential campaign since he made the comments on Tuesday. However, Mr Casey himself refused to withdraw the comments, nor did he move to draw a line under the controversy.He reiterated his stance by scheduling a visit to a new housing estate in Co Tipperary on Thursday. Local travellers refused to move into the estate of six houses because of a row over grazing land for their horses. Mr Casey said that their refusal was “selfish” and “nonsense” given there was a homeless crisis in Dublin.On his visit to the site on Thursday, the former Dragon’s Den panellist declined to meet with the local family, the McCarthys, who were due to move into the estate. He said he did not want to intrude on their privacy. He rejected the charge that his comments were racist, saying: “There is not a racist bone in my body.”He argued his point was he did not accept Travellers were a separate ethnic group. Local Traveller families and their representatives held a protest immediately after his departure and accused him of “racism”.As the row continued to escalate on Thursday night, Mr Casey issued a statement on Friday morning. It read: “In light of the events of the past few days, I am taking the weekend off from the campaign to think carefully about whether to continue in the race.“I do not want the people of Ireland to elect me as President of Ireland just based on one statement I made.“I want to be of service, and make a real difference. I have the expertise and ability to be an influencer. I want to connect people, at home and abroad. I know that my world experience and global views will make me a uniquely suitable candidate for President of Ireland - with drive, ability and energy.”He told RTÉ’s News at One that that he did not know that the ethnic status of Travellers is protected legally.“I did not know about the ethnic status. There are so many things going on. It’s only in the last year that I have been back in Ireland full time.He denied that he was racist or that his comments had been racist. “I thought we were way beyond this. Ireland is now a melting pot of people from all over the world. The proclamation says ‘cherish all the people of the nation’.”Mr Casey said he had not been pitting the Travelling Community against the homeless. He was amazed that houses in Tipperary were empty because of a dispute about land for horses.The candidate said he will take the weekend to discuss his decision with his wife, family and advisers. The last 48 hours had been strange, he admitted.“I was accused of being racist. That is absolutely not what my campaign is about. I promised my mother that I would stand for President, but she wouldn’t want me to get elected on this platform.”Mr Casey repeated numerous times that he was not racist and hadn’t a “racist bone” in his body. “I grew up in Derry at a time when you couldn’t get a job if you were Catholic,” he added.Reacting to the news, President Michael D Higgins said he thought it was a good idea for Mr Casey to take the weekend to reflect on his campaign.“Reflection is good, I wish him well,” he told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Mr Higgins said that Mr Casey knew of his reaction to the controversial comments on the Travelling community. “They were appalling comments.”He added that he likes to think that Mr Casey’s comments were an aberration and not a cynical attempt to use one of the most vulnerable communities for political advantage.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3668460.1539895179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey denies mixing up michael d higgins and ff mayor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidate Peter Casey visits Cabra Bridge in Co Tipperary on Thursday. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Presidential candidate Peter Casey has denied he made a mistake when he accused President Michael D Higgins of having objected to a Traveller halting site in Galway in 1968.Galway City Council has been unable to shed light on the claim, made during the Virgin Media One presidential debate hosted by Pat Kenny on Wednesday night, despite Mr Casey claiming that the objection was “on the public record”.Mr Ó hUiginn noted that Mr Higgins was not on the council at the time, and he has no recollection of him being involved in what transpired at Rahoon. Both men were at university together, and both served terms as mayor of Galway.Mr Ó hUiginn said the 1968 case was the one and only time he had objected to a halting site, and he had done so as there were concerns about its location next to a cemetery and in what was then a rural area on the outskirts of the city.Mr Higgins was not living in the area at the time, having settled originally on the east side of the city before moving to Circular Road near Rahoon.Galway Corporation’s plans in 1968 for a serviced halting site near Rahoon cemetery resulted in large protests, some of them violent. An  editorial at the time condemned discrimination against Travellers and coined the word “Rahoonery”.A Galway City Council spokesman said that Mr Casey’s reference this week was “too vague”, and also pointed out that Mr Higgins was not an elected member of the local authority at the time.The Galway Traveller Movement has said that Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina have been long-time supporters of Traveller issues, and challenged Mr Casey to provide evidence for his claim.A spokeswoman for Mr Casey said the candidate stood by his claim, insisting that he had not confused names, and that it was “on the public record for journalists to check”.Mr Casey would reveal more details on the day after the presidential election, or if Mr Higgins disclosed full details of his expenses, the spokeswoman said.During Wednesday night’s debate, Mr Kenny had asked candidates if they would like members of the Travelling community to live next door to them.Mr Higgins replied: “Yes, I have a halting site a couple of hundred yards from my house and they are wonderful people.”Mr Casey suggested that Mr Higgins objected to a halting site near his home in 1968. Mr Higgins said that was inaccurate.“I have never objected to a halting site,” Mr Higgins said. “I was an elected representative on Galway city and county council and I often took a stand, unpopularly, on the rights of Travelling people to be offered housing.”In a separate development, the Galway City Community Network and Galway City Partnership have jointly condemned comments made by Independent city councillor Noel Larkin on radio on Thursday morning, in which he defended Mr Casey’s remarks this week on the Travelling community.Galway City Partnership chief executive officer Declan Brassil said the incident was “particularly ironic and disappointing” given that Mr Larkin had signed a statement on human rights and equality which was endorsed by Labour Mayor of Galway Niall McNelis on Wednesday.Mr Casey had claimed Travellers should not be recognised as an ethnic minority because they are “basically people camping in someone else’s land”.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3669069.1539944421!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar says transition extension is not alternative to border backstop","story":"Speaking on the third day of EU summit meetings in Brussels, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a longer Brexit transition is not an alternative to a Border backstop, Video: EU Council\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar addresses media in Brussels on Friday. Photograph:  Ben Stansall AFPGettyTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that a possible extension of Britain’s post-Brexit transition period would not diminish Ireland’s need for a “backstop” to avoid a hard Border.He also told reporters on the third day of EU summit meetings in Brussels that it would be up to British Prime Minister Theresa May to decide whether she had to defy opposition from the Democratic Unionist Party and agree to the EU’s proposed backstop, which would potentially create trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. He said it was a “judgment call” Mrs May would have to make but said that without an Irish backstop, any withdrawal treaty might not be ratified by the European Parliament. European Union leaders have told Mrs May they are willing to extend Britain’s post-Brexit transition if it would help to resolve the impasse over Northern Ireland. Under pressure from within her own party at Westminster, Mrs May played down the proposal to extend the transition period, which is due to end in December 2020. However, she said she was committed to working with the EU to quickly resolve the backstop issue, which was blocking progress towards a Brexit deal. Mr Varadkar spoke to reporters about the issue in Brussels on Friday. Asked of a possible return to violence in Northern Ireland in the event of no-deal and with the imposition of a hard Border, Mr Varadkar said: “It’s not something that is going to be centre stage in the negotiations because the negotiations are very much about a solution and we’ve got to the point where they become very technical. “But certainly it’s something that’s in the back of my mind as a potential consequence if we get this wrong.”He said he was open to the idea of an extension of a transition period during which the UK operates within EU trade rules but added: “That’s not an alternative to a legally binding Irish backstop so it’s certainly not an alternative, it’s just something that might be part of the mix”. He said the internal politics of the United Kingdom were “very difficult”“But this isn’t just a case of getting a deal that Westminster can accept - it also has to be accepted by the European Parliament as well. And the European Parliament has been very strong in supporting Ireland and our need to have a backstop to avoid a hard Border”. Mr Varadkar is holding a series of bilateral meetings in Brussels today and has has already met the prime minster of Norway Erna Solberg and the deputy prime minister of Malaysia Ms Wan Azizah, while he spoke to Russian prime minister Dimitri Medvedev at dinner on Thursday.

Public accusations are very dangerous. If the legal situation ever changes, then I’d change my mind. But for now I don’t agree with the public lynching that he’s been receiving, and if Woody Allen called me to work with him again I’d be there tomorrow morning.“He’s a genius.” Bardem was speaking at the Lumiere Film Festival in France. He spoke fondly of filming Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which co-starred Penelope Cruz, now his wife.A scene from the set of Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which co-starred Scarlett Johansson Allen’s daughter, Dylan Farrow, wrote an open letter in 2014 renewing her claims that he sexually abused her when she was a child in 1992.“What’s your favourite Woody Allen movie?” she asked. “Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me.”Allen was investigated at the time but was not charged, and he continues to deny the allegations.Farrow’s story is backed by her mother, Mia Farrow, and her brother, Dylan. But another sibling, Moses, has claimed the allegations are fabricated.A number of actors have expressed their regrets over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Rebecca Hall and Colin Firth, prompted by Dylan Farrow giving a television interview in January.As recently as December, Kate Winslet was full of praise for Allen, saying: “I think on some level Woody is a woman. He understands the female characters he creates exceptionally well.”A few weeks later, she expressed her “bitter regrets” over “poor decisions to work with iniduals with whom I wish I had not”. She has also worked with Roman Polanski.Scotland Yard accused of ignoring complaints made against drug dealer which allegedly battered father to death on his doorstep13 million people in Britain have seen their local bank branch close down in past 10 years, ONS figures showBrexit latest: Michel Barnier says Brexit vote was driven by nostalgia - live news updates Donald Trump under fire for praising assault on  journalistTrend for balloon glasses is ruining the taste of your drinks, experts sayUS midterms: How do they work and what do they mean for the future of US politics?

GB\u0027s World Class Bartender Of The Year, Daniel Warren, told The :  Gin globes or balloon glasses are an important part of gin drinking history, originating in Spain and dating back to the 1700’s. Serving a gin and tonic in this type of glass helps to serve the drink chilled and maximise the aroma of the gin.“However, the current problem with these glasses is when the drink is made with cheap ice that melts quickly, it waters down both the drink and the flavour of the gin, working against what the glass was made to do!”Despite this, sales of the popular goblets show no sign of slowing down, and department stores have enjoyed a boom in sales.“This growing popularity can be attributed to the boom in gin sales as well as restaurants and bars continuing to get creative with gin, serving innovative and delicious cocktails for people to enjoy whilst dining out.  It hasn\u0027t taken long for our customers recreating some of these drinks when entertaining at home.The glasses are also used at some of London’s leading gin establishments, including the London Gin Club in Soho, and the Ginstitute in Notting Hill.The Fever Tree artisan tonic company also uses balloon glasses at all the gin events it hosts across the country.Scotland Yard accused of ignoring complaints made against drug dealer which allegedly battered father to death on his doorstep13 million people in Britain have seen their local bank branch close down in past 10 years, ONS figures showBrexit latest: Michel Barnier says Brexit vote was driven by nostalgia - live news updates Javier Bardem condemns \u0026#39public lynching\u0026#39 of Woody AllenDonald Trump under fire for praising assault on  journalistUS midterms: How do they work and what do they mean for the future of US politics?

The audible vehicle alert system (AVAS) was designed to warn visually impaired pedestrians when an electric vehicle is approaching, as the cars are almost silent when operating at lower speeds.

The Xr has an LCD screen rather than the richer OLED found on the Xs, and features only one camera on the back instead of two.The Xr starts at $749 in the US, or roughly in the same in pounds and euros.

If you’re not sure, then you probably\u0026nbsparen’tClick to followThe Independent(Royle) Family values: It does feel that there is a thing we can call northernness, which might comprise warmth, and friendliness, and humour and grit, but which is much more than the sum of those cliched parts, and much harder to properly defineThe north is a mercurial territory, and northernness itself a will-o’-the-wispish thing that’s hard to pin down.We know where the north (of England) ends – that’s Hadrian’s Wall, of course well, give or take. But arguments as to where it begins rage quietly in the background all the time. Anywhere upwards of the Watford Gap, goes the hoary old joke, if you’re from London.Research last year conducted by Liverpool University suggested that the north now begins somewhere in Leicestershire, having moved south slightly from Derbyshire. To a northerner from Lancashire or Yorkshire, both those places seem to be more the Midlands… but aren’t Midlanders really just northerners anyway?The north-south ide in schools is real – and it’s more complex thanWe in the north wear northernness like a badge of pride. In 2005, The Wedding Present released a single called\u0026nbsp“I’m From Further North Than You”. The band is from Leeds, which is squarely in the north. Yet it’s considerably further south than Carlisle, the most northerly city in England.It would take you the best part of three hours to drive from Carlisle to Sheffield. Sheffield is indisputably in the north, yet skirts those Peak District lands, the Nottinghams and Chesterfields which form the gateway to the Midlands.iStock)Last summer, website The Tab drew up a map showing the north-south ide according to the number of shops of baked goods purveyor Greggs in any particular area, and according to this metric, Sheffield was put in the south.Ridiculous, of course, as anyone who watched the opening episode of\u0026nbspDoctor Who earlier this month will know. The new – and first female – Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker, who hails from Huddersfield. The entire episode was set in Sheffield, and was as northern as you like – too northern, according to some commentators on Twitter. And heaven knows what the large contingent of American Whovians made of such joyous sight gags as a drunk throwing the salad out of his kebab at a menacing alien.If the boundaries are blurred, then northernness as a concept is perhaps even harder to pin down… at least from the outside. If you’re northern, you know it. If you’re not sure, then you probably aren’t.I have lived in the north all my life, first in Lancashire (and the bits re-designated Greater Manchester after local government reform in 1974), and then in Yorkshire. There is a rumour that northerners are warm and friendly, and we are. Or some of us, at least. We’re not exactly all dancing around like Munchkins there is still a fairly large contingent of people who will rip you off or rough you up or be generally as horrid as criminals are in London.But, by and large, the general populace does have what feels like a greater empathy for others than we, as northerners, often see on our sojourns down south. Up here in the north we genuinely smile at strangers on the street often even talk to them. I remember one of my first trips to the capital, to see Wigan play in the Rugby League Challenge Cup final at Wembley. A contingent of Wiganers were standing in Euston station, asking passersby how best to get to Wembley. They were roundly ignored, much to their puzzlement. A little while later I saw a different group handing out song sheets to stony-faced passengers on the Tube, offering to teach them some Wigan chants.We have space to breathe, in the north. The air’s a lot clearer than it used to be, thanks to various environmental acts and, oh, the fact that most of the heavy industry the country used to rely on us for has long since been closed down. We can get a decent-sized place to live. One of a northerner’s favourite TV shows is the famed comedy programme Location, Location, Location, which features Londoners with more money than sense cooing over properties the size of our toilets (which are all indoors these days, by\u0026nbspthe way) and which cost four or five times more than our actual houses.I am being facetious, of course. But it does feel that there is a thing we can call northernness, which might comprise warmth, and friendliness, and humour and grit, but which is much more than the sum of those cliched parts, and much harder to properly define.Oli Bentley is the creative director of a design studio based in Leeds, called Split. He has taken it upon himself to gather, like wool, various notions of northernness from writers and creatives for a project that was initially part of Leeds’ bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2023.A bid which, of course, was thoroughly torpedoed by Brexit, and the news earlier this year that British cities will not be welcome to apply for the accolade after we leave the EU next year.Undaunted, those driving the Leeds bid decided to build on the legacy of the hard work carried out in the city by holding a year-long celebration of culture in 2023. One of the first projects out of the trap is the book Bentley has curated, called These Northern Types.Bentley is entrenched in the north. He studied design at Cumbria Institute of the Arts, up there in Carlisle, and while studying at Leeds College of Music after that he set up his Split business from his bedsit. So what is northernness?“Northernness is a myth,” asserts Bentley. “As a designer, I spend much of my time working with identities – specifically, visual identities for companies, institutions, iniduals, bands and arts organisations: brands. I think it is this daily involvement with the perceptions of identities that made me fascinated by this multifaceted, community-owned, slippery thing we call ‘northern identity’. That, and the realisation that, as a lifelong proud northerner, I was beginning to feel unsure about what that actually meant.”So Bentley went on a journey to rediscover, or perhaps discover for the first time, what northernness really is, if it actually exists, and he went to writers and artists and musicians for their take on it.That great northern actor\u0026nbspWarren Clarke\u0026nbsponce played the role of a corrupt copper in Red Riding, the TV adaptation of writer David Peace’s The Red Riding Quartet. The books are an astonishing slice of Yorkshire noir, interconnected narratives which weave in and out of the Yorkshire Ripper murders and the subsequent hunt for their perpetrator, Peter Sutcliffe.Clarke played chief superintendent Bill Molloy, a gruff, no-nonsense copper who you wouldn’t exactly say exuded warmth and friendliness, but instead another aspect of northernness: determination, and the recognition that London is a long way away. Presiding over a group of colleagues in a clandestine meeting, Molloy proposes a toast: “To the north, where we do what we want.”Molloy and his compatriots meant it for nefarious purposes, but it’s a mantra that endures for less sinister reasons. Here in the north we can’t rely on anyone else when we do, they rip the rug from under us. We commit with all our hearts and souls and lives to digging coal or tempering steel, and then someone in London closes the pits and the foundries and there’s nothing else for us to do. It is an irony that the north voted, on the whole, for Brexit a lot of European money was pumped, over the years, into communities ravaged by the death of industrialisation. But the majority Leave vote was born from that suspicion of outside forces exerting too much influence on a region that has been bitten and burned many times.The Capital of Culture being torpedoed and rising as a legacy project is an example of that determination, as is Bentley’s curating of the book These Northern Types. It is, as you’d expect from someone who trained in design, an artefact as much as a text it comprises 17 inidually-bound books, collected together, and created by some of the most interesting thinkers in the north today.In his introduction to the book, Bentley writes: “The focus of this project is, at times, less about location, and more about class – an issue that touches nearly every chapter. Or they are about what it is to be ‘other’ to ‘the position of civility... always taken by the seat of power’.“About living in the other half of the country from the centres of power, finance, media, intellectualism and culture – a situation shared not only with communities from Wales to Dorset to Scotland, but with communities all over the globe.”These Northern Types offers a taste of the north that is unparalleled since someone in Wigan decided to put a meat and potato pie between a barm cake. It is beautiful to look at yet uncompromising and direct. In the essay “Does It Still Matter Where We Come From?”, Dr Katy Wright addresses whether there is, in fact, any need to align yourself to northernness or anything else.She writes: “For many – though by no means all – northernness has involved a sense of marginalisation, abandonment and peripherality, which has often been accompanied by experiences of misrecognition, and stereotypes projected from outside. These have involved portraying northerners as, variously, uneducated, opinionated, mean with money, unsophisticated or conservative. Struggling northern towns and cities like Hull, Scunthorpe, Barnsley and Morecambe provide the punchlines to unfunny jokes about ‘crap towns’ and shitholes.”It is, after all, grim up north. At first it was grim because of the industry that roosted here like dark ravens, the sooty chimneys of Dickens’ Coketown (a thinly disguised Preston), the blackened faces of the miners, the clang-and-heat of the Hephaestan steel forges, the hypnotic rattle of the cotton looms. And then it was grim because the industry was torn down. Grim because of the grit and we have grit because of the grimness.Boff Whalley was the guitarist in agit-popsters Chumbawamba now he is a playwright and the founder of the Commoners Choir. His piece is about northern grit, and how the elements haven’t just formed our dramatic landscape, but do the same to us.“So much of northern culture – historical, social and political – has sprung from our weather,” he writes. “The Smiths were The Smiths and not the Beach Boys because they were born into a land of dripping raincoats and stone doorways that you huddle into. Ted Hughes thrived on the bleak grey swirl of Yorkshire uplands. Our favourite fiction, from the Brontes to Alan Sillitoe to Ken Loach, is peppered with the drama of rain. Many of Turner’s paintings are suffused with storms, mists and fogs (he climbed the hill above what’s now my home town at the foot of the Yorkshire Dales to make endless studies for his great painterly skies) English films – from Billy Elliot to The Full Monty – are drenched in the melancholy of rain. And what comes of all this dour, dull weather? Resilience. Resolve. Gritting your teeth. Grit.”Grim… grit… here’s another one for you. Graft. That means hard work. It’s also the name of the typeface Oli Bentley put together for the book and for anyone else who wants to use it. A typeface for the north. Bentley himself questioned the point of the exercise, other than being a nice little artistic project. Then he had another idea: “Let’s use the typeface to work with local community groups across the north. We bring the letters, they bring the words. Then we put these words up in the places they’re from. This led to the idea of printing giant outdoor posters – the sort you can easily and cheaply flypost. To work with local writers to amplify voices – not just listen, but help them be heard.”Because being heard is something the north struggles with. When we complain that we’re being left behind, we get thrown bones such as the Northern Powerhouse project, an admittedly ambitious plan to boost the economy of the north, put into place by the Conservative-Liberal coalition, much lauded and trumpeted, and then quietly… well, if not abandoned, then at least put on the shelf with the other exciting new initiatives that were going to transform the north, until such time as anyone south of wherever the north’s border is these days cares enough to put money into it. And meanwhile transport – one of the major tenets of the Northern Powerhouse – continues to struggle, with train services especially a bone of particular contention. They don’t call Northern Rail “Northern Fail” for nothing these days.Boff Whalley mentioned The Smiths and, indeed, music is part of the fabric of the north. Benjamin Myers is an author who this year won the Walter Scott Prize for his novel The Gallows Pole. It brought him £25,000, but his win was largely ignored by the London-centric publishing press. For the book, Myers writes about music, as well, and in doing so explodes a myth about living in the north that is prevalent. His piece is a paean to watching bands, and then forming one, a familiar rite of passage: “You gig round the north, the four of you, with your bad hair and bumfluff ’taches. You play es and established venues you play political benefits and school halls and nightclubs and student unions.Emmerdale\u0026nbsprolling hills, you know (Getty)“Being in a band forces you to be an adult at 15 as you deal with clueless promoters and jealous death metal bands, American rock stars and patronising regional DJs. You ward off stage-invading Nazi skinheads and cynical producers. You duck flying bottles and you get thrown out of your own shows for being underage.“You come from that part of the north that rarely gets written about – neither the gritty towns and cities of economic decline nor the dales and vales and uplands, but somewhere in between: the lower-middle-class suburbs. Here is a seemingly endless maze of culs-de-sac and alleyways, tarmac and green spaces, where aspiration exists, and creative seeds are sown, yet which broader culture barely seems to acknowledge, as if the north is either terraced houses or Dales farmlands, Corrie or Emmerdale. It’s not that black and white though most live in a grey-area Britain.”Are we seeing the resurgence of Nazism? This graphic novel thinks soSpoiler alert: Have fractured viewing habits ruined the suspense?Dacre Stoker on resurrecting his great-grand-uncle’s vampireThrough the works in These Northern Types, only a fraction of which are referenced here, several things seem to emerge. There is something called northernness, but it’s difficult to pin down. We’re just like everybody else, but completely different. We don’t even know where the north begins, nor can we agree on what it really means to be northern.It’s almost as if the ideas of northernness are laid down by other people, and none of them are what we really feel. But we can’t voice how we truly are inside, because to examine it too closely would make it seem less distinct, less real.The north is a place made up of iniduals, bound by an ethereal quality that is at once a myth and, conversely, as real as grit and graft. Northernness is perhaps something everyone here has, and is, but in subtly and uniquely different ways. The north makes us, and northernness is what we make it. So raise your glasses please, to the north: where we do – and can be – what we want.‘These Northern Types’ is out now, priced £32, from splitNorth of EnglandCapital of CultureShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It might, for instance, contain water ice, hidden in shadows on its otherwise blazing hot surface, scientists speculate – a discovery that could help shed light on the possibility of alien life in our own solar system.It will also look to explain why the planet has such as huge iron core at its centre, and unlock the history of the vast\u0026nbspvolcanic vents that shook its surface for billions of years.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sun\u0027s powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of 60 kilometres (37 miles) per second.The European Space Agency\u0027s Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO), which will survey the planet\u0027s surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiter\u0027s 11 instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (Mixs) was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxa\u0027s Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) will study the planet\u0027s internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than 350C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled heat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: UK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColombo and the incredibly sophisticated set of scientific instruments on board.The international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the new space age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasa\u0027s Mariner 10 flew past the planet three times in 1974-75 and the American space agency\u0027s Messenger probe orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, taking photos of the surface.Dr Jerry Bolter, project manager at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said: The scientists describe Messenger as the hors d\u0027oeuvre and Bepi asThe spacecraft was named after the late Guiseppe Bepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the 1974 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury.Paolo Ferri, head of missions at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, said: Mercury is a planet of extremes, and getting there requires some equally extreme techniques, navigation solutions and operations expertise.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Parliament is going to insist on using its proper authority.”And Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, said: “Labour doesn’t accept that the choice facing parliament will be between whatever deal Theresa May cobbles together or no deal.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“That is not a meaningful vote and Ministers can’t be allowed to silence parliament. MPs must be given the opportunity to scrutinise, consider and, where appropriate, amend any resolution the government puts forward.”The controversy comes as hundreds of thousands of people prepare to march in central London this Saturday to demand a People’s Vote referendum.The Independent has been running its own Final Say campaign to demand the referendum, with more than 860,000 people having signed its petition so far.In April, asked whether the motion on the Brexit deal “would be amendable”, Mr Baker replied: “I believe the position is that parliament can always seek to amend motions.”And he suggested MPs would be able to impose a referendum, or seek to change the nature of the deal, which might send the prime minister back to the negotiating table.EU leaders decide to shelve plans for Brexit summit in November May rejected EU offer to break Brexit deadlock because of costFrench government warns on visas after no-deal BrexitNHS cannot be \u0027confident\u0027 about medicine supplies after no deal Brexit\u0026nbsp“Clearly, the range of amendments that is possible is within the bounds of the imagination of all members of parliament,” Mr Baker told the committee.But, in his letter, Mr Raab “Once the deal is presented to parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision, and one which is clear to the British public.”A six-page memorandum suggested amendments would only be accepted if the main motion passed first. If the motion fell, the amendments might only be considered “points of view”.The letter also warned: “Amendments – even those which may not intend to affect approval – may actually result in the government being unable to ratify the withdrawal agreement.“It is important, however, to recognise the need ultimately for the House to consider the question that is in reality before the UK – whether or not to accept the deal that the government has negotiated with the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But she cannot let it distract her from securing a deal on BrexitClick to followIndy PoliticsThe row over universal credit could not have come at a worse time for\u0026nbspTheresa May. With most of Whitehall’s resources and almost all of Downing Street’s political capital focused on Brexit, No 10 is now also having to stave off growing backbench unrest about the government’s flagship welfare policy.The introduction of the new system has been dogged by delays and warnings about the impact on struggling families. Ministers have already made a series of changes and no one doubts that more will be needed. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the government “will make sure we get this benefit right”. People may ask why, six years after the change was approved by parliament, it has not done so already.Tory backbenchers are increasingly concerned about the policy and the impact it will have on their constituents. This is not a minor reform – the switch to universal credit will affect eight million working-age people. MPs are already being bombarded with tales of people forced into debt, destitution and, according to one Labour MP, prostitution\u0026nbspas they are transferred to the new system.Labour fails to force government to release universal credit papersPolitically, too, the fiasco is damaging for the Conservatives. If the next election is not until 2022, it is issues of public services and welfare that could prove pivotal, especially universal credit, which directly affects more than one in eight voters. The public bought into the idea of belt-tightening when it was needed to reduce the deficit. With the economy growing and Ms May having heralded the end of austerity, that argument no longer holds.The tales of hardship that accompany every debate on universal credit will trouble Tories who fear once again being seen as the nasty party, and fuel perceptions that Conservative modernisers worked so hard to dispel.The disastrous implementation of the policy also spectacularly undermines what will inevitably be one of the Tories’ main electoral arguments: that they are the party of competence and efficient management. The problem is not the concept of universal credit, which has cross-party support, but the implementation of it.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May leaves after a news conference at the European Union leaders summit in BrusselsPolice officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

Field, who has represented Birkenhead from almost 40 years, revealed in a letter to party chief whip Nick Brown that he could no longer serve the party as the leadership was overseeing the erosion of our core valuesThe policy was seized on by George Osborne at a time when he was looking for a vehicle for swingeing welfare cuts to help reduce the\u0026nbspdeficit. The result is a policy pushed through on the cheap, without the proper funding and thought needed to adequately implement such a drastic change to the welfare system. Philip Hammond is likely to use this month’s Budget to plough further money into the policy, but it is unlikely to be enough to solve its\u0026nbspmultiple problems.The frustration for Ms May is that the fiasco causing her such a headache is not of her own making. Universal credit was introduced long before she became prime minister. It is hard to believe that, if she could, Ms May would not quietly scrap it and be done. But that would be a huge admission of failure on the part of her government and a major victory for Labour. \u0026nbspUniversal credit is the greatest blunder by a British government yetInstead we can expect further delays as ministers scramble to amend the flawed policy while also staving off the prospect of a parliamentary defeat. With Tory backbenchers warning that almost 30 of them are prepared to vote against the government on the issue, any significant votes on universal credit\u0026nbspare likely to be pushed back until next summer at the earliest. No 10 cannot afford to let this domestic debacle distract from the task of securing a Brexit deal that can command parliament’s support.The government has managed to unite Jeremy Corbyn and Jacob Rees-Mogg, Gordon Brown and John Major, in calling for the full roll-out to be halted.Mr Major this week compared the row to the poll tax crisis that helped bring down Margaret Thatcher. If he is referring to a government ploughing ahead with a deeply unpopular policy that can only cause it further trouble, the comparison is, for Ms May, worryingly close to the mark.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It would also make David Friedman, the US ambassador to\u0026nbspIsrael, who is hated by Palestinians over his support for Israeli\u0026nbspsettlements in the West Bank, the main interlocutor with the Palestinian leadership.Israel’s plan to demolish West Bank village ‘could be war crime’It follows a series of decisions by President Donald Trump that the Palestinians say proves the Americans have sided with Israel and are no longer objective mediators.Mr Pompeo defended the change, saying that it would be more “efficient”.“This decision is driven by our global efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. It does not signal a change of US policy,” he said.He added the United States “continues to take no position” on how any peace deal between the Israelis\u0026nbspand Palestinians would take shape.This decision has nothing to do with peace. It complicates peace and makes it impossible\u0026nbspIn Israel, the move was celebrated.Michael Oren, deputy minister for diplomacy and a former Israeli ambassador to the US, said it was “great day for Israel, Jerusalem and the US”.“Closing the US consulate in Jerusalem and transferring its responsibilities to the embassy ends the last vestige of American support for the city’s ision. Israel is deeply grateful.” he wrote on Twitter.Australia could move Israel embassy to Jerusalem from Tel AvivWomen fined by Israel over cancelled Lorde gig raise money for GazaUS student held in Israel for a week because she ‘backed boycott’Israel are no mugs, McLeish tells angry Scotland fansIsrael reduces Palestinians’ permitted fishing zone by a thirdMerkel will cancel Israel visit if village demolished: Army RadioBut it sparked fury among the Palestinian leadership that dismissed the decision as part of a plan to “reward” Israel.Saeb Erekat, Palestinian’s chief negotiator said “It\u0026nbsphas a lot to do with pleasing an ideological US team that is willing to disband the foundations of American foreign policy, and of the international system, in order to reward Israeli\u0026nbspviolations and crimes.”“The Trump administration is part of the problem, not part of the solution,” he added.Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said it was a “very bad decision” that violated past agreements and continued Mr Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.“Now, he is cutting the last connection he is said to have with the Palestinian people. He is practically saying Jerusalem is for Israel. This decision has nothing to do with peace.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

They got neither.Both couples claimed other commitments but, given that they all took centre stage at Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and the Beckhams also made the cut for William and Kate’s big day, perhaps they felt this wasn’t A-list enough Instead, we had to make do with, among others, models Naomi Campbell, Cara ­Delevingne and Kate Moss, X Factor judges Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, and actresses Demi Moore and Liv Tyler.Some of whom uploaded gushing videos from the event and Instagram photos of their outfits with hashtag plugs for ­ious clothing brands.At a “royal” wedding  The notoriously traditional Queen Mother must be turning in her grave.There will be the modernisers within the palace walls who regard this as “progress” for a monarchy that, as they see it, must appeal to a younger generationit is to survive.But to my mind, it’s the complete opposite.The pomp, ceremony, tradition, duty and, most importantly, ­mystique of the royals is what sustains them.This wedding — between a “Princess” who performs no royal duties and her Jack of tequila trade — has shone a ­spotlight on the blindingly obvious threat that, once the dutul Queen and Prince Philip are no longer with us, the ­“modern” monarchy will continue to make ever decreasing circles until the taxpayer finally decides, “Hang on — they’re just like us” and the game will be up.With this #royalwedding where even the bride’s mother, left, Instagrammed a designer plug “for my amazing dress” that threat has just come one step closer.RITA ORA is promoting her new album Phoenix. “It’s my first global release of an album.I’m really excited to express my music to the world,” she says.But why the seemingly ­regular need to, er, express her breasts at the same time After all, Ed Sheeran has never posed in just his kecks and he’s sold  squillion records.ANGRY passengers on a flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul intervened to stop Home Office officials from deporting Somalian Yaqub Ahmed.“I know he’s scared,” protested one, before leading a chant of: “Take him off the plane, take him off the plane.”Though probably not as scared as the -year-old girl who was gang-raped in London by Ahmed and two of his equally unsavoury friends – the crime for which he was being deported before these witless do-gooders stepped in.Pitully, the officials capitulated and Ahmed is still in this country awaiting our next move.Meanwhile, as some of the passengers virtue-signalled their liberal credentials by posting footage of the showdown, perhaps they could now be identied and charged with obstructing the course of justice Or, at the very least, be asked to welcome the delightful Mr Ahmed into their own homes until such time as his removal can be rearranged Let’s seetheir liberalism extends to putting their own teenage daughters at risk.PIZZAS and pies must shrink to tackle obesity, claim new official guidelines from Public Health England.Sigh.

But the Bible saysI be a fool, I be a fool for Christ,” Chris said.Weve had people healed just in the past few months, even a little baby of about nine months old, who had a fever and couldnt stop vomiting.Ive been healed twice. When I broke my ribs in a car wreck, I remember walking into church in so much pain and I could hardly breathe and somebody put their hands on my ribs and I walked out a dferent person.“When I was on drugs I wasnt even living. All that dope, all that alcohol, all those parties and things that I would go and think ‘boy Im having fun.“It wasnt even until God come into my le that I actually knew what it was like to live.“Out of all the dope Ive ever done I tell people theres no greater feeling than the power of God moving, on you and through you.“When God moves on you to take up those serpents, words can’t describe that feeling. It aint me. Its the power of God.”Services at the House of the Lord Jesus are similar to those practiced by other Pentecostal faiths - except that followers here use snakes, fire and poison in their worship.They are held every Sunday and can last between  minutes to four hours long depending on how many people feel “overcome with the spirit”, want to testy about their experiences or be healed.The snakes are always brought to the service in their wooden boxes but arent always brought out.Chris had explained earlier how he wouldn’t take out the snakes unless he felt the “holy spirit was with him” a sensation he says “is better felt than described”.Throughout it all, the snake never bites anyone around it or attempts to, and almost looks leless, until Chris puts it down on the pulpit and it coils into a ball.During the fascinating spectacle, the frenzied churchgoers clap, dance, scream and shout some even appear to speak in tongues.Afterwards Chris, who suffers from liver problems and is unable to work, is exhausted, sweating and breathless.He tells me afterwards he had to rush to the bathroom to vomit mid-service: “Sometimes the spirit comes on so strong it makes you sick,” he says.Three people come forward to be healed or to ask for prayers for loved ones. The congregations gathers around them and lay their hands on them.“Outside of believing in the five signs of the Gospel I dont think we’re much dferent from any other church.“When God moves in that way we participate in taking up the serpents and whatever  he may ask it to be, fire, poison, pray for the sick, speak in tongues, cast out devils.“We don’t worship the snake, we worship the Lord Jesus Christ, but in the Bible Luke tells us that he gives us power to tread on the scorpions and serpents and nothing shall hurt us by no means.James Bowman, , a mechanic from West Virginia, said he came to the church for the first time two months ago after seeing a video of a service online and believes “finding Jesus” has finally cured him from his lelong alcoholism.“It was the serpents that attracted me here,” he said.“I was a full blown alcoholic but as soon as I saw him lt those snakes that was it for me and I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol since and I don’t plan to. I’ve got my le back.”James now brings his we Crystal, , to the church - along with their three grandchildren, Elaila, , Justin, , and Aubrey, , who sit in the front row mesmerised and unafraid during the snake-handling service.Pastor Chris was just  years old when he saw his dad receive a fatal bite from a rattlesnake as he was preaching.Mack Ray Wolford died a slow and painful death as the snake’s poison coursed round his body stopping his blood from clotting, causing him to haemorrhage to death - taking his last breathe around nine hours later.Almost  years later, Chris watched as his beloved brother Mack “Randy” Wolford die in the same way – bitten by a deadly rattlesnake while he was preaching during an outdoor service.Chris tearfully recalls trying to give his brother - who he described as his “best friend” - CPR and how blood gushed out of his lungs with every compression.“I hated to lose my dad. I loved my dad. And I loved my brother more than anything. He was my pastor, my brother, my best friend. “I mean there wasnt a day that went by that I didnt call him or he didnt call me - we were very, very close. Not a day goes by I don’t think about him but he found something that was worth dying for, something that he loved more than he loved his self. “The day he got bit - and it was the same with my father - when we asked ‘do you want to go to the hospital ’ They could - we dont force nobody not to go. But they chose not to go. They were willing to give their lives for what they believe. “I tell people this,it aint worth dying for, it aint worth having and it aint worth believing in.“With my father and my brother, they kept the faith. They fought a good fight, they kept the faith, they finished the race, the course and theyre at peace or with the Lord now.“And I dont even thinkthey could come back, theyd want to come back. I believe that they’re just happy where they are.“The night he died - my brother - I remember sitting at his feet and I told him, I promised, that wed see each other again, that its not going to be the last time we saw each other and Im going to do my best to keep that promise. So one day we can meet on the other side.”And Chris, who has been bitten several times, the last time just two months ago, says that while he doesn’t want to die from a serpent bite, he would be willing to die for his beliefshe had to.“Its not for us to question why these things happen - it’s to believe,” he said.“I watched my father die that way, I watched my brother die that way and its a hard way to die, but I hopeits ever asked from me from the Lord, Im willing to do it.“I’d rather go that way than with a needle in my arm.” Chris’s we Judy comes in part-way through the service and stands at the back.She also lost a family member - her brother - who got bitten while serpent handling and she is terried of losing her husband the same way.“Of course every Sunday I worry it might be the last time I see him. I worry about him getting bit.“I’d rather he could worship God another way - without drinking that poison or holding those snakes. “But it’s his choice and there ain’t nothing I can do to change that.”Chris keeps around half a dozen fully grown snakes in the basement underneath his church - including venomous timber rattlesnakes and copperhead snakes.He also has around four babies after he was given a pregnant snake. Usually the snakes are caught from the surrounding countryside, and kept with heat lamps in glass cages and fed mice.A picture of Jesus watches over the snake den. Chris rejects any claims he mistreats the snakes - and has past inspections from local authorities.“We take good care of these snakes. Some of them I reared since they were babies.“If any of them refuse to eat we put them back out in the wild - some of them just won’t eat in captivity and we don’t want them to die so we turn them back out.”Bizarrely Chris seems terried of the snakes when he uses his snake hook to display them for the camera.The jittery snakes rattle and hiss at every opportunity - the very opposite of how the rattlesnake in the service limply allowed itself to be swing around. “You can see how scared I am of them when God is not with me,” he says.“But when the Spirit is with you all fear just goes.“Anything is possible with the Lord.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cox said he decided to park it up after its engine began to smoke, and denied intentionally torching it.On Wednesday, Cox told his trial he accidentally ran over victims Miss Poole and Miss Nicholls after becoming frightened by revellers threatening to batter him in his vehicle, which he claims he had driven near the crowd of people to break up the fight.But prosecutor James Wilson accused Cox of using his vehicle to deliberately run over a man who was trading blows with his friend, only to miss and repeatedly run over the two young women, aged in their early twenties, who were sitting on a kerb.Mr Wilson said: Today you say you wanted to try and break up the fight.But you know full well you werent breaking a fight up. You were using the car as a weapon.You know full well the reason you went for that man is because he was confronting a friend of yours.You deliberately drove that car at that man with intent to cause him very serious harm.And you are responsible for those girls injuries because of your anger and annoyance at that man who was confronting your friend.Cox denied trying to hit the man, who has not been identied, and also denied knowing he had run over Miss Poole and Miss Nicholls, despite driving over and reversing over their bodies twice and subsequently having his car attacked by witnesses.It comes after Benjamin Thomas and Callum Banton, both , were pleaded guilty to affray and were jailed.Cox previously told the court: It felt like I hit something and I went into the air and came down and I was stuck.It was like it was stuck on top of something and I couldnt move forward.I werent paying attention properly. I wasnt thinking. I thought I hit a bin or a bollard.I only realised Id hit someone when I was arrested.He said he had been scared by people threatening him through his side window and had tried to flee by driving around the crowd of people and mounting the pavement.But Mr Wilson pointed out the pavement had been occupied by several pedestrians at the time, including victims Miss Poole and Miss Nicholls.Newport Crown Court had previously heard the university friends suffered really serious injuries after being repeatedly run over, with Miss Poole needing specialist skin grafts and Miss Nicholls suffering a lacerated spleen.Cox, from Newport, was remanded in custody and sentencing was adjourned until Friday morning.After the verdict, Kelly Huggins of the CPS, said: McCauley Cox used his vehicle as a weapon and caused an incident which left his victims with serious injuries.The CPS showed in court that his actions in driving his car into the crowd and reversing over those injured on two occasions amounted to this serious offence."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wdwdwd.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"factory northfleet kent covered melted metal burns","story":"The victim, aged in his s, suffered multiple deep burns to his head, neck, chest, abdomen and legs in the incident at a metal refining company in Kent.Emergency services raced to the factory which melts down metal in a high-temperature furnace.He was rushed to hospital with le-threatening injuries after the melted metal poured down upon him from above and doused his body.The liquid was believed to have inflicted severe burns which melted the skin on his head, neck, back, legs and abdomen in the horric accident at .am.Colleagues at the Britannia Refined Metals site in Northfleet, Kent, immediately rushed the young man into a shower to try to cool him down and paramedics were said to have spent almost two hours treating him and rushing him to hospital by land ambulance.Do you know who the man is  Email us at tips@the-sun or call   .

If extending transition is an option they want to look at, we must go along with that. For us to say at this point that we’re not listening would not have been very sensible.”Business bosses backed a longer transitionit meant getting a deal.CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn said: “Business’ patience was already threadbare and is nearing an end. The need for compromise on both sides to agree the Withdrawal Agreement and secure the transition period is long overdue.FILM legend Sir Michael Caine yesterday predicted furious business chiefs would force the EU to strike a Brexit deal.The multi-millionaire actor, , insisted he still believes in Brexit.He said it was better for the UK to be in charge of its own destiny than in hock to Eurocrats.In a BBC interview he said: “I’d rather be a poor master of my fate than having someone I don’t know making me rich by running it.”He suggested German car companies were the key to trade deals.The chief economist at Germany’s biggest bank has predicted the UK would thrive after Brexit.Deutsche Bank’s David Folkerts-Landau said yesterday Britain would do “just as well or better” after it leaves the EU.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

boxing","story":"It’s not the first time a Sun reporter has had to dodge a punch but this time it’s a heavyweight trying to land one, with his personal trainer egging him on.Luckily for me, this heavyweight is st Darren “Dibsy” McClintock, whose obesity battle hit the headlines after his trainer Mike Hind banned takeaways from serving him.And even luckier, we have both just endured a -minute bootcamp workout at Mike’s gym — and as Dibsy tips the scales at nearly four times my body weight, it means I’ve got a bit more energy left than he has, enough to dodge his last few lunges in the boxing ring.But, exhausted and covered in sweat, Dibsy still gets awarded the winner’s belt in a light-hearted ceremony.It’s another encouragement dreamed up by Mike to give Dibsy the belief that he can win his personal battle of the bulge.His story — including his admission of weighing st rather than the st widely reported last week — has brought the UK’s obesity crisis into sharp focus.We are the third fattest nation in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation, and the North East, where Dibsy lives, is one of the most obese regions in the country.He has struggled with his weight all his le, and the death of his father from cancer when Dibsy was  didn’t help his increasing reliance on comfort-eating.Numerous efforts over the years to lose weight failed and his huge bulk now has a devastating effect on his le — he is single, he can’t get a job, he has to order specially-made clothes and when he goes on holiday he has to book two plane seats.Dibsy, , finally decided to act earlier this year when a heart scare landed him in hospital for a week and a doctor delivered the stark message: “Diet or die.”Married dad-of-three Mike heard about Dibsy’s plight and offered to take him under his wing for a year.He now puts him through his paces twice a day at his Mas Body Gym, in their home town of Middlesbrough, and provides all his meals from his newly opened healthy eating diner.Dibsy was consuming an alarming , calories a day — an average man needs around , — but was burning hardly any because he was so inactive.He is now down to , a day after ditching takeaways, booze and unhealthy snacks and, thanks to his new exercise regime, is burning , a day.The results are remarkable.On day one he couldn’t walk more than a few yards without getting out of breath.I joined him for a workout on day ten as he proudly announced: “I’ve lost ½st already.”The first exercise — just a warm-up, said Mike — involved flipping a huge, kg lorry tyre.Despite his weight, Dibsy isn’t lacking in upper body strength and he made it look easy — which it isn’t.We then moved on to pushing a metal sledge theof the gym and dragging it back the other way, with Mike holding on to make it harder.Then it was on to the kg slam ball session — hurling a medicine ball into the ground with as much force as you can.Next came smashing a sledgehammer on to the lorry tyre as hard as possible, as Mike yelled at us to do it harder.The innovative bootcamp exercises are designed in part to replicate the physical exercise people might do in their daily jobs, and are perfect for Dibsy.Mike, , explained: “He is too big for conventional gym equipment, so we need to get him doing something dferent.“You work with what you’ve got and using this equipment we have devised a set of exercises that put him through it without creating too much strain on parts of his body that can’t handle it yet.“We also have a heart monitor on him all the time which gives a real-time readout of his heart rate and calorie burn rate.“The strain on his heart is something we need to keep an eye on, soit gets too much we ease off and let him rest.“We also need to make sure he doesn’t overheat, sohe is getting a bit hot we use a leaf blower to cool him down.”By then we were both shattered, but there was little time for rest as Mike moved us into the boxing ring.“Don’t hit him too hard, Dibsy,” instructed Mike. “Or not at all ”, I suggested.Thankfully, Dibsy was just about done in — the heart monitor revealed he had burnt , calories that session — and I could keep him at arm’s .Afterwards he told me how he had got so heavy.He said: “I have never been skinny but the weight started really going on in my early teens.“I have never been sporty andmy mates went to the park for a kickabout I’d just sit it out because you are embarrassedyou can’t run around with them.“My family say that my dad dying of cancer at , when I was , had a big effect, but I’m not so sure.I wouldn’t blame my weight on that, it’s down to me and no one  that I am this size.“I have been seeing doctors and dieticians for years and my weight would go up and down.I lost st at one stage but it went back on.“People do say things in the street or stare and kids call me ‘Fatty’.That obviously hurts, so I go home and comfort-eat to make me feel better, which puts more weight on, which attracts more comments. It’s a vicious cycle.“I have had girlfriends and long-term relationships and I wouldn’t say I have lost them because of the weight.“But I am single now and being this size does affect that side of your le.“I knew I had to do something after I had my recent scare. It started when I began getting out of breath.It got worse and I could hardly breathe. It was terrying and I was taken to hospital.They said my heartbeat was all over the place. Normally they said they would give me some drugs and shock my heart so the beat gets back to normal.“But they had no idea how much drugs to give me — they were scared I wouldn’t wake up.So instead they gave me beta blockers and blood thinners and basically hoped I didn’t have a heart attack.“I was in hospital for a week and a doctor came round and told me I couldn’t keep doing this.“He saidsomething didn’t change, I was heading for an early grave. To see the look on my mother’s face when he said that was heartbreaking.I have never had a doctor be so straight with me before and I decided that this time I had to do it for real.“I didn’t know Mike but I had heard of his new diner which serves healthy food so I went down with my mum and got chatting to the staff.“He got to hear about my plight and messaged me to say he could help. The next day I went to see him and he asked me about my le and what I hoped to achieve.“It was pretty emotional when we talked about what the doctor had said. My mum said she didn’t want to bury her child and we all ended up in tears.“Mike agreed to help, both with an exercise plan and a meal plan. It was intimidating going into the gym for the first time. I have been to gyms before but it has never worked for me.“But at Mike’s gym everyone is so encouraging and wants me to succeed. And the support Mike gives me away from the gym is incredible. He texts me about  times a day to check I am OK.“One evening, a couple of days into my new exercise regime, I was at home and I messaged him to say I was struggling. It was a night that I’d usually have a takeaway and I was missing it.“Without a moment’s hesitation he said, ‘I’ll see you at the gym in ten minutes’. I said, ‘But the gym is closed’. He replied, ‘I own the gym — see you there’.“We did a -minute workout and I got home exhausted and went to bed, really pleased with myself.“It’s support like that which is getting me through. I want to learn to drive and get back into work.I used to work in a chemical plant but got laid off.Since then it has been impossible to get another job because of my size.BREAKFAST: Two sausage sandwicheswith a pint of FantaMID-MORNING SNACK: Packet of crispsLUNCH: Chicken sandwich with full-fat mayonnaise, packet of crisps, a pasty and bottle of CokeDINNER: Huge plateful of chicken curry, rice, naan bread and spring rolls – plus a ham sandwich while that meal is cooking.

Saudi slammed shut Qatar’s only land border and barred state-owned Qatar Airways from its airspace.For a nation that imported much of its food and goods, it might have been calamitous. Yet little Qatar — it is smaller than Yorkshire and expecting to host .million football fans in  — has fought back.In the lunar-like landscape  miles north of capital Doha is a farming complex where black and white Holstein cows munch fodder in air-conditioned sheds. All , of them were brought in from Germany, Hungary and the US since the blockade began.It’s led to bosses at Baladna Farm being hailed as the milk sheikhs.Its marketing manager Mark Somogyi tells me: “Before the blockade at least  per cent of dairy products were from abroad. Today Qatar is practically self- sufficient in fresh milk, as little as three per cent is imported. Nobody foresaw the blockade but the country is coping very well.”So what of the vast World Cup building preparations under the blockade, which sees most goods now arriving at Hamad Port In an exclusive tour, Qatari organising committee officials were keen to show stadium preparations were on schedule.Seven futuristic arenas are rising out of the desert with one revamped, aircon blasted ground — the Khala International — already finished.For this is the World Cup where money is no object. For brimming with petro dollars, Qatar is the richest nation on Earth. At the Al Wakrah Stadium, nine miles from Doha, the seats are already going in.Modelled on traditional dhow fishing boats, the ,-capacity stadium may host games up to the quarter final stage. The pristine pitch is like a green oasis amid the construction dust where , migrant workers toil.Inside what will be a players’ dressing room, Mohammed Emaran, , is sealing plasterboard where Gareth Southgate could be giving his team-talk in four years.The labourer — who earns around £ a month for a six-day week with free lodging and food — says: “I’m happy with the work and send money home to my family in India.”Yet two migrant workers have perished during construction work at the £million arena.Anil Kumar Pasman, , from Nepal, died at Al Wakrah after being hit by a lorry in . And a -year Nepalese scaffolder fell to his death on August . He is believed to be the first reported fatality at a tournament venue since January , when British construction worker Zac Cox, , died helping refurbish the Khala International Stadium.Yet one union has claimed , people have been killed working on projects for the  tournament, a claim vehemently denied by Qatari officials. Qatar’s World Cup organising body, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, says the Nepali scaffolder’s death is still being investigated.Project manager Thani Khala Al-Zarraa, , says of the latest tragedy: “Half an hour after I heard the news I gathered , workers at the stadium. I told them, ‘You came here to support your family, so whatever health and safety instructions we tell you is for your own good, so that you go back to your families’.“But in construction you cannot eliminate all risk. Mistakes happen.”Qatar’s £billion spend on World Cup infrastructure has eased the financial pain of the blockade for many of the .million population.Doha is currently a vast building site as new tower blocks rise and a three-line metro system is constructed. More than  greenhouses have been built in the desert amid hopes to become self-sufficient in vegetable production by .Some England fans had planned to stay in Dubai and fly in and out for the games. But direct flights have been canned under the blockade.The Middle East’s first World Cup will also have a shortfall of hotel rooms. But there are “glamping” sites in the desert while cruise ships moored in the Gulf will also provide accommodation.Yesterday Qatar was sweltering in the muggy, low Cs. But during the tournament — from November  to December  — it should be a balmy  to C. Still, a thirst-quenching beer might be out of the question.It is unclear what the rules on alcohol sales will be in a Muslim land under Sharia Law, where drinking in public is banned. Five-star hotels serve alcohol, but £ for a bottle of beer is commonplace.Budweiser told The Sun it will be an official sponsor at the Qatar World Cup — but can’t yet confirm whether it will be allowed to sell its beer at stadiums and fan festivals.Travelling supporters could also take in a camel race at the Al Shahaniya race track an hour outside Doha.After Qatar banned child jockeys in , the camels have been ridden by robots in racing silks.Another unusual sight is the desert scrapyard at Al Wukair, where around , vehicles, including cars, boats, lorries, buses, bulldozers and cranes, languish in the dust. organising committee boss Hassan al Thawadi insists: “The blockade hasn’t hindered our preparations. We had to find alternative suppliers . . .  and since then projects are still on track.”In Qatar’s beating heart, Doha’s Souk Waq market, locals have turned beating the blockade into a matter of national pride.World Cup replica hawker Ahmed Khala, , sells at least one £ le-size replica copy of the gold Fa trophy a day alongside tea mugs fashioned in the shape of niqab-clad women.Ahmed says: “Why didn’t they do a blockade before Qatar won the right to stage the World Cup  They’re jealous Qatar has the tournament.”If the blockade is still in place come , Three Lions fans will at least be guaranteed a decent cuppa.All thanks to the milk sheikhs of Arabia.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In , British parliamentarians accepted pound, of benefits from the Saudi regime, according to the Mail. But this year the figure is already three times higher at pound, - and it’s only October. The trips, which usually include business class travel and swanky hotel stays are supposed to be ‘working visits’ which give MPs a ‘better understanding’ of Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the UK continues its multi-billion pound arms trade with the Kingdom. Since , the UK has licensed almost pound billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, as they’ve waged their controversial war against Yemen.  Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “It shouldnt take the disappearance of a journalist for the UK to reconsider its relationship with the Saudi regime. Under Parliamentary rules, MPs have to declare gts and trips on the register of members’ interests. Here are some of the MPs who have accepted hospitality from Saudi Arabia, and what they declared. Theres no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of any of the MPs, and all benefits were declared properly. Leo Docherty - Conservative  Tory MP Leo Docherty lavished praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman at Prime Minister’s Questions in March. But the Mirror revealed Mr Docherty had accepted pound, in paid for trips and flights from Saudi Arabia, visiting the Kingdom twice in six months. His first visit in September, just three months after he was elected, saw him meet with King Salman Abdulaziz bin Saud as well as senior government officials, “in order to support and understand the British-Saudi relationship.” And in January this year, he visited the Saudi-Yemen border region to “see impact of ballistic missile strikes in the Saudi Yemen border region and gain a deeper understanding of the strategic importance of the Coalition operations in Yemen.” He described Crown Prince Salman, who was visiting London at the time, “a force for tremendous stability in a very turbulent region.” Mr Docherty told the Mail: “It’s important to note that these visits are not “treats” or “donations” but working visits that take time and effort to a serious purpose – i.e. better understanding a key ally for our country.” Phillip Hammond - Conservative  A Watch worth pound,, from one of Saudi’s richest men. He declared it a private gt, given to him as an MP, rather than as Chancellor. Ministers are banned from accepting gts worth more than pound. His spokesman said civil servants had advised him the gt was not related to him being a minister. Stephen Metcalfe and Mark Garnier - Conservatives pound, for ‘flights, transport, food and accommodation’ for a visit to Saudi Arabia.

The APLE Collective – Addressing Poverty through Lived Experience – is not a think tank. It’s made up of real poverty experts – Universal Credit claimants from places like Stockton-on-Tees and Salford. People who want to know why, in five years since the controversial benefit was first rolled out, no one has bothered listening to them. “The Government needs to start listening to people actually on Universal Credit,” Diane Pottage, , of Stockton, one of the letter authors told me. “We keep hearing it’s working. Well, I’m sorry, it isn’t. Butyou listen to us, we can tell you how to fix it.” Tory Brexiteers blast Theresa Mays plot to keep Britain tied to the EU for longer than plannedHer solutions are: “Stop the rollout to any more places, and take time to listen to the people who are on it. Go back to fortnightly payments. Stop the five-week wait for help.” This week – after two ex-Prime Ministers attacked the benefit, and Esther McVey finally admitted “some people will be worse off” – leaked documents suggested the Government is desperately seeking solutions to stop UC becoming the new Poll Tax. Yet, the voices of claimants are still being routinely ignored. Meanwhile, the Government fought Labour tooth and nail in Parliament this week to avoid releasing its own impact assessments of how people have been affected. Ministers tampered around the edges – delaying the rollout of UC for those on existing benefits. But, of course, people in low-paid work are always becoming ‘new claimants’ as one precarious job ends and they need help while they find another one. Meanwhile, at least , people with existing claims will still be ‘migrated’ to UC during . That may seem a small numberyou don’t have children to feed. “My social safety net is gone because of Universal Credit,” another of the letter’s authors, Letitia Rose,  from West Yorkshire, said. “It’s not just the way the benefit works, it’s all the pathetic administrative errors.” The next day the Government admitted wrongly underpaying , disabled people to the tune of poundbn. Patricia, , told me she was actually working at the Jobcentre when the new benefit came in – before needing to claim UC herself when the contract ended. “It’s not better for people, it makes things worse,” she says. “I don’t think politicians would survive a week on Universal Credit, let alone a full year.” Campaigners have been inspired by events in Scotland, where claimants are being brought into the design of benefits. In April, the Scottish Social Security bill enshrined in law ideas that “social security is a human right” and that “respect for the dignity of iniduals” must be at the heart of Scottish social security. Most workers earn less than they did seven years ago when Tories came into power“This is not just about people saying how bad things are – it’s recognising they have the expertise needed to address poverty,” says Ruth Patrick, a lecturer in social policy and social work at the University of York, who works with benefit claimant group Dole Animators. People with experience of poverty are not just case studies to be wheeled out. They should have a seat at the policy-making table.” This week, the poverty experts held a string of events nationwide to mark the International Day for the Eradication of World Poverty. Diane helped run a stall at Stockton Market, urging people to share their experiences. Letitia was involved with similar events in Salford. Patricia spoke movingly at the House of Lords. And UC claimants took over @wiganpier, our Wigan Pier Project twitter account. Five years after UC started, Diane’s own story is bitterly familiar – a six-week wait for help, then a wrong payment. “I’ve been to a food bank twice before and I’m not very far from needing one again,” she says. “The system is broken. My mum and dad were both working class but they weren’t going to a food bank.” The APLE Collective has yet to hear back from McVey, but the DWP say it has received the APLE Collective’s letter and will respond “in due course”. It says that with Universal Credit people are getting into work faster and staying in work longer. A spokeswoman added that “through our ‘test and learn’ approach we continue to listen to feedback from stakeholders and claimants and make improvements to the system”. Yesterday, I dug out the DWP’s press release from the first rollout in April . “Universal Credit is nothing less than the start of a fundamental cultural sht of the welfare system,” it proclaimed. “This will revolutionise the way people experience the welfare state.” A revolution that has cost hopes, dreams, potential, and even lives.

And the Mirror research shows the squeeze is only worsening. “Some workers who most deserve a rise have suffered some of the biggest cuts. Your investigation exposes the emptiness of Theresa May’s conference claim that austerity has ended. “The next Labour Government will end the Tories’ disastrous austerity and give workers a decent pay increase with a pound-an-hour real living wage.” At the party conference earlier this month, Mrs May admitted the after-effects of the crash were still being felt and that too many people haven’t had a decent rise. But she promised: “Because you made sacrices, better days are ahead.”  However, Stephen Clarke, of independant think tank the Resolution Foundation, told the Mirror the pay outlook is weak and that benefit cuts have only just begun to take effect. Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: “The figures graphically demonstrate that people have been working harder and getting poorer thanks to the Tories. “We are suffering from the most severe wage squeeze since the Napoleonic war.

The result is heartbreaking footage showing tearful Bruce and his partner delivering Ruby which will screen on TV tonight. Bruce told the Mirror: It was a Monday morning and we went in for scan but the midwe couldnt find the heartbeat. She called in a colleague for a second opinion but I could tell by her face it wasnt good. In  seconds my le changed forever. Tonight Channel  viewers will see Bruce after seeing his we go through  hours of labour unable to bring himself to cut the umbilical cord - which had planned to do had she lived. He said: It was a blur. We went home and then realised we had to call people and in may ways thats the hardest point. You hear a voice and dont know what to say, I just said shes gone, Rubys gone. It was massive shock.  When it came to cut the cord, I couldnt do it, I wanted to run out of the room. I just broke down, Vicki was so strong. However he did hold his baby adding: For  seconds I held her and it felt like she was really there. Following the birth Bruce struggled to be around his partner. He said: I couldnt face it. Her boobs were hurting because her body was producing milk but there was no baby to drink it. Her arms were aching because her body was telling her to hold her child. People forget a womans body has spent nine months preparing for birth, it doesnt just stop. After the birth it wasnt long before the grief became impossible for Bruce to bear, he explained: I thought I was a strong man and could deal with but I couldnt I wanted to get back to normal as soon as I could and couldnt be around Vicki who was grieving more openly.  After ten days we started to go our separate ways and then I went to see a counsellor which I am so glad I did. Bruce said: I went to see my brother in Spain and was just walking down the street when the anxiety hit me and I thought I was having a heart attack. It was the grief. I was so naive.

The case of so-called Mad Cow Disease , known in full as Bovine Spongorm Encephalopathy, was identied at the unnamed farm as part of the routine testing of all fallen stock over four years of age. A movement ban has been put in place at the farm as investigators try to establish the source of the fatal disease. Chief vet Sheila Voas said up to four other cows on the farm will be slaughtered and tested for the disease. Speaking on BBC Scotlands Good Morning Scotland radio programme, she said: The animal itself is dead, she died before she was tested, and there are three other animals, or possibly four, that will need to be slaughtered purely from a precautionary basis.  She said brain stem samples would be taken from these animals and tested for BSE. She believes the disease was not transmitted and occurred spontaneously in the affected animal, but she warned it could be several months before investigators could say for certain. All the information we have is this is under control, theres no reason for people to panic, she added. Its not the start of an outbreak, its a single isolated case that wont affect the food chain.  Officials have stressed the case poses no risk to human health and its discovery proves the surveillance system in place is working effectively. However, any farmer with concerns is advised to seek immediate veterinary advice. Scottish Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing has activated a Government response plan to protect the farming industry. He said: While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the diseases origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working.  Millions of cattle were culled in the UK in the s during a BSE epidemic. It can be passed on to humans in the food chain, causing a fatal condition called iant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Strict controls were introduced to protect consumers after the link was established in . The disease has been reduced to a handful of cases each year in the UK, with the last recorded case in Wales in . Prior to the discovery of the latest case, Scotland had been BSE free since . Food Standards Scotland said strict controls remain in place to protect consumers from BSE risk.

But a store manager made his day on October  by stepping in to lend a hand. Tesco is Jays favourite shop and he is always excited to visit.  Dave, a firefighter, was having trouble coaxing his son away from behind the closed cash register because he had decided he wanted to work for the store that day. Noticing his struggles, manager James came over and opened the lane so that Jay could have a go on the till - leaving his dad warm-hearted. Delighted to see his son so focused and engaged, David has praised the stores staff for their patience and empathy in helping him turn a challenging moment into a wonderful memory. David said: I was trying to get him out from behind the till, but Jay decided he wanted to work at Tesco that day.  I was having real dficulty but amazingly the manager, James, came over and opened the till for him. He felt like a worker and it just warmed my heart to see how focused her was and how much he was enjoying himself. It was amazing to see [the staff] take the time and patience to do this for Jay. We call him the ultimate icebreaker because he will talk to anyone, so the staff know him quite well - but we had never met James before.

The detached home was built in  and very little inside has changed since, even most of the furniture are original pieces from the era.The keys to this distinct home in Cross Hands near Llanelli , called Heol Bryngwili, was handed to the first owners in the autumn of .And its remained in the same family until now. The current owners are reluctantly passing the keys on as they need to downsize, reports Wales Online. Even just walking up to the property you get a sense of the unique and historic home that awaits you. The classic art deco features are obvious the led crittall windows and symmetrical feel to the design, yet broken up by a curved wall and window and the inclusion of a first floor balcony. Once the outside is painted white, the home will look more Miami Beach than Cross Hands... Originally the house may have had a flat roof in the art deco style, but the pitched roof is definitely a bonus, avoiding any possible flat roof problems in the future. In through the glass led front door and the hall still has all the original woodwork, including a brilliant built-in telephone seating and storage area.The stair rail, wood block flooring and door pelmet all promote the classic dark wood interior design look of the era. Deep coving and skirting boards, and solid wood led interior doors throughout the home add to the s visual display. Into the front reception room and one of the stand-out features are the two crittall windows. Multi-led and including a leaded classic arrow design in one , these windows are an absolute must-have in an authentic art deco home. Over the windows are decorative window pelmets incorporating the classic stepped art deco design. This attention to detail illustrates how important the design of the home was to the builder and the family who then owned it. The feature tiled fireplace with accent black horizontal tiling is straight out of a s design book and has surely been the main gathering point for the family and visitors through the decades. The arched alcove above the fireplace again shows that art deco design was, and still is, an important aspect of this home.  As was common decades ago, this front room would have probably been considered as the parlour, the posh room reserved for visitors and important family gatherings. The most used room by all family members would most likely have been the rear sitting room. In this family room the atmosphere is more relaxed. The room still has the crittall windows, pelmets and decorative coving but the fireplace is arguably less flamboyant than the front room and the built-in cupboards suggest a multi-ing family room with the need for storage and bookshelves. This warm and cosy room still emanates the atmosphere of yesteryear and the le of a busy family using the space. Decades ago this room would have been the heart-of-the-home, not the kitchen diner as it is today.Updated during the s the kitchen in this house is small by todays standards. Although perfectly usable, there is scope for a new owner to create a spacious kitchen diner at the rear of the property by getting the sledgehammer out.There are a number of small rooms behind the kitchen that could be incorporated into the space and luckily few art deco features remain here to destroy. Theres a boiler room, side entrance hallway and pantry that could all become part of a modern kitchen diner. Hopefully the new owner will chose the kitchen design carefully to complement and pay homage to the art deco calibre of the home, rather than overwhelming it with contemporary design. Upstairs there are three good sized bedrooms, with the master at the front of the house having direct access on to the curved balcony.  But the star of the show on the first floor is undoubtedly the bathroom. The original green tiling including horizontal dark accent tiles is a s site to behold. It is rare to find a bathroom with tiling untouched by time. The bath may have been replaced at some point, its likely the original was a roll-top bath, but many other features remain. The arched canopy over the bath is a delight, as is the window pelmet, ceiling coving and s style basin and taps. The toilet is in a separate room next to the main bathroom, resulting in the main room feeling spacious. Outside there is a rear garden which could be considered large for a suburban property, plus a lawned area at the side. There is a garage and workshop at the back of the land. This frozen in time property has always been owned by the same family and ideally the vendors are looking for a buyer that will love the original art deco features and s style as much as they have. Theres even the possibility of some of the original furniture being included in the sale by negotiation. This truly unique property offers a new owner a choice to preserve all the originality that makes it a one-off home of distinction. It remains to be seen how much of it is loved and restored and what ends up in a skip outside. The house is on the market for pound, with estate agent Clee Tompkinson Francis Carmarthen branch.

Back in February, the housing company announced Mr Fairburns bonus would be cut to poundmillion following a public outcry after it was announced he would receive a poundm payout. Persimmon came under pressure from both politicians and investors after their uncapped bonus scheme was announced. The outrage came after it emerged the companys profits and share price had been built on the sale of controversial leasehold contracts and the taxpayer-backed Help To Buy scheme.  When the bonus was announced in , it was thought to be the biggest ever awarded at a listed company, and one shareholder called it grossly excessive. There is now renewed public backlash over the enormous sum following his cringe-worthy interview on BBC. During the interview, Mr Fairburn was asked by reporter Spencer Stokeshe had any regrets about the furore surrounding his bonus  He visibly squired as he stubbed over his words before his PR interjected saying: Its time to go.

The reporter then asked: So you dont want to discuss that today  Are there any lessons weve learned from that  It was the biggest bonus in the country.The housing boss then dropped his head before walking off screen. He then said: I think its really unfortunate actually that youve done that. The clip quickly went viral with people taking to social media to comment on the enormous sum.  One woman named Sarah wrote on Twitter: Grossly excessive seems like an understatement. A man named Dave agreed saying: How can anyone be paid a bonus of pound million pounds  What about the workers!

A spokesman for Independent Network, a membership of trusted local window  door installers powered by VEKA, said: “From wonderingwe’ve left a window open to questioningthe lights are still on, there are many niggling questions we ask ourselves each day. “And once you have that thought, evenyou are certain you did it, it can be hard to forget about it completely until you can go and check. “For some, it gets so bad, they have to drive back home to make sure their door is locked or the window is closed so they can concentrate on the rest of their day. “But many of these little niggles could cause troublewe did in fact forget to do them, so it’s easy to see why they can play on your mind and lead to a worrying day. “Leaving your door or window open could leave your home at risk, especially when you are at work all day.” The study found ‘did I lock the front door’ is the most common question Brits ask themselves followed by ‘have I got my phone’ and ‘do I have my keys’.  Worrying about what to have for dinner and whether you’ve got everything you need is also at the forefront of the nation’s minds along with concerns that a window has been left open at home. ‘Did I turn off the light’, ‘have I locked the car’ and even ‘did I leave the front door open’ also appear in the list. Four in  have been so worried they have left something open or unlocked, or turned on, they have called a friend or neighbour to pop back home and double check. And almost one in four have left a spare key with someone so they can get in to their home to make sure things are shut and turned off when they are too far away to check themselves. A third have even left work in the middle of the day, or used their lunch break to go back home to put their mind at rest. Are these niggling doubts our subconscious trying to tell us something   One respondent even went back home to check they had turned the hob off to find a fire engine outside and a house full of smoke confirming that they had left it on. A quarter of those polled, via OnePoll, have ed home from work to find they have left a window open while almost one in five have gone back to their car only to find they had left it unlocked. More than one in twenty have also opened their front door to find the iron or their hair straighteners still switched on. But while most niggling worries have usually proved to be unfounded,  per cent are glad to have gone back to check their home. Four in  even went as far as to say they would feel anxious all daythey weren’t able to go back and check something while another  per cent would feel on edge. A spokesman for Independent Network, added: “As a company we are very tuned into how homeowners live their home lives and how busy they are, but even we were surprised by some of the results! It just goes to show that we are all under the same pressures and juggling a million things each day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what meghan harry gifts theyre","story":"NewsWhat Meghan and Harry do with all the gts theyre given on royal tour - and its sad news for some peopleThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have received many presents from the public in AustraliaShareCommentsByNicola OakleyHead of Audience:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghan-gets-first-baby-gt-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have accepted many lovely gts from the Australian public over the first four days of their royal tour .And theyre likely to receive many more as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. On Friday in Sydney, Meghan looked shocked when she was handed a bunch of carrots before excitedly telling Harry: Weve got veggies! The carrots were later pictured on the floor with other gts given to the Duke and Duchess. But what exactly happens next  Are they allowed to keep the gts and do they use them  Although each gt-giver would love to think Harry and Meghan will cherish their present forever, they cant possibly use them all. So heres what happens next...  Any present handed to Harry and Meghan while they are shaking hands at public engagements is classed as an official gt. Every single gt handed to any royal on an official engagement is recorded on a form.According to the royal family website, these gts do not become the private property of Meghan and Harry - or any member of royalty who receives them. The Duke and Duchess presents fall into the official category as they are given by iniduals not personally known to the Member of The Royal Family during walkabouts.If perishable gts with a value of less than pound - like the carrots Meghan was handed on Friday in Australia - are not to be personally used by the royalMeghan isnt going to put them into a stew then they may be given to charities or third parties to avoid waste.Third parties include the royals staff, so Meghan could technically pass those carrots on to her royal aides.  Perishable gts with a value over pound which wont be used by the royal recipient should pass to charity. Non-perishable official gts, when not used by the recipient or passed to charity, are stored - and once its in storage, things get a little bit more complicated... These stored gts are reviewed annually by a  of experts from the Royal Household and Royal Collection, who consider each gt in terms of its national, historical, aesthetic or financial value. Then they decide what happens to each gt, which can be:Kept in storage Incorporated into the Royal CollectionLoaned to a reputable and appropriate organisation Donated to a registered charity Destroyedit is not to be retained, loaned or donated to charityGts falling into the first two categories are supposed to be retained for five years. Iniduals and organisations meeting the royal family on official engagements are discouraged from offering extravagant gts. It is not known what the couple will do with all the teddies and baby gts they are being given. They might choose to keep some of them, but as there are so many its likely theyll decide to give some to an appropriate charity so others can benefit from the generosity of their Australian fans.

Police found the bodies of her parents, James and Denise, at the family home in Barron, Wisconsin on Monday and Jayme has not been seen since. Authorities now say Jayme was inside the home when her parents were killed, according to evidence at the scene and a cryptic  call. In the call, a disturbance can be heard in the background, according to US news reports. The girl, who was immediately ruled out as a suspect and runaway, was missing by the time officers arrived just four minutes after the call was made.  Barron County Sherf Chris Fitzgerald said on Wednesday Jayme was in the familys home when her parents, James and Denise, were killed based on evidence from both the scene and from the  call. Fitzgerald told CNN the phone the  was made from had been recovered and they had since determined who it belonged to. However, he would not identy the owner of the phone. There was no one speaking to the dispatcher on the phone but some kind of disturbance could be heard.  Autopsies confirmed that Jaymes parents had been fatally shot but no gun was found at the scene. Relatives of the family said the front door of the home was shot in. Meanwhile, the FBI has since joined the investigation as authorities urged the public to keep phoning in tips about Jaymes whereabouts. are the experts in breaking down  tapes, looking at our phones, and taking care of all evidence in that manner, Fitzgerald said. The sherf has so far declined to elaborate as to why investigators believe Jayme is not a runaway, saying that disclosing more information would compromise their investigation. Fitzgerald said: Im telling you, Jayme is missing and endangered.  He said that even though theyve received more than  tips, none have been of a credible sighting. He implored the public to share any suspicions, including any behavioral changes in people they know, no matter how small. He said: We want to bring Jayme home and put that smile back in her familys hands. Is it a random attack or a targeted attack  I dont know that answer. Thats why those leads are so important.

Enter Melania Edwards.Melania is a HSBC exec, who works as part of the companys Global Venture Capital Coverage Group, and spends her time flitting between two Northern Calornia offices.She recently shared a a day in her le with Business Insider, and its honestly just a little bit bonkers.The business woman claims she gets up at .am every day and kicks things off with a spot of meditation focusing on deep breathing and determining her priorities for the day.An hour later, at .am she catches up with friends and family members across the globe via Facetime.At am she has breakfast, which consists of a bowl of fresh fruit or a bottle of green juice. She then heads out to a court near her home for a game of tennis before work, but by .am shes out of her tennis gear and on her way to the office, walking all the way there of course.She says she reaches her destination by about am. Her day is then full of meetings with venture-capital firms, technology companies, and new startups, at least it is until around noon when she breaks for lunch.  And its not the brief, half an hour lunch break us Brits are used to grabbing as and when. Oh, no. Melania takes plenty of time out to refuel. She grabs a salad from a nearby farmers market at the Ferry building before sitting by the bay and watching the water. Its  minutes later when she eventually gets back to it, but instead of heading back to the San Fransisco office, she hops on a train to Palo Alto. And while shes commuting she listens to a podcast and checks her email. Before she gets to her second destination of the day, she makes time to nip to Starbucks and grab a steaming cup of English breakfast tea.English breakfast tea is my favourite, as I am British,” she admits. I will have one coffee in the morning and English breakfast tea for the rest of the day.When shes not working, in her free time, Melania is busy getting a certicate in innovation and entrepreneurship from Stanford university.Andthat werent enough, she also works with an organisation in Papua New Guinea to promote women’s economic empowerment in the country because she likes to give back.  But it doesnt end there. At .pm she does some yoga, before cooking dinner from scratch with her boyfriend and taking a relaxing evening stroll around their neighbourhood.People on Twitter had a lot of questions about Melania and the article.One user branded the whole thing ridiculous.  They wrote: This portrayal is ridiculous on multiple levels. And also no one can afford lunch daily at the Ferry Building. Another commented: OK, my current theory about the Business Insider story is that either the author or an editor personally knows and LOATHES Melania Edwards, told her they were doing a profile, and carefully formulated this cannot-tell--satire article to ruin her le. A third said: Something seems fishy here... Others were convinced Melania doesnt really exist.

Elina Childs took full advantage of the first day of cannabis legalisation, selling munchies as people were stood in a queue outside a shop. The savvy nine-year-old, from Edmonton, sold all  boxes in less than  minutes, earning for the youth organisation. She and her father Seann had filled a wagon with sandwich biscuits and mint thins to satisfy the cannabis users eventual cravings.  They were surprised how quickly they were snapped up outside Nova Cannabis. Elina and her dad went down to the shop after school, and they walked up and down the queue selling the biscuits for a box. Elina said the whole experience was fun, while her dad revealed he borrowed the idea from Boy Scouts who sold biscuits to cannabis smokers when the drug was legalised in Calornia, US. Seann told CTV News: “We were going to sell them in the neighbourhood and it’s always been a little slow. Elina was actually bit by a dog once.  “She did a fantastic job and was very polite and everyone was very polite with her. He said the experience helped to teach his daughter about legalisation. In a separate interview, he told the Canadian Press: “People thought it was awesome. There were people telling her she was doing a great thing, that it was very innovative. There were cars stopping on the street to buy cookies from her. It was really something . I’d never seen anything quite like that.” He added: We like to have frank discussions with her, so she understands what it is and take away that mystery behind it. Just to show her people of all ages and all walks of le are doing this and its legal in Canada now, just demysty it for her so its not a big deal for her.  Elina has cystic fibrosis and the Brownies programme has helped to keep her active, Seann said. He told CTV that smoking is normally harmful to her, but this was “the one day she could benefit from smoking. Afterwards, Elinas strategy was praised by a local Girl Guides official. On Wednesday, Canada became the first major industrialised country to legalise recreational cannabis, and the second nation in the world after Uruguay. The rules allow adults to buy cannabis products from licensed producers and retailers, and possess up to  gramsof dried cannabis in public.

But so far in Australia, Harry,  and Meghan, , have broken this rule several times. The most interesting time was in Melbourne, when the Duke of Sussex approached a -year-old woman in the crowd at the Royal Botanic Gardens.India Brown was holding a sign which proclaimed: Been here since am, loved you since I was eight.

Taylor and Kern Lehman,  and , believe the similarities are drawn because she looks like the actress, they have age-gap relationships and that they are a striking couple. The pair from Phoenix, Arizona, USA, started flirting at a bar five years ago but never expected their rebound fling to turn into marriage. After discovering a shared love for music, travelling and having fun partying, the pair quickly moved in together and now have been married for over a year. Taylor met her other half through best friend Amanda, , who is the daughter of Kern - and despite having rocky patches, the three now get along again.  The couple who have been mistaken for father and daughter once, now also have the support of their families despite initial concern and shock. Taylor said: When we first met, I worked with Kerns daughter, she was my best friend and he was married at the time. I was also in a relationship. At first I thought he was very handsome. I have always been attracted to older guys. He thought I was cute, and we started flirting at the bar.  Amanda and I had been friends for a year before I got with her dad, so I did have a lot of guilt and felt bad at first. But over time I have gotten over that. She knows I will always be there for her in her le and problems. Kern is very handsome, and I adore how he carries himself, hes so educated, smart and successful. Our similarities between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas , I think are more apt for me than him. They have a similar age gap to us. She is brunette and he has silver hair, like us, but Kern is way better looking than Michael Douglas. People have told us we look like them while vacationing and that we are a very striking couple.  Weve only had one experience of people confusing our relationship, it was when we closed on our Calornia home, the notary said, Your daughter can fill this out or sign here We started laughing and Kern told her, shes my we and the notary felt stupid. At the beginning my parents were kind of concerned, my mom was upset that this was my friends dad, but they know Ive always dated older men. But time heals everything though and my mom, dad and step mom have visited us and are all fine with it.  For Taylor it took a while to get used to the stares of strangers most age gap couples are met with. But over time she adapted and now doesnt care what others think. Taylor said: When we first got together I was very insecure, I felt everyone was staring or questioning us, but that was only because it was new. People stare at us, but I think its because when we are both dressed up we are a good-looking couple. Taylor admits that she was surprised they got engaged and then tied the knot last year, in an intimate -person ceremony in Cancun, Mexico. She said: We found out we had a lot in common, but I dont think either of us expected we would get married. We thought it would be a rebound thing for us both. But, we hit it off, we like the same music and are both old souls. I fell in love with him for his personality, it made him so attractive to me. He is fun, outgoing, we both like to party, and he was charming. I appreciate his age, wisdom and also, the security we have as a couple.  Instead of considering children in their future, Taylor says the loved-up duo are happy with their the freedom their lestyle allows them from partying to date nights and exploring the world. She added: Why would I want to change at that part of his le, honestly I love my le, we enjoy the freedom of traveling and having fun together. Every year we spend a week in Mexico, its fun but its a party. We have a lot of alcohol and fun. I am very domesticated too. Love being home, cooking and house work. We both take pride in our home and hosting. With an age gap of -years between them, the couple have had to speak about the possibility that Kern could pass away before her and lay out future plans.  Taylor said: We met with a trust and will attorney, its something not a lot of mid-s women have to deal with and its pretty hard. But who knows what will happen. Tomorrow is never promised. I could go first tomorrow by a freak accident or anything. Feeling content with the lives ahead of them, the pair are due to celebrate their second wedding anniversary in May. Kern, a retiree, said: Taylor has a great sense of humour, is vivacious and an old soul. She also has a huge heart and is fiercely loyal. Also she is my best friend and is very easy to talk to about anything.  I didnt really have any reservations, and whether Amanda realizes it or not she was largely responsible for our meeting. Neither Taylor or I really expected it to develop into what it did at the time. When it did, my attitude was that Ive done a lot for my children, but choosing my mate is not within their purview. Kern advises others in age gap relationships to ignore people who look down or judge their love. He said: If it makes you happy and you click, its nobodys business but yours andpeople want to be judgmental the hell with them. Leave them in their glass house.

Particularly right now, he’ll be working to get them and get Dundee out of this hole they’re in and, as time passes, he’ll worry about how it looks.”Soutar points outDundee drew up a profile of the man they needed, McIntyre would be one of those who came closest to ticking all the necessary boxes.“Jim’s now an experienced manager with knowledge of the Premiership and he’s been successful. I know he got the sack at another of my old clubs, Ross County, last year, but it was a harsh decision.“I’ve a lot of time for Roy McGregorand he’s a man who hasn’t made many mistakes up there.“Getting rid of Jim and Billy Dodds was one and I think when he looks back on that he’d probably agree.“As for Jim himself, he is a proud man who will work very hard to put things right a Dundee.“What happened at County will have hurt him and he’ll be determined to prove he still has a lot to offer – I think he has.“In the past he’s got the best out of players and while he’s inheriting a few good ones at Dens, I think it’s fair to say there are a few others who’ve under-achieved.”Soutar’s also convinced Dundee are getting a man whose stock in Scottish football remains high, and rightly so.“While he’s been out of the game he’s been linked with a few clubs andsome of them chose to go another way, I know he knocked back a few offers because they weren’t right for him.“He’s wanted to get back in at a club where he feels he can achieve something in the top ision and Dundee fans can be happy he thinks we fit that bill.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/Lee-Wilkie-column.jpg ","title":"lee wilkie called out dundees board hours before neil mccann was sacked","story":"In words that now appear almost prophetic, in his column on Monday the Tele’s Lee Wilkie sent a clear message to Dundee that trying to force an experienced new assistant on manager Neil McCann would end badly.Within hours of that appearing, the manager had been sacked after the club admitted attempts to “support” him had not come to fruition. vw, px\"  Now Wilkie has praised McCann for supporting existing No  Graham Gartland by effectively falling on his own sword along with him.While accepting after a dreadful start to the season the pair can have few complaints over their sacking, the former Dark Blue has praised McCann for his bravery.Wilkie said: “If Dundee were wanting Neil to get rid of Graham Gartland and bring in someone  to their liking, he has done the right thing and I do admire him for that.“Ultimately, results are the responsibility of the manager and no one  and it would not have been right for Gartland to carry the can – evenhe’d kept his job with another coach coming in, it would have undermined his position.“It means they’ve both gone and I’m sure Neil realised that would be the casehe took the stance he seems to have – so it took guts.“And I am sorry to see him go because he’s a person I like and I also liked the way he wanted his team to play football.“In the end, though, it’s a results business and he knows that as well as anyone. As much as I would defend his view on the way the game should be played, I can’t defend his results and I can see why Dundee felt they had to move to make a change.“They probably could have gone about it better because, as I said yesterday, when you try to bring in someone and the manager isn’t up for it, it won’t work.“It’s happened at other clubs from time to time and the end result is usually that the manager goes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"paul mcmullan looking to put fizz in dundee uniteds league form","story":"When it’s put to him ‘seeing it was Irn-Bru Cup weekend so no-one should be surprised he turned in a Man-of-the-Match performance at Partick Thistle’, Paul McMullan manages a wry smile.Particularly under previous boss Csaba Laszlo, it was often only in that competition – the least important to Dundee United – the attacker got the chance to show what he could do over the whole  minutes.And while, more often than not, he responded by being the best player on the park, it became increasingly obvious it was not going to provide a route back to a regular starting slot in the all-important Championship campaign.Accordingly, it goes without saying he was delighted that United’s impressive win over the Jags was in a re-arranged league outing and not the fizzy cup.And for him to be involved so prominently in new boss Robbie Neilson’s first outing in charge was a signicant bonus.“It’s better to be doing well in a league game than the Irn-Bru Cup and I thought all the boys were brilliant against Thistle,” said the former Scotland U  man.“It’s a boost as well to be in the team for the manager’s first game. I’m really thankful to him for giving me it and, hopefully, I took it and did well.“Now we want to follow it up with another good performance against Inverness this week.”McMullan’s sparkling display saw him at the centre of much of United’s attacking display. He also grabbed an assist for the winning goal when Jags keeper Cammy Bell couldn’t hold his shot, allowing Pavol Safranko to net the rebound, making a mockery of last month’s revelation that United were willing to let him go in the summer.At the time he stated his plan was to get his head down and work hard to get back in the side before re-assessing his position during the January transfer window, when he’d be into the last six months of his contract.On that score, nothing has changed but, having been given his chance by the new boss, his hope is regular involvement from now on will see the matter resolved by a new deal at United.And he knows the best way to earn that is via regular performances like his last.“I’ve always had the belief in my ability and what I have to do is keep trying to play well.“On Saturday the manager gave me a more central role and it was good fun. You get a wee bit more of the ball and, when you do get on it, you can go both ways and I enjoyed that.”Even after just a few days working with Neilson, the -year-old is firm in his belief, what’s about to unfold at Tannadice is something every player there will want to be part of.“I think Saturday was a sign of things to come and we’re only going to get better from now on.“All the boys are champing at the bit to be involved and that’s definitely what you want because we’ve got a lot of good players here.“Right from the start on Saturday I thought we looked really good, we were creating chances. One thing where we were maybe lacking was converting them and it’s something we can work on.“But we did create a few, maybe should have had another couple of goals and we had one that was just offside as well and it’s good we’re making them.“We had to battle for the last  minutes or so and you do get a bit nervy when they pull a goal back and because it’s late on you go a bit more defensive.“Probably the fact we’d been so much on top makes you more anxious because you don’t want to throw away two points but we stuck together and saw the game out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sunderland target glen kamara could be bound for euros after scoring first finland goal","story":"Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara could be on his way to the next Euros after helping Finland to another impressive victory.Kamara’s last-minute goal on Monday night – his first for his country – clinched a - victory over Greece in the Ratina Stadium in Tampere.It leaves the Finns with a perfect record after four games and just needing a single point from their final two matches to confirm they’ll top their four-team group.The -year-old – linked with Sunderland at the weekend – came on as a second half sub in a - win over Estonia on Friday night before getting the full  minutes against the Greeks.As well as more than playing his part in helping his nation to their latest successes, that game time should be of benefit to Dundee.Kamara, last season’s star man at Dens Park, has been struggling with an ankle problem since July.He has been back for the Dark Blues’ last three league outings and will have benefited from the extra action while most of his clubmates were having the weekend off.Kamara will be back in time to complete preparations for Saturday’s trip to face in-form Livingston, as should Benjamin Kallman.The striker has also been back in Finland, with their U  squad.They are due in European Championship action against Lithuania tonight.The -year-old wasn’t involved when the Finns, who have no chance of qualying, went down in a home clash with Georgia at the end of last week."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie this is why dundees neil mccann experiment went horribly wrong","story":"That Neil McCann’s turbulent time as Dundee manager has ended can’t come as a surprise after what’s been a disastrous start to the season.And it’s fair to say his reign will go down as an experiment, however bold and well-thought out, that went horribly wrong.When the former Dens favourite was appointed manager on a temporary basis following Paul Hartley’s sacking in April last year, a few eyebrows were raised.Although McCann had the coaching qualications required, the fact was, apart from a brief spell as first-team coach at Dunfermline when more often than not he couldn’t attend games, he had no managerial experience.He was, of course, still very much in the football public’s eye via his work as Sky TV’s top Scottish football pundit.And a very good job he did, talking eloquently and providing expert analysis of the satellite broadcaster’s coverage of the game north of the border.As most managers will tell you, in football, theory and practice are two very dferent things. So it’s proved with the former Scotland star at Dens Park.That he had very definite ideas on how the game should be played was clear, as was the fact he was unlikely to change them.He demanded his team focused on a passing game all over the pitch, making it clear he’d accept responsibilityit meant risks taken in playing the ball out from the back at times led to goals being conceded. Inevitably it did.In fairness to McCann, his arrival did bring about a speedy and necessary improvement and wins over Motherwell and Kilmarnock followed by a draw with Ross County were enough to save the team from relegation in the   season.Two defeats would follow before the end of the campaign and while they were largely irrelevant to a relieved support, they did perhaps suggest to the caretaker boss that, long-term, the changes he wanted to make were going to be too big an ask.That led to a confusing summer that initially saw him announce he did not want the job, moves be made for then-St Mirren boss Jack Ross, before McCann had a change of mind and was appointed on a permanent basis.Crucially, that saw time wasted in undertaking what was a clearly necessary rebuilding of the squad. That left him playing catch-up when it came to new signings.It meant despite talk of better to come, with the exception of a brief spell around February, hopes of a top-six challenge gave way to another battle for survival.It was achieved via three wins from the first four post-split fixtures but, even so, it was clear better was expected this season.Another summer of signings this year gave some hope that would be the case but, although progression from the Betfred Cup group stage was secured, a home defeat at the hands of Championship Dunfermline and a lack of goals were worrying.Performances in opening league games against St Mirren and Aberdeen were decent but both ended in defeat.Then an inept and ill-disciplined display against Ayr in the last  of the Betfred Cup that saw three goals conceded and two red cards had the alarm bells ringing.After that the defeats continued coming. There was brief respite via a solitary success at Hamilton last month but he departs having lost eight of his last nine fixtures.If that was not bad enough, his time in charge saw stories of discord in the dressing-room and bust-ups with ious players during his time in charge didn’t help.Most notably was the argument that led to star goalie Scott Bain’s time at Dens coming to an abrupt end. Now McCann and assistant Graham Gartland have paid the price."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-cinema-to-celebrate-movie-release-with-queen-inspired-evening","story":"QUEEN fans will be treated to a live performance at a Glasgow cinema to celebrate the launch of the new biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody."},{"url":null,"title":"peaky-blinders-star-hails-celtics-kiernan-tierney","story":"A PEAKY Blinders star has praised Celtics Kieran Tierney in a viral video."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-peoples-palace-and-winter-gardens-to-close-indefinitely","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS tourism industry is expected to take a major hit as two popular attractions are set to close indefinitely."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"gary-lewis-to-honour-conscientious-objector-ahead-of-armistice-anniversary","story":"A GLASGOW university will be sharing a letter from its achieve highlighting the struggle of Scotlandrsquos Conscientious Objectors who refused the call to arms in the First World War."},{"url":null,"title":"derek-johnstone-i-hope-supporters-come-out-in-their-numbers-for-david-hagen-this-weekend","story":"I wrote in this column last week that football supporters donrsquot get the credit often enough when they do good and donrsquot get the praise when it is merited."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-to-quiz-glasgow-school-of-art-board-chiefs-after-mack-blaze","story":"MSPs will quiz the chairwoman of the Glasgow School of Art board months after the Mackintosh Building was ripped apart by a blaze."},{"url":null,"title":"strictly-come-dancing-star-kevin-clifton-to-perform-in-rock-of-ages-at-the-kings-theatre","story":"STRICTLY Come Dancing star Kevin Clton will perform in the musical Rock of Ages at the Kings Theatre in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"first-furnishings-goes-into-administration","story":"A FIRM supplying white goods to local authorities has gone into administration at a cost of  jobs."},{"url":null,"title":"gerald-butler-thanks-scots-navy-officers-for-service-amid-clyde-naval-base-film-screening-of-new-flick","story":"MEMBERS of the Royal Navy Submarine Service surfaced on the Clyde for an extra-special advanced showing of Hollywood movie Hunter Killer."},{"url":null,"title":"the-perfume-shop-to-set-up-christmas-pop-ups-around-scotland","story":"A POPULAR perfume shop will pop-up across Scotland this month in a bid to get shoppers Christmas ready."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"AN English couple have decided to raffle off their pound million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117936.jpg","title":"Book festival organisers blown away by participant numbers","story":"THOUSANDS of children took part in a mass reading event to set a new record for an Inverness book festival.A total of  primary pupils across the region read ndash or were read to ndash at the same time to launch NessBookFest which featured a broad programme of almost  free events over four days.Festival committee member and organiser Barbara Henderson was delighted with the numbers taking part in the read-in.\"We were blown away by the response,\" she said. \"Our previous record was only in the high hundreds.

About half of these weddings request an outdoor ceremony.\"Due to poor weather the majority of these end up having to be relocated indoors.\"The statement goes on to say that the hotel chapel \"only hosts  guests, which is often too small to host some ceremonies\".\"As such, they have considered ious options and concluded that the provision of a semi-permanent party tent is the most appropriate option to address this issue.\"However, community councillor Mr Youngson said the scheme had to be rejected.He said Manse Road residents feared it would cause them endless problems and that they would find themselves embroiled in a noise battle with the hotel.\"This is just not on,\" he said.\"Itrsquos so close to the houses.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

This is when you learn your people skills. I was there for three and a half years - you involve yourself with the community - it was just amazing. “It was a highlight for personal reasons, for family reasons, for friends you make for le and for the grounding it gives you in getting to know people. “I came back to Ayr in  as an operational police officer then I left the Division and worked in national security for a while which was really interesting. “It got to  and I wanted to come back to operational policing so I ed to Ayr as an operational inspector. “For the third time in my career, I’m back.

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

HSV, also known as oral herpes, which causes cold sores and blisters around the mouth and on the face and HSV, which is generally responsible for genital herpes outbreaks.Professor Ruth Itzhaki, whohas spent more than  years at the University of Manchester investigating a potential link, looked to Taiwan as few countriescollect the population data required to test the theory.In Taiwan .% of the population is enrolled in a National Health Insurance Research Database, which is being extensively mined for information on microbial infections and disease.In  , three studies were published describing Taiwanese data on the development of senile dementia ndash of which Alzheimerrsquos is the main cause ndash and the treatment of patients with marked overt signs of infection with HSV or icella zoster virus .Prof Itzhaki said:ldquoThe striking results include evidence that the risk of senile dementia is much greater in those who are infected with HSV, and that anti-herpes antiviral treatment causes a dramatic decrease in number of those subjects severely affected by HSV who later develop dementia.ldquoHSV could account for % or more of Alzheimerrsquos disease cases.ldquoIt should be stressed that the results of these Taiwanese studies apply only to severe HSVinfections, which are rare.ldquoIdeally, we would study dementia rates amongst people who have suffered mild HSV infection, including herpes labialis [cold sores] or mild genital herpes, but these are far less likely to be documented.Prof Itzhaki has previously shown that cold sores occur more frequently in carriers of APOE-epsilon ndash a gene iant that increases the risk of Alzheimerrsquos.ldquoOur theory is that in APOE-epsilon carriers, reactivation is more frequent or more harmful in HSV-infected brain cells, which as a result accumulate damage that culminates in development of Alzheimerrsquos, Prof Itzhaki added.ldquoViral DNA is located very specically within plaques in post-mortem brain tissue from Alzheimerrsquos sufferers.ldquoThe main proteins of both plaques and tangles accumulate also in HSV-infected cell cultures ndash and antiviral drugs can prevent this.The Alzheimerrsquos Society said the paper highlightsexisting studies that suggest people who have the herpes virus infection may be more likely to develop dementia, but due to the nature of the research it does not show a cause and effect relationship between herpes and dementia.The charityrsquos head of research, Dr James Pickett, said: ldquoHerpes is a hot topic in dementia research, as the infection appears to be more common in the brains of people with Alzheimerrsquos compared to healthy brains ndash but we donrsquot yet know enough about the relationship between the two.ldquoThe link between herpes and dementia isnrsquot something that we feel people should worry about, although itrsquos sensible general advice to seek treatment for persistent cold sores.ldquoDementia is not contagious and shouldnrsquot be thought of as an infectious disease.ldquoMore research is needed to find out whether antiviral drugs can reduce dementia risk. Someone in the UK develops dementia every three minutes, and our scientists at the UK Dementia Research Institute are working hard to understand why, so that we can find ways to beat it.Dr David Reynolds, chief scientic officer at Alzheimerrsquos Research UK, said: ldquoThis review article discusses previous research linking the herpes viruses to Alzheimerrsquos disease and as such, adds no new evidence to support a link between the two.ldquoResearch into a link between the herpes virus and Alzheimerrsquos is so far very limited, with only a few scientists studying the association. This review presents mainly correlative studies that do not give clear evidence of cause and effect.ldquoA growing body of evidence is linking the immune system with Alzheimerrsquos disease, and itrsquos important to explore the role that inflammation might play in the development and progression of the disease.The research is published inFrontiers in Ageing Neuroscience."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8838357.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"college-support-staff-pay-deal-agreed","story":"Member of trade unions Unison, Unite and GMB voted in favour of a two-and-a-half year deal following negotiations with Colleges Scotland Employersrsquo Association.The unions said it would see pay rise by a minimum of pound, over a -month period.Patricia Murray of Unison said: ldquoThis deal will see over % of our members get a pay rise in each of two years of between % and .%, with gains of up to pound beyond government pay policy at the lower end of the scales.ldquoIt puts pound minimum into pay packets, with pay outs in November , April , and April .Shona Struthers, chief executive of Colleges Scotland Employersrsquo Association, added: ldquoThis agreement is the culmination of a lot of hard work, serious negotiations and compromise by both parties and has delivered the best possible, affordable pay rises and improvements in conditions of service.ldquoThis deal represents a pound million investment in support staff and is a signicant milestone for national bargaining which provides long-term stability and certainty for support staff in colleges across Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8838361.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"no-irish-no-gay-banner-removed-from-motorway-in-northern-ireland","story":"It sparked fury on social media on Friday.No-one has stepped forward to claim responsibility for the banner.It was photographed on a bridge close to Lurgan, Co Armagh on the M, visible from the Belfast-bound lanes on Friday morning.Officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland later removed it, and are now investigating the incident as a suspected hate crime.Bridge  M EastboundThousands of commuters a day Belfast bound greeted with this sickening display.

As it happens, Irsquom with this sentiment. But where we part company is this sense of injustice is not the loudest voice in my head. The voice screaming out is one of worry for the future, for the children who have to grow up in this little indie world which exists without a thought-out economic plan.Could my not pulling on the jersey be down to the fact the SNP wonrsquot reveal a strategy for containing multinational tax dodging, supporting the ailing NHS or determining who will build schools  If I slip on the Scotland jersey am I shedding the warm vest that has been the Barnett Formula Whatrsquos inarguable is we are now a ided, self-centred little nation. In movie imagery terms on the one side are the Brigadooners, , and The Debt Collectors, who believe there is ultimately a price to pay for living on little more than a dream.Meantime, we live in a Scotland in which we are constantly being dabbed with the calamine lotion of liberal policy.

So much of our governmentrsquos policy is displacement activity.

Therersquos the worry London mayor Sadiq Khan may be right when he connects nationalism with racism. Therersquos a concern that when hermetic Nationalists valorise Scotland and demand separation from England it implies that England is somehow less. If we care about social justice and egalitarianism why does it need to stop at Carlisle This somehow sits at odds with the times of those early Scotland strips being worn when the essence of being Scottish was summed up by someone such as Jimmy Reid.

Tory Brexiteers branded it Brusselsrsquo blackmail, warning it would mean billions more British taxpayersrsquo money flowing into EU coffers as the country effectively remained in the customs union and single market.Time is now running short.

At his press conference, the French President declared: ldquoIts now very clearly up to the British Prime Minister and her staff to come back with a solution based on the necessary political compromise on the UK side.\"He stressed Brexit was no longer a technical issue and the ball was in the UK court. ldquoItrsquos not for the EU to make concessions to deal with UK political issues.

If extending transition period makes withdrawal agreement easier to agree, it should be welcomed.\"Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said: ldquoMore than two years after the referendum, the Tories still have no credible plan to deliver Brexit.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am. A soup and sandwich lunch will be served at .pm after the event ends.To book your place in this free event, contact Age Scotland on    or helen.simpson@agescotland.org.uk by October .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A knock-on effect may also be the closure of the palace, although Glasgow City Council still hopes to prevent this.: Glasgow’s People’s Palace and Winter Gardens to close ‘indefinitely’Councillors all over Scotland will sympathise, given the pressures they have been under in recent years.Local authority spending on frontline services like school support, children’s services, rubbish disposal and social care has fallen by nearly £ million over the past five years – a . per cent cut that has been contrasted with the . per cent reduction in the Scottish Government’s revenue budget. The figures prompted local government body Cosla to complain in May that councils had “suffered the brunt of cuts” and had “no room left to manoeuvre in terms of budgets”.The Scottish Government, meanwhile, has sought to leave such complaints at the door of Theresa May according to Bute House, this is Tory, not SNP, austerity.For her part, the Prime Minister recently made an even more optimistic pledge than her predecessor, declaring the end of austerity was within our grasp –only the right Brexit deal could be struck.However, the closure of the People’s Palace would be a powerful symbol that our economic woes are very much still with us and that it is the “people” who continue to pay the highest price. The museum is famously home to Sir Billy Connolly’s ‘big banana boots’, but it also details the lives of everyday working-class Scots. One of its highlights is the Single End display, showing a typical single-roomed house of the s, where a family would eat, sleep, cook and wash. It acts as a reminder that austerity today is still an improvement on the past, but also a warning of how much worse le can be.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC.

They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1093314.jpg--.jpg?1539853794000\n","title":"is kilrea road sliding away","story":"Concerns have been raised about a section of the Kilrea Road where subsidence has caused the footpath to crack. TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston was contacted by local residents about the problem as they feared the footpath and road were not structurally safe.Councillor Gaston fears that the problem is now getting worse and is urging the Roads Department to act. Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , . Marie McGrattanand Frances Donnelly , daughters of the owner Sam Casey, were also murdered in the incident.On Sunday afternoon, a commemorative plaque will be erected at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown at pm in memory of Gerard and Thomas who grew up in the area.A tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends will then be launched in the Mission to Seafarers Centre.The book, entitled ‘Ifs and Buts and the Toss of a Coin’ is a collection of humble and human stories about Thomas and Gerard as told by their friends and heartbroken family members.Brian Quinn, who has helped organised the event with the Docksiders Senior Men’s Group and friends of Thomas and Gerard, is hoping Sunday will be a fitting tribute.“It will be a nice day. We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity. On the day Gerard was laid to rest, his friend Mitch decided to hop on the back of a lorry after the funeral which was heading back into town. As the lorry approached Millfield, Mitch lost his balance and fell from the lorry and was killed.The public are asked to assemble at St Joseph’s Church on Princes Dock Street on Sundayat pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two hundred jobs created at springfield factory in two years","story":"THE Innovation Factory in West Belfast is celebrating the creation of more than  jobs on its second anniversary.The business hub on the Springfield Road opened in October  with the aim of encouraging entrepren-eurship, innovation, and helping new high-tech businesses to grow.The  businesses located at Innovation Factory are some of the most ground-breaking, innovative companies in the north dealing in areas such as G technology, software development, film production and digital applications.Majella Barkley, Innovation Director, said: “The key to the success of Innovation Factory has been flexibility and support modern businesses need to be able to change and adapt their environment rapidly.

Judges unanimously agreed the bakery had objected to the message and not the messenger. Last night, Ashers said the company is trading well, and the decision not to renew the lease on the Royal Avenue branch of the bakery chain was based purely on specic commercial considerations relating to that outlet.General manager Daniel McArthur said: \"It simply comes down to the figures. \"We decided not to renew the lease. \"Belfast city centre isnt busy enough - our other shops are much busier.\" Mr McArthur added: \"Its been planned for some time, and I am pleased to say there will be no job losses.\"The Royal Avenue outlet is one of nine retail sites operated by the company in the east Antrim and Belfast area.News of the Ashers closure comes as city centre traders say the once-vibrant shopping heart of the city has become a ghost town in the wake of the devastating Bank Buildings blaze.A security cordon ensures pedestrians and shoppers are kept away from the gutted former Primark store - but it also prevents them reaching the many shops close to the charred Castle Junction ruin.Some businesses have called for the building to be pulled down immediately to mitigate the economic impact.However, it is understood any demolition project would be signicantly complicated by safety concerns around the huge structure.Heritage campaigners have called for the listed building to be saved.Primark itself has contributed half a million pounds to help traders affected by the blaze and the subsequent security ring of steel.

NI-Scotland bridge definitely can be done, says leading UK architect  Bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland could create Celtic powerhouseThe DUPs transport spokesperson wrote about the plan in the latest issue of The House, the parliamentary magazine. Former DUP Health Minister Simon Hamilton previously backed the plan in an article for The Belfast .Boris Johnson, a former UK Foreign Secretary said the plan should be seriously considered by the UK government.Alan Dunlop, an academic from Liverpool University suggested the bridge could be between Larne and the village of Portpatrick in south west Scotland, or between Torr Head on the Antrim Coast and the Mull of Kintyre.The cost of the project has been estimated at £ billion.In his article Mr Girvan pointed out that the idea of connecting the two countries was discussed as far back as the s when a tunnel was discussed. He said that his party did not \"pretend to know all the answers\" but that a feasibility study would help find out the realities of building the bridge.\"Across the world, bridges and tunnels have been constructed which only a decade or two earlier would have been ruled impossible or impractical. Technology moves on and we in the United Kingdom should not self-censor ambition,\" the South Antrim MP wrote. Paul GirvanMr Girvan said that similar projects like the Oresund bridge linking Denmark and Sweden showed the potential benefits of such a project.He also admitted that as a unionist \"there will always be an attraction in seeing a physical connection between Northern Ireland and Great Britain\".\"It is not without signicance, either, that the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney welcomed the idea of investigating the feasibility of such a scheme. Those making the crossing would not just come from Northern Ireland it would also be an important connection between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain,\" Mr Girvan wrote.\"There are many ambitious projects that we can look back on today and admire the foresight of those who saw a vision become reality. None of them would have happenedthe initial proposals were rejected without even receiving proper consideration.\"As we leave the European Union, the DUP has been clear that there should be no border erected down the Irish Sea. Instead of placing barriers between parts of the United Kingdom we should be building bridges.\"  "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic updates delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

A number of openings in the glasshouses were also repaired with broken panes replaced.Consultants have been appointed to conduct a series of studies at the forest park and in addition to the Arboretum and Annesley Garden, have been focusing on the parkrsquos bioersity and built heritage, traffic and car parking as part of the funding application process.Earlier this year, a study highlighted a wider entrance to the sprawling forest park and the development of an interpretative centre beside the Walled Garden.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.Initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Beaches among top with bathing water in Europe  ","story":"FOUR local beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it has been revealed.Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough are among a group of  beaches which have come top of the excellent water quality class, but it is a case of must do better for Newcastle beach where the water quality is labelled ldquosufficient.Tyrella and Murlough already hold the prestigious blue flag awards for the quality of their beaches with those who live along the Lecale coastline mdash who have been working to improve both Kilclief and Ballyhornan mdash delighted the beaches were identied for inspection for the first time, with the water quality included in the excellent category alongside beaches like Castlerock, Benone, Portballintrae and Portstewart.The districtrsquos beaches provide an excellent opportunity for people to get out and explore the arearsquos unique geological heritage and enjoy a wide range of activities which are available.Blue flag status assures visitors that the beaches have excellent water quality, are clean and that the environment is safe and accessible.The latest water quality figures published by the Department of the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsshow that the local beaches rank alongside some of the Provincersquos best, in particular, those along the North Coast and North Downrsquos so-called gold coast.A total of  bathing waters around the Provincersquos coastline have met strict European standards for quality, with  of these classied as excellent, which is the prerequisite for the coveted blue flag award.A further six beaches met the lsquogoodrsquo standards and the rest mdash including Newcastle mdash were placed in the lsquosufficientrsquo standard category alongside Crawfordsburn, Carnlough and Cloughey.David Small, head of DAERArsquos Environment, Marine and Fisheries Group, has welcomed the publication of the latest water quality results.He said: ldquoThis is a superb result for our beaches, especially given the changeable weather our coastline is often subject to. But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort. We will continue to work to reduce water pollution to keep our bathing waters clean and safe.Mr Small added: ldquoOur beaches are a priceless resource to tourism and to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike.

Therefore I appeal to those who have money to invest it in creating jobs for our youth.Dr Maguire said economists were painting ldquogloomy pictures of the economic system and were warning that levels of unemployment had become ldquoendemic.ldquoIn particular the level of youth unemployment is rising rapidly and it seems certain that growing numbers of our school leavers are destined to move directly to the dole queue, he stressed.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle receptionist Dolores Malone is the top hotel receptionist in Co Down and now she has the chance to prove that she is also the best in Northern Ireland when she takes place in the Coca-Cola Receptionist of the Year finals night in the Culloden Hotel next month.Dolores, receptionist at the Brook Cottage Hotel, won her way through to the finals by beating receptionists from hotels in Co Down and Co Armagh in the regional heat at the White Gables Hotel in Hillsborough.Dolores goes forward to compete for a pound holiday cheque, a specially engraved Tyrone Crystal vase and specially designed winnerrsquos badge and a framed certicate.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has won her fight to have a five year-old girl transported to school in Dundrum.The girl, who lives near Castlewellan, began her first year of education at Dundrum Primary School on Monday and special transport arrangements have been laid on for her.ldquoThe girl is now being lted by minibus at her front door each day and is also brought back home.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children. All this needs to stop and people want to see police doing more, he added.Jeanette McCarthy, chairwoman of the Tosuacute Uacuter residentsrsquo group which includes the Lynn Doyle area, revealed parents were afraid to let their children out to play in the evening.She added: ldquoThere is just no way we can let our children play around the parklands below the Cathedral.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

He knew myself and my friends and was a really friendly man.\"He always used to know what ice lollies we would each have, see us crossing over and put them on the counter ready.\"Mr Pontis suffered a stroke after falling in his garden in spring , and later had three small heart attacks and three bouts of pneumonia.He pulled through each time, but caught pneumonia for a fourth time and died on Friday September .His funeral was held at St Peterrsquos Church in Cardf on Tuesday October , before he was buried at Thornhill Cemetery.Ms Sakke called the service was ldquolovely.ldquoThe priest who led the service had lived in Rome and so did some of it in Italian, she added. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Someone in the UK develops dementia every three minutes, and our scientists at the UK Dementia Research Institute are working hard to understand why, so that we can find ways to beat it.Dr David Reynolds, chief scientic officer at Alzheimerrsquos Research UK, said: ldquoThis review article discusses previous research linking the herpes viruses to Alzheimerrsquos disease and as such, adds no new evidence to support a link between the two.ldquoResearch into a link between the herpes virus and Alzheimerrsquos is so far very limited, with only a few scientists studying the association. This review presents mainly correlative studies that do not give clear evidence of cause and effect.ldquoA growing body of evidence is linking the immune system with Alzheimerrsquos disease, and itrsquos important to explore the role that inflammation might play in the development and progression of the disease.The research is published inFrontiers in Ageing Neuroscience..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New evidence of a causal link between herpes viruses and Alzheimer us article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent.

We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
