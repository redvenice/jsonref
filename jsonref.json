Guns and liquor were banned and cellphone signals were jammed in parts of Manila.Devotees who were pushed back when they tried to touch the statue complained, but despite the security and the tropical heat, mobs of people dangerously squeezed into a tight pack of humanity around the carriage. They threw small towels at volunteers on the carriage for them to wipe parts of the statue and toss the towels back, believing the Nazarene\u0027s powers can cure ailments and do other miracles.Dozens of people fainted or sustained injuries and were carried away on stretchers by Red Cross volunteers.Jocelyn del Rosario, a 55-year-old restaurant manager, said she walked barefoot for more than 4 kilometers (2.6 miles) on an empty stomach to show her devotion to the Black Nazarene and pray for her children.

Some believe the statue\u0027s endurance, from fires and earthquakes through the centuries and intense bombings during World War II, is a testament to its powers.The spectacle reflects the unique brand of Catholicism, which includes folk superstitions, in Asia\u0027s largest Catholic nation. Dozens of Filipinos have themselves nailed to crosses on Good Friday in another tradition that draws huge crowds and tourists each year.Such religious passion has continued in the Philippines even as President Rodrigo Duterte has stepped up attacks in recent years on the church and bishops, who have criticized the thousands of killings under his anti-drug crackdown. Duterte sparked outrage among many Catholics two years ago when he called God \u0027stupid\u0027 and later questioned the basic tenets of the faith.

Lots of towns and villages host winter festivals and parades one of the biggest is the Festivalul de Datini și Obiceiuri Strămoșești (the festival of customs and ancestors’ customs) in Comănești on 30 December. Different groups come from miles around to participate, and it has become best known for its bear dancers: groups who process through the streets in bear costumes, often made from real animal furs, some as much as 50 years old.The bear was a sacred animal in ancient Romania. It’s thought that the tradition of dancing bears originated many centuries ago among the Roma who would visit villages just before New Year with real bears on leashes to dance and chase away bad spirits from the outgoing year. When the country was under communist rule, it was banned bear dancing was made illegal in 1998 and, when Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, the last of the dancing bears were bought from their owners and “retired” to a bear reserve in the Rila mountains.As well as the “bears” in Comănești’s festival, each group will also have someone playing the “Gypsy” andor “The Bear Tamer”, plus musicians with drums and panpipes. Everyone dances and sings as they go through the streets, making their way to a stage where they act out a simple ritual scene in which the bear collapses because a demon is inside him. The Gypsy comes with a knife and bleeds the bear, lets the demon out and the bear revives. It’s a story of rebirth for the new year. In some versions of the tradition, the bear, the Gypsy and the drummers also go from house to house in the village, singing and dancing to ward off evil and bring good luck.I didn’t go to the festival as a child. Photography has helped me discover my country in a fuller way. I live in the UK now but have been to Comănești and the region five times over the past decade to photograph the festivals. This shot was from 2013. It’s mostly men and boys who dress up in the bear skins, but I have seen girls, too. The boy is wearing a real bear skin that would have been very old and very heavy – some of them weigh up to 50kg - and also very hot.It’s really hard to shoot a procession. You can either sprint ahead and wait for the group, or walk backwards in front of them. I prefer that way, but you can’t then see where you’re going and I’m always praying I’m not going to step on something or trip.I’d spotted this boy earlier – sometimes the dancers take the masks off because they get too hot – and was struck by something about his expression. There are lots of photographers at the event, so the boy knew I was shooting him but didn’t take any notice of me. He was flushed because he’d been dancing and running all day, and there was this one moment when he was looking in my direction. I didn’t realise at the time I’d got such a good shot.When I photograph, I’m always so immersed in what I’m doing that I don’t stop to consider what I’ve taken. I just try to get as many shots as possible – if you stop you risk missing things. You never know what’s round the corner. When I look at the photo now, the only thing I regret is the lack of snow. There’s usually snow on the ground at the time, but climate change is affecting Romania’s weather like everywhere else, and the snow often comes in March rather than DecemberJanuary.This picture has changed my life. It won a National Geographic Traveller UK competition. Part of my prize was a trip to the Maasai Mara, where I’d always dreamed of going. It has brought me international recognition and commissions, and has also helped make the festival famous all over the world. It’s even live on Facebook these days. I heard about someone coming from Japan to see it. Last year, I met the mayor of Comănești, and to my amazement he gave me a big hug!I’m fascinated by traditions and costumes. In a costume you can be something other than yourself. In recent visits to the region’s winter festivals, I’ve also focused on a portraiture series, asking people in their colourful costumes to pose for me in front of a mobile studio. I came across one bear costume made entirely of reeds that weighed 100kg. Other costumes (there can be horses, deer and goats as well as bears) are made of rags or paper, while some people paint their faces or wear really elaborate masks or pointed hats that are a metre high.Many Romanians who work abroad return each year specifically to take part in the winter festivals – it’s how they express and celebrate their cultural identity. There’s always an amazing vibe in Comănești. I dance, too – you feel so much energy. Whenever I photograph, whatever my subject, I try to bring a good energy to it, but here it was easy.• See more images at Alecsandra Raluca Drăgoi’s website.Trained: BA in photography, Portsmouth University MA in documentary photography and photojournalism, Westminster University.High point: “Winning the Sony awards’ youth category in 2013 and National Geographic Traveller UK in 2015.

Ikea owns 44 malls worldwide but has built these itself, rather than buying up existing centres.In October, Ikea said it had bumped up its property team in the UK with the aim of capitalising on the decreased valuations of many shopping centres prompted by numerous closures of high street chain stores.The company is thought to be looking at further shopping sites across the UK as a way to get its hands on sites for its smaller, more accessible stores in city centre locations.It is unlikely to face much competition for targets from institutional investors, which are shying away from the retail sector in the face of the rapidly changing market and declining values.Thousands of high street jobs have been lost this year as a result of high profile retail administrations and thousands more are at risk as Mothercare, Debenhams and Forever 21 prepare for closures.

Bought by Sports Direct and 98 stores are still trading in the UK and Ireland.Spudulike: Closed all 37 stores with the loss of about 300 jobs when it went into administration in August.Bathstore: Had 132 stores and 529 staff when it went into administration in June. Homebase bought 44 stores saving 154 jobs and the brand now trades from 28 stores.Select: Had 180 stores and 2,000 employees when the fashion retailer went into administration in May. In June administrators at advisory firm Quantuma carried out a CVA closing 11 stores with the loss of about 200 jobs.Debenhams: Had 166 department stores and more than 25,000 employees when went into administration in April. No store closed immediately and the chain is now owned by its lenders but two will close before Christmas and another 20 in January when the group completes a rescue restructure expected to result in the loss of 1,200 jobs.Pretty Green: Had 12 stores and about 170 employees when Liam Gallagher’s fashion outlet went into administration in March.

The brand was bought by its Chinese franchise partner, Rebecca Feng, saving 21 stores, all the group’s concessions and 325 jobs. But more than 100 jobs lost with the closure of 15 stores.Patisserie Valerie: Had 200 cafes employing nearly 3,000 people when an accounting scandal prompted the chain to call in administrators in January. About 70 of the group’s 200 stores closed immediately with the loss of 900 jobs. About 2,000 jobs were saved when about 100 Patisserie Valerie cafes were rescued by Causeway Capital, more than 20 of which have since closed. 21 Philpotts sandwich shops were bought by AF Blakemore \u0026amp Son. and four Baker \u0026amp Spice cafes a were bought by the Department of Coffee \u0026amp Social Affairs.

More of our customers are living in cities than ever before and a regenerated Kings Mall will be an ideal location for reaching millions of Londoners.”The retailer opened its first city centre site in the UK on central London’s Tottenham Court Road in 2018 and has since opened another in Bromley, south-east London.Both those sites are “planning studios” that enable shoppers to get advice on kitchen and bathroom overhauls. The Hammersmith store, which will open in spring next year, will be different as it will stock more than 2,000 home-furnishing accessories available to take away immediately.The company said Swedish food, including its famous meatballs, will be on offer within Kings Mall as part of its plans to redevelop the centre.Peter Jelkeby, the country retail manager of Ikea UK \u0026amp Ireland, said: “We continue to respond to people’s evolving shopping habits, making Ikea more convenient than ever before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7062addf2293a14725a77790b8a6041ef173d5/134_0_2088_1253/master/2088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6fec88c1f53b1f0c3fffc3b98764e00","title":"marks spencer sales dented by too many mince pies and skinny jeans","story":"Shares slide as stock-buying errors and rivals’ Christmas discounts dent performanceMarks \u0026amp Spencer shares have fallen sharply after its Christmas sales were dented by rivals’ discounts as well as its own buying mistakes after it stocked up on too many men’s skinny jeans.A pickup in trade in M\u0026ampS food halls over the holiday period helped the high street retailer deliver its first positive quarterly sales in three years but the success of its resurgent food ision was overshadowed by higher levels of waste, which eroded profitability.The chief executive, Steve Rowe, said its clothing ision had faced a challenging trading environment in the lead-up to Christmas: “There was unprecedented discounting by competitors between Black Friday and Christmas and that made December a challenging month and affected our gifting sales.”The revamp involved replacing some regular “relaxed” fit trousers with slim and skinny options but the sartorial leap proved too dramatic for its customer base, with the new lines ending up on sale rails. We “got the balance wrong”, Rowe admitted.The GlobalData analyst Kate Ormrod said it was clear M\u0026ampS “remains unable to excite shoppers enough to buy”.

Typically represented as percentage growth rates, like-for-like sales measure sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, stripping out the impact of sales at newer stores. The idea is that they allow a more transparent comparison of a retailer’s sales performance over a certain period of time, when compared with the same period of time a year earlier.However, there is no formal industry standard. This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher. Critics of the measure say that like-for-like sales do not always give an accurate picture of a retailer’s health. They argue that of greater relevance is profitability and how well a company is adapting to challenges such as the living wage and online shopping revolution.Greggs’ 25,000 employees will be handed a special £7m bonus – up to £300 each – in their pay packets this month after the bakery chain’s vegan sausage roll led to bumper sales and profits.German discounter Aldi booked more than £1bn in sales for the first time in the four weeks to Christmas Eve as sales of alcohol, meat and premium ranges did well.Majestic Wine reported bumper Christmas sales as Britons celebrated with English wine, crémant and spiced rum.Analysts said its wide range and affordable prices had helped Dunelm lure customers from struggling rivals such as John Lewis.The online wine retailer is spending less than expected on attracting new customers (towards the bottom end of its £20m-£25m range), which will flow through to higher profit for the year. Investec, the house broker, estimates a £2.5m boost to profits. The company’s chief executive, Rowan Gormley, has stood down and replaced by Nick Devlin as of Thursday, following the sale of the Majestic business with its high street stores.John Lewis will decide in February whether to ditch its annual bonus for the first time in 67 years, which would be a big blow to its 81,000 employees.

Let me take you to a place where the political terrain is so radically different as to be idyllic. In this land, rows of cheap starter homes neatly line the blossoming streets of new garden cities, and no twentysomething frets about getting on to the housing ladder. Not a solitary infant goes to bed hungry. And when you or your loved ones fall ill, a trusty family doctor is on call from 8am to 8pm, all seven days of the week.Already I hear you rumbling like a famished teen at Nando’s: where is this paradise? Sweden or, at the outside, Singapore? No, my friend: it is the UK in 2020. Or at least, it was supposed to be, because all of those treasures and so many more were promised to arrive by this year by the serious, sober all-powerfuls who run the country.Remember Gordon Brown? Practically the first thing he did on becoming prime minister in 2007 was vow to build an extra 3m homes by 2020. Many would nestle in 10 new “eco-towns”, into which he pumped millions of taxpayer pounds. Big, bold and more sprawling than Jacob Rees-Mogg on a parliamentary bench, it was a classic Brown plan. Except at the finish line we can see that not a single eco-town ever got off the drawing board, while the UK has built only 1.9m homes. Far from being fixed, the housing crisis has grown.Another scheme that never got beyond a slogan was Tony Blair’s cast-iron guarantee in 1999 that within two decades no child would live in poverty. Ambitious and inspiring, it was soon dropped and replaced with a more modest target. And that seven-day GP service was dreamed up by David Cameron, who guaranteed it would be UK-wide by this year. Then again, this was the same man who planned to remain prime minister until 2020.No other year has been as loaded up with targets, goals and predictions as 2020. Over the past two decades, governments red and blue have regularly given their grandest objectives this deadline – near enough to imagine yet sufficiently far away not to act. And so the most prophecy-laden year of the century is also the one that will most brazenly shortchange us.Time after time, some beleaguered secretary of state has delivered a speech or released a strategy that swept the thorniest problems in his or her portfolio into a “2020 vision”. It wins them headlines and buys them breathing space and in a more serious political culture they would now be being held to account. But no – because this is Britain. So let us count our squandered inheritance.Let’s remind ourselves how Brown once pledged that in 2020 no car showroom in the country would sell new gas guzzlers, only electrics or hybrids. Or his 2010 assurance that by now every home in the country would enjoy superfast broadband, with the UK outstripping Silicon Valley to become “the world leader in the digital economy”. Whatever you thought of Jeremy Corbyn’s free broadband offer at last month’s election, history reminds us that some ideas just keep coming around, like orphaned suitcases on an airport carousel.As chancellor, George Osborne swore he would pull government finances back into the black by 2020 – an oath that became government policy in 2015, only to become history the year after. Hopped up on his “march of the makers”, he launched a crusade to double the value of UK exports up to £1 trillion by this year. He must have known it was pie in the sky. At £675bn, today’s export total is stuck far below his target while the UK’s trade deficit continues to balloon.I could carry on in this fashion, a journalist playing skittles with Westminster’s failed resolutions and asking Dude, where’s my utopia?But that ducks the bigger question: what damage have these broken promises done to our politics? All the pledges were made long before the all-out lie-fest that was the EU referendum of 2016. None were stuck on a fibbing bus. Yet government ministers must have made many of these solemn vows with fingers crossed behind their backs. In their corner were civil servants forsworn from peddling porkies. Former mandarin Jill Rutter describes Whitehall’s justification for this reciprocal make-believe as: “We won’t tell you that it can’t be done if you won’t sack us when it’s not done.” And she is only half joking.Perhaps it helps that every two-bit consultancy and business guru has wallowed in 2020-ism. In 1998, the Henley Centre predicted that by today “the longest commuter journey will be just under two hours, mainly for the very wealthy using the space shuttle”. Yes, it did really predict that. Countless managers have used the year as the peg for some catastrophic transformation, such as those at Manchester University who embarked upon a “2020 strategy” promising to improve staff satisfaction while driving up earnings. Instead, the university starts this decade at war with swaths of its workforce and clunking through vanity building projects even while its credit rating keeps slipping.Tying this together is a belief in what the Henley forecasters dubbed “friction-free capitalism”. The 2020-ers thought they had capitalism sussed. Nowhere on their horizons was there a global banking crash, let alone a lost decade. Add to that a belief among Blair and his heirs that they also knew how to win at politics. This school of thought focused on retail and salesmanship – which, as University of East Anglia professor of political theory Alan Finlayson observes, were driven by big “offers” designed to grab headlines rather than worrying too hard about delivery.Yet even while Blair and Brown, Cameron and Osborne were staring into the middle distance and describing the shimmering visions ahead, their voters saw institution after institution engulfed by crisis: high-street banks, MPs over expenses, the press with phone-hacking, local councils and public services butchered by cuts.What value in a glorious future when the present is so chaotic? What’s the point of grand designs drawn up in Westminster when daily life for the public is a prosaic mess? In that gulf has bred the nihilism that threads through Brexit alongside contempt for politicians, now seen as so untrustworthy that one might as well stick a serial liar in No 10. Boris Johnson famously loves a legacy project – an airport island here, a garden bridge there. The difference this time is that when our blonde Nero promises voters a grand target, not even his own side will waste a second believing it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8287a7864c6247653b957ac4b986b5498c2adbd2/563_203_3633_2180/master/3633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0ab510830740543f5e36d5383d6e864","title":"quorn to be first major brand to introduce carbon labelling","story":"Carbon footprint data will help customers understand environmental impact of food﻿Quorn is to become the first major brand to introduce carbon labelling on its products.The new labels, aimed at helping consumers understand the environmental impact of their shopping, will start appearing on some products from June and on the entire Quorn range by next year.From Thursday, the “farm to shop” carbon footprint data, certified by the Carbon Trust, will be available online for Quorn’s 30 best-selling products.Quorn claims to be the first meat-free food manufacturer to achieve third-party certification of its carbon footprint figures – via the Carbon Trust – which is being integrated into its own food labelling.The most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet revealed that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way in which consumers can reduce their environmental impact, with animal agriculture a significant and fast-growing source of global greenhouse gas emissions.But while Quorn’s products may now be part of a booming industry of meat alternatives – and a key ingredient in Greggs’ new vegan steak bake – that has not stemmed criticism that they are heavily processed and a far cry from natural, plant-based foods.Peter Harrison, chief executive of Quorn Foods, said: “This is about giving people the information needed to make informed decisions about the food they eat and the effect it has on our planet’s climate – in the same way that nutrition information is clearly labelled to help inform decisions on health.”Manufacturers are stepping up efforts to give consumers more information about the environmental impact of their products, despite previous attempts ending in failure. The UK’s largest retailer Tesco, for example, dropped its plan to label all its products with their carbon footprint, after promising “a revolution in green consumption”, blaming the work involved and other supermarkets for failing to follow its lead.Carbon Trust research in 2019 found that two-thirds of consumers support the idea of a recognisable carbon label to demonstrate that products have been made with a commitment to measuring and reducing their carbon footprint.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e063fe48217feef4bd3c1b829d793ccdae7cd07d/0_10_1166_700/master/1166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=475a012fdbaa89bf7994a10474fefbaa","title":"brazil orders netflix remove gay jesus comedy first temptation christ","story":"Rio judge’s ruling follows complaint that the ‘honour of millions of Catholics’ was hurt by The First Temptation of ChristA Brazilian judge on Wednesday ordered Netflix to stop showing a Christmas special that some called blasphemous for depicting Jesus as a gay man and which prompted a bomb attack on the satirists behind the programme.The ruling by a Rio de Janeiro judge, Benedicto Abicair, responded to a petition by a Brazilian Catholic organisation that argued the “honour of millions of Catholics” was hurt by the airing of The First Temptation of Christ. The special was produced by the Rio-based film company Porta dos Fundos, whose headquarters was targeted in the Christmas Eve attack.Netflix told the Associated Press it would not comment on the ruling. Porta dos Fundos also declined to comment on the judge’s decision, which contradicted an earlier decision rejecting censorship of the programme. The ruling is valid until another court orders otherwise.Abicair said the programme’s withdrawal “is beneficial not only to the Christian community, but to Brazilian society which is mostly Christian”.The ruling comes at a time when Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of waging a “cultural war,” cutting funding for arts projects that “challenge Christian values” and inveighing against flamboyant carnival celebrations. The president’s son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, had called the film “garbage” and said the film-makers “do not represent Brazilian society”.The day before Christmas, a group of hooded men attacked the headquarters of Porta dos Fundos with Molotov cocktails. No one was hurt. A video circulating days later on social media showed three men claiming responsibility for the attack.The First Temptation of Christ depicts Jesus returning home on his 30th birthday and implies he is gay.

He helped shape one of the most revolutionary films of the 1960s (The Graduate), co-wrote one of the funniest of all time (What’s Up, Doc?) and scripted the movie that became the springboard for Nicole Kidman’s career (To Die For). Each new wave of comic talent took it in turn to pay tribute to Henry in some way Tina Fey, who cast him as her character Liz Lemon’s badly behaved father in 30 Rock, was only the most recent.Henry was the fourth writer to try to adapt Charles Webb’s 1963 novella The Graduate, about an aimless young man who drifts into an affair with an older married woman, and he was instrumental in making drastic tonal and narrative changes that transformed the main character from a self-righteous homophobe to a plaintive and over-earnest young twit who is confounded by adult hypocrisy, his own impossibly high standards and the nebulousness of his privileged west coast surroundings. Henry, whose previous experience had included co-creating the hit TV spy spoof Get Smart and appearing on chat shows posing as a campaigner fighting to keep animals clothed (“A nude horse is a rude horse”), was brought on to The Graduate by the director, Mike Nichols, himself an accomplished comic improviser from his double-act with Elaine May. Working together, they created comic dynamite from the generational rupture between the youth of the 1960s and their Eisenhower-era parents, and found their ideal lead in the gawky newcomer Dustin Hoffman.Most screenwriters are unseen if not unsung but Henry was unusual in being constantly visible: long after his stint as the president of the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals, he was industrious in front of the camera as well as behind the typewriter. He was an accomplished actor, providing the connection between any number of disparate figures in the Venn diagram of 20th-century cinema: he was the attorney in bottle-glass specs who goes into business with an alien played by David Bowie in Nicolas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth, the mob accountant murdered at the start of John Cassavetes’ Gloria and, best of all, a middle-class Manhattan parent who cuts loose and samples the counterculture in Milos Forman’s playful 1971 comedy Taking Off. Henry also turns up as himself in the long, single-take opening of Robert Altman’s The Player, where he is seen shamelessly pitching a sequel to The Graduate: “Mrs Robinson has had a stroke, so she can’t talk…”His career was not short of highlights but the 1972 delirious screwball comedy What’s Up, Doc?, which he wrote after the director Peter Bogdanovich was reportedly unhappy with the original draft by the Bonnie and Clyde writers Robert Benton and David Newman, was one of which he was rightly proud.“What’s Up, Doc? makes me totally happy in a way that the other films I’ve written don’t, because Bogdanovich was so good at doing that tone,” Henry said. “I have no qualms about any sequence in it. They all seem to me to work on their own level. It’s a very cartoony, superficial level, but it’s at also very complicated technically. And it’s interesting to see it work out. It’s great fun. It’s very hard to do but it’s great fun to do. And when it works it’s kind of a revelation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a89d20018dfaf02968a137e2def3af3bad99f7/342_354_3784_2270/master/3784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1922f6c469308b260d79d5020d9d8569","title":"david athertons recipe for healthier flapjacks","story":"The 2019 GBBO winner starts his fortnightly column with date-based flapjacks to give you an energy boostFlapjacks used to be my go-to for a sugar hit when doing exercise, but the butter and syrup used traditionally can leave you feeling cheated out of the hard work you are putting in. This recipe tastes decadent, but uses whizzed dates, prune juice and oil to create an emulsion that binds the mix without syrup or eggs.

This recipe uses medjool dates as they have a rich, chewy texture. Deglet noor (regular) dates are smaller and don’t provide that viscous binding needed to mimic the syrup.

In the 00s, for a brief time, there was a website you could go to when you had made too much lamb cobbler (say), so you could take it round to a neighbour who was too frazzled or infirm to make one of their own. It was the most charming idea, which never took off: you would log on, and the nearest taker would be in Birmingham, or a vegetarian, or they had made a stew of their own. It was like some ancient barter system gone wrong, where everybody was making weapons but nobody was breeding any rabbits.That’s the first app someone should invent this decade: leftovers sharing that actually works. If Zipcar works (it really shouldn’t, on paper, driving off and leaving cars at random – the entire fleet ought to wind up outside the same bar), somebody can tackle food. Ideally, it would team up with a driving app so you could leave your casserole in a hire car, though I left some taramasalata in a glove compartment once and that went really badly for me. People still talk about how disgusting I am.It would also be great to get an alert when you are about to run out of Nutella. If they can predict how you will vote, based on the fact that you watch Stranger Things and own leggings, this must be possible. At the moment, it always comes as the most stunning surprise, like running out of pets, or eyebrow.It is amazing how much food knowledge is still passed around by the most ancient technology, word of mouth: even prayer circles have embraced the modernity of the telephone, and yet I still have to be in my friend’s actual house before I discover that Sainsbury’s has pomelos in limited supply and I should get down there. (Somewhere between a grapefruit and an orange, the pomelo is mainly remarkable for the fact that it is gigantic, yet still delicious imagine if a chunky KitKat tasted as good as a regular KitKat, only bigger? That’s the experience I’m talking about.) Likewise, recipes: their sheer proliferation has created a wall of noise. It’s impossible to distinguish whether you really do need to source some saba or they have just added it for a USP. So you fall back on things that people you know have tasted, passing round photographs of scraps of paper, like the 50s with extra WhatsApp. There is plainly room, here, for an online community where you recommend only things that are unusually good, and anyone found posting anything less than that gets pilloried and excluded, like Mumsnet without the Boden and the weird sexual hypermorality.New-decade newsflash: everybody loves chickpeas. People who think they don’t have just eaten too much hummus. They have it all, each little bullet a mountain range of textures. Like the world’s best boyfriend, they get along with everything but are also brilliant on their own. They are highly portable if you have the right Tupperware and I believe them to be quite good for you, though to go on about it would be to sideline their value as delicious things to eat. The puzzle, then, is why we don’t eat them all day long. You can go quite a long time without one before you notice. So someone should invent a Fitbit, only for chickpeas instead of steps.There’s a saying in fashion that, starting on New Year’s Day, you should reverse the coat hanger when you wear something, so that by Christmas, you will be able to see everything you haven’t worn for a year and chuck it out. It would be good to do the same with membrillo or tahini. I would appreciate a smart, domineering fridge that enforced some kind of discipline on all pickled and jarred goods.At the end of each vegetable’s season, I would like an alert to that effect: your samphire days are numbered fine words butter no parsnips, but also, have YOU buttered no parsnips? Etc. If you only find out at the beginning of beetroot season, you heap up good intentions but have no real sense of urgency. I want to know when I’m in last-chance saloon. Indeed, last-chance saloon is my second favourite place, after regular saloon.Risotto: every time I make one, I think, I could happily eat this every day, if only I could think of something other than peas to put in it. A daily risotto recipe just pinging into some feed or other would be like a meditation tape or a breathing exercise – maybe just a theory, maybe you would never make it and it would be no more than an aspirational push-point for the better you, but, on the other hand, I bet you would e down some interesting wormholes involving lemons and aubergines.Finally, some kind of longitudinal, quantitative tracker, for all the resolutions made every January, that dropped off midway or made no difference except to ruin an already punishing season, might be socially worthwhile but I know this is the wrong time to bring that up. I’ll invent that in February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db322501986a0a7c475b210f8d01a5c21b56a36a/0_86_4715_2829/master/4715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9f0d7ba10cd3aa141b218cf9858e853","title":"fa talks ending exclusive cup deals betting companies","story":"The seven UK betting companies with exclusive rights to screen FA Cup matches have offered to cancel the exclusivity and allow the Football Association to show games itself following sustained criticism.The move comes after the FA opened talks over withdrawing from the controversial arrangement. It held discussions with IMG, the marketing giant that bought the Cup rights then struck deals with seven UK betting companies: Bet365, Betfair, William Hill, Coral, Ladbrokes, Unibet and Paddy Power.In a statement on behalf of the companies Brigid Simmonds, the chairman of the Betting and Gaming Council, said: “Our members did not seek exclusivity for the rights to screen FA cup games. They are therefore happy for IMG to offer the rights to screen these games to the Football Association or another appropriate body so that the games can be viewed for free by the public with immediate effect.”Given the FA’s stance on not accepting any sponsorships from betting sites, it had explored withdrawing from the deals – which were agreed in early 2017 before that decision was taken – amid a storm of protest.From the 2021-22 season, the FA had said its new broadcasting deal allowed it to show FA Cup matches on its own website to a UK audience, so the UK betting companies would no longer have the matches exclusively anyway.Ministers had earlier warned the FA its government funding could be cut unless it ditched the deal that allows gambling companies to show live Cup games on their websites to people who open accounts or place a bet, although that was considered very unlikely because government money paid via Sport England supports coaching and grassroots participation.MPs from all parties lined up on Thursday to condemn the FA’s commercial tie-up after an urgent question tabled by the Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who branded the deal “shameful”.“I’ve been very clear that the government has asked the FA to look at all avenues to review this element of their broadcasting agreement,” said Nigel Adams, a junior minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. He said he had summoned the FA for a meeting next week and would “see what opportunities there are to rescind this part of the deal”.The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith repeated his call, made in Thursday’s , for the government to review the funding it provides to the FA unless football’s governing body scraps the deal. “That will very much be on my agenda,” said Adams.Audience numbers for the third-round matches shown on gambling websites are not publicly available as only the betting companies have the data, but they are thought to be relatively small, given the games are those not picked by broadcasters for a wider audience, and not kicking off at 3pm.MPs lined up to express concern about gambling’s hold on football and to criticise the FA for signing a deal that allowed betting companies to show 32 FA Cup games, compared with two on free-to-air TV.The discussion saw widespread support from all parties for reform of the Gambling Act passed in 2005 under Tony Blair’s Labour government, which liberalised regulation on the industry.The Conservative manifesto committed the government to a review of what it called “analogue legislation in a digital age” and Labour has also called for the act to be replaced.GamCare (gamcare.org.uk, helpline: 0808 8020 133) offers free information, support and counselling for problem gamblers in the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba191bef09ddd5bdbe60ff2f2fd9ca30a7c89b5c/0_0_2996_1797/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0f6640fdc415ee86a8f5e87c58cfa3b","title":"nick cushing leaves manchester city women to join new york city fc","story":"Nick Cushing has left his role as manager of Manchester City Women to take up an assistant coach role with MLS side New York City FC, part of the City Football Group.His final game in charge will be City’s game against title rivals Arsenal on 2 February before he heads off to work alongside New York City’s newly-appointed head coach Ronny Deila.The assistant manager, Alan Mahon, will take charge of the women’s team in the interim, with former England men’s Under-21 coach Brian Eastick supporting him.“Making the decision to leave MCWFC has been incredibly difficult given the fantastic players and staff that we have here and the incredible success that we have achieved together – it isn’t one that I have taken lightly,” Cushing told the Manchester City website.“We’ve had an amazing six-and-a-half seasons and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with everybody – I will be extremely emotional to leave, but I’m very excited for my next role within the City Football Group.

However, lenders would then have to offer a single rate for all easy-access cash savings accounts after 12 months. That rate would be openly published twice a year.The rules, which will now go out for consultation, are meant to increase transparency and competition across the easy-access savings market, which has been accused of taking advantage of customer inertia.“Competition is not working well for many of the 40 million consumers with easy-access savings accounts and we want that to change,” said Christopher Woolard, the FCA’s executive director of strategy and competition.“This will prevent firms from gradually reducing interest rates over time and make them compete for all their customers. We are concerned that many longstanding customers are seeing a poor outcome and we want firms to focus more on these customers,” Woolard added. “The new rate will also make it easier for savers to know whether they are getting a good deal after any introductory offer has expired.”The move is expected to force banks to increase historically low interest rates in order to retain longstanding customers after their rates become public.The FCA has estimated that savers will be handed an extra £260m a year in higher interest payments as a result. While some of the most attractive interest rates may drop “very slightly”, the regulator believes rates for the least competitive end of the market – primarily longstanding customers – will increase overall.Laura Suter, a personal finance analyst for investment platform AJ Bell, said the regulator’s plans would mark a dramatic change in the cash savings market. “It will mean banks can’t hide behind a vast array of different interest rates for cash accounts, depending on how long ago you opened the account, whether it’s run online or in branch and what branding the account has been given.”But the bank lobby group UK Finance warned that the the move could result in higher interest rates for borrowers and mortgage customers.It also claimed the industry had already taken steps to increase competition, such as communicating more clearly with customers about their rates, including before they are reduced.Eric Leenders, a managing director at UK Finance, said: “Banking business depends on there being an adequate margin between what a provider pays for its deposit funding and what it charges for the loans it makes available.“Regulatory intervention that increases the overall cost of deposit funding for providers will, in general, result in providers having to raise the cost of loans they make available to house purchasers and other borrowers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df99b78331d335571ecc45028a1d714383a93283/407_0_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84fbae303554d9e83cbbbc4355edd530","title":"all aboard australias elvis express in pictures","story":"The Parkes Elvis festival is held every year in the second week in January in New South Wales.

However, the influential union boss went on to dismiss this on Twitter on Wednesday evening as “utter nonsense” and “fake news”.Gardiner told the  McCluskey had not asked him to run. Unite will only make a decision after the union’s executive committee meeting ends on 24 January.Gardiner, the MP for Brent North, has held his seat since 1997 and was a junior minister under Tony Blair.His reluctance to back a second EU referendum and belief that Labour should go along with the 2016 result has put him at odds with some in the shadow cabinet pushing for a more remain stance, including Starmer.He was caught mocking the shadow Brexit secretary’s six tests for a deal they could support, including the test that the government would need to prove that it could achieve the “exact same benefits” as EU membership after quitting the bloc.Gardiner was recorded saying it was “bollocks” and has also warned that a second referendum could lead to civil disobedience.His announcement on Wednesday night took rival camps by surprise, with one campaign staffer describing the news as “coming from absolutely nowhere”.Starmer currently has nominations from 24 MPs, while Rebecca Long Bailey has seven. Jess Phillips has six MP nominations, Lisa Nandy has two and Emily Thornberry has one. Clive Lewis, who was among the first to declare, has not yet received an official nomination.The contest will end on 2 April, with the winner announced two days later.Former Jeremy Corbyn staffers and allies have taken on key jobs on various leadership campaigns. Starmer has signed up Corbyn’s former chief of staff, Simon Fletcher, to be his principal strategic adviser.Momentum cofounder and chair Jon Lansman is Long Bailey’s campaign director. Former Corbyn spokesman Matt Zarb-Cousin will become her head of communications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f5db135f201a1ea49c24b34d9597cae26cb45a5/333_11_1971_1183/master/1971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4442c2649a555f4fb533e6f54d460db","title":"labour leadership clive lewis backs federalism and says scottish labour should be fully independent live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThe troubled Northern rail franchise faces financial collapse within months, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said, as the government set out a timetable to tackle the “unacceptable services” for rail passengers in the north. My colleague Gwyn Topham has the full story here.Nadia Whittome, the new Labour MP for Nottingham East, also says she is going to nominate Clive Lewis for Labour leader without necessarily planning to vote for him because she wants his ideas to be part of the debate. Lloyd Russell-Moyle is in this position too. (See 1.55pm.)In Edinburgh, first minister’s questions – briefly interrupted by Extinction Rebellion climate protesters – were dominated by a domestic agenda today, but not without the usual thread of constitutional matters. The interim Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw’s attack on Nicola Sturgeon’s education record probably has to be seen in the context of his current bid for party leadership to replace Ruth Davidson, as he promised that 2020 would be the year of holding the SNP government to account.Likewise, the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, mounted a dissection of social care services, arguing that the failing integration of health and social care services alongside council funding cuts were the direct responsibility of the Scottish government.As usual, Westminster was not far away: Sturgeon responded that her government was working to protect heath and social care within a very constrained overall budget, the ultimate result of Westminster austerity. Similarly, she rebuffed attempts to criticise the SNP’s record by repeating that the public had given their verdict in last month’s election. One might argue this is not necessarily a direct conclusion of the SNP’s general election success, given that a Westminster campaign does not scrutinise their performance in Holyrood.But when Brexit was mentioned directly, with a question about Wednesday’s decisive Holyrood vote to reject Boris Johnson’s withdrawal agreement, Sturgeon repeated what is now an entirely familiar call for Scotland to have the opportunity to decide its own future. While yesterday’s vote was entirely symbolic – Holyrood can’t bind the Westminster parliament in this way – it does add to the growing narrative of Scotland as entirely ergent politically from the rest of the UK.Here is the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush on Barry Gardiner’s possible run for the Labour leadership. (See 1.26pm.)Emily Thornberry has picked up another nomination. This is from the Labour MP and former minister Gareth Thomas.Earlier I said that there was no evidence in this contest of Labour MPs nominating someone for the leadership even though they did not want them to become leader. (See 9.38am.) Some MPs nominated Jeremy Corbyn on this basis in 2015, and were horrified when he actually won.Not for the first time, I spoke to soon. On the BBC’s Daily Politics Lloyd Russell-Moyle said that, although he was backing Rebecca Long Bailey for the leadership, he was considering nominating Clive Lewis because he thought that Lewis’s ideas for constitutional reform should be included in the debate.Hannah Bardell, an SNP MP who was who was called “queer” by a peer after she raised his “abusive” behaviour towards parliamentary staff, is set to report him to the police for an alleged hate crime, HuffPost’s Arj Singh reports. Bardell was speaking in the Commons during business questions this morning. Here is an extract from Singh’s story.Lord Ken Maginnis was accused of ‘one of the worst cases of abuse of security staff I have seen’ by SNP MP Hannah Bardell.The Northern Irish Ulster Unionist peer launched a tirade at staff, calling them “crooked” after he forgot his pass to enter parliament and they would not allow him in, Bardell told the Commons on Wednesday.Responding to HuffPost UK, Maginnis did not deny the allegations, instead choosing to attack Bardell by accusing her of attempting to to “settle a score” because she is “queer” and he is opposed to gay marriage.Bardell will now ask the police to look into both the incident at the Palace of Westminster’s underground entrance, and his subsequent comments attacking her ...Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said Maginnis’s “attack” on Bardell was “unutterably disgraceful”. He told MPs Bardell was “clearly owed an apology” from the peer.Journalists last night were taken aback by the news that Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, was considering entering the Labour leadership contest because it sounded most improbable. Gardiner has not been campaigning, candidates only have until 2.30pm on Monday to get the 22 nominations they need from MPs or MEPs to stay in the contest, around half of MPs have already nominated someone, and Gardiner himself is in Abu Dhabi at a climate crisis event, which is not the best place to be if you need to win over almost two dozen MPs. But he is considering standing, as he told my colleague Kate Proctor. Here is her story.This morning Gardiner gave another interview about his possible candidature to the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire. He was speaking from Abu Dhabi, apparently via Skype. Here are the main points.If I know that I can secure the 22 votes necessary in order to go forward to the next stage, then I will stand. But until I have that assurance from my colleagues then I’m not going to go further than considering it just at the moment.Len, if you are watching, I would be very pleased to get a phone call from you. I would like to talk through with you how we can improve employment rights in this country, how we can have safer standards at work, and all the things that we are about ... And I would, of course, love to have your support.This is odd because, according to McCluskey, Gardiner did get a call from the Unite leader last night.I can win a general election.Asked if he was saying the other candidates could not, he went on:I’m setting out what I believe is the key reason why colleagues, many of whom have spoken to me and encouraged me to stand, have said to me.They believe I have the ability to communicate, to bring that dynamism of debate, that is necessary in order to go out to the country.McCluskey says he has not urged Gardiner to run, but Skwawkbox, a pro-Corbyn website supported by Unite and seen by some as a mouthpiece for the union, has over the last two days run articles promoting Gardiner as a candidate. Skwawkbox also ran various articles pushing Ian Lavery as a leadership candidate until he announced that he would not be standing. These blogposts fuelled the theory that some Corbynites were either unhappy with Rebecca Long Bailey as a candidate, or doubtful about whether she could win, and were looking around for someone else to champion Corbynism in the contest.Jack McConnell, the former Labour Scottish first minister, is backing Lisa Nandy for Labour leader, the Scotsman’s Paris Gourtsoyannis reports.The Labour leadership candidate Jess Phillips has posted this response on Twitter to Clive Lewis’s article in the Nation saying Scottish Labour should be free to back independence. (See 9.18am.)The Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry has been speaking to Sky News and she has been giving her own marks for Jeremy Corbyn on a scale from 0 to 10. Rebecca Long Bailey, of course, said on Tuesday that Corbyn deserves 10 out of 10 as a leader. Thornberry’s assessment is less generous. She told Sky: I remain convinced that Jeremy is not antisemitic. But I think that clearly we completely failed when it came to dealing with antisemitism in the party, and that was a failure of leadership. And Jeremy knows my views on this. And I’m afraid I would not give him more than 2 out of 10 in relation to that.But when it comes to principle, bringing people into the party, firing up the party, bringing us back to speaking from our hearts, I would give him 10 out of 10.Losing an election is probably the most important thing by which you would measure a leader, and obviously we lost very, very badly. And on that basis, I would give him on that nought out of 10. What else could I do?This is from Sky’s Mollie Malone.Downing Street has now issued a fuller read-out of the PM’s conversation with the Iranian president.

Daniel Robson explores how the future is closer than we think The concept reads like the set-design notes for a Star Trek movie: home furnishings that change colour and shape according to your mood, modular rooms that can be added to your home, and bathrooms that can track your health statistics. But the era of the smart eco-home may actually be closer than you think.Futurologists and energy experts say that by 2030, we could be able to use existing reconfigurable materials and augmented reality to change the shape of our furniture, for example changing a brown leather sofa into a plush red velvet one, simply by commanding our in-home AI system. Smart cushions will change colour like chameleons to suit your mood. Bed covers will adapt to your body temperature for maximum snuggling.Innovations are afoot in the kitchen, too. Hydroponic gardens are already a reality, used in a growing number of restaurants around the world and even in branches of Veggie Pret – but by 2030 we may have these at home. Hydroponics uses LED lights to grow vegetables without soil in a compact space, and to keep them fresh for longer. And smart appliances such as kettles and toasters will store energy during off-peak times, so that they are cheaper to use when you actually need them. For now, though, we have smart meters and not only are they making us more energy efficient, they are going to be a main player in reaching the UK’s 2050 emissions target.Meanwhile, smart bathrooms may help to improve efficiency by generating power from toilet and shower wastewater, or even filtering it to make the home water self-sufficient.Buildings will be made from recycled materials, with improved insulation and solar panels on the rooftops and even in the windows. Modular rooms can be added as your family grows and then removed again when the kids leave home, allowing a more controlled usage of the energy supply. Sensors could track residents around the house, adjusting the temperature and lighting in each room accordingly.At the heart of this system are smart meters. Already available at no additional cost across Britain from your energy supplier, these gadgets monitor household energy use throughout the day and report data back to network operators, which helps to predict demand and generate the supply accordingly. They also tell users when electricity rates are cheapest, for more cost-efficient use.“A smart energy system makes it easier for us to draw on and store electricity when it’s less in demand, and then use it again when scarce or more expensive later in the day,” says Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs, Smart Energy GB. “Together, smart meters and a smart energy system help to create a cleaner, greener Britain.”There are already 15.6m smart meters installed in homes and businesses across Britain, and these devices not only make efficient energy use easy through visibility of consumption, they also display your near-real time costs in pounds and pence so that you can keep in better control of your spending.Stepping further into sci-fi utopia, smart meters can help to unlock the possibility of a shared electricity system for each local community, taking advantage of shared renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind farms, and powering things like a communal electric car pool as a convenient yet eco-friendly alternative to public transport.Electric car ownership is likely to rise anyway, as new government legislation will soon make it compulsory for all new-build homes with a dedicated parking space to include a charging point. With the help of a smart meter and a smart charger, cars will charge during off-peak hours, reducing the cost of fuel to as little as 3p per mile – compared with 11p for petrol and diesel cars.“There might even be instances where you could get paid to charge your car when the power system needs us to use more power,” said futurologist Dr Ian Pearson, during a panel discussion hosted by Smart Energy GB.With fossil fuels, it is easy for the energy companies to control the supply – when more power is needed, they just burn more coal. But renewable energy does not work this way: sun and wind power dictate their own routines.The best part is, you won’t even have to think about it. Once the system is set up, the smart meter, alongside your smart appliances, chargers and services will do all the work, managing your supply automatically according to your preferences. And the addition of batteries will make it possible to store power in the home.Saving energy, saving money, saving the environment. Smart eco-homes (and the smart meters that enable them) will become an integral part of a greener Britain – and the future could be with us in less than a decade.Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c1b4657ba7312bd0e8d362a78ac39d9426539a/0_182_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5ec0d8b58a897edb1fd389ca058787","title":"my house would only let good people in how kids see their homes of the future","story":"From houses that speak to you to magnifying glasses on the roof for energy, we take a glimpse into the future through the eyes of our youngest generation Fynn Rodell, 11: ‘The sun will heat my oven’I’m going to have loads of tech on my house to make it carbon neutral. I’ll have a wind turbine on the roof to generate electricity for lighting. There will be solar panels on the front door for more energy, and a magnifying glass on the roof to focus the sun’s heat for my oven. A vent will help suck the heat in and spread it around the house for extra heating when I’m not cooking. There will be a smart meter in the house to see how much energy I’m creating and how much I’m using.I’ll grow plants on the roof for insulation, to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and for insects to live there.The turbine on the roof will also power a water cleanser, so I can turn rainwater into drinking and washing water. I’ll have a toilet vacuum like on an airplane so that I don’t waste much water.Rosabela O’Selle-Goncalves, seven: ‘My house will say good things to you if you help the environment’In my house of the future the door should be brown, the house should be peach, and the roof should be red. There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it. To get water you don’t turn a tap on, you press a button and tell it how much water you want. When I walk in the lights will go on and if I leave they go off.Indy Williams, six: ‘Animals that have lost their habitats can come and live with us’In the future, my house will have solar panels on the roof to generate electricity for the TV, maybe a wind turbine too. We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds. I’ll put bird boxes on the roof so they have somewhere to live.The balcony will shelter the outdoor animals when it rains.

The Dutchman’s decision to re-sign with Red Bull until the end of 2023 is a commitment of confidence in the future of the team that brought him into Formula One. He clearly believes they can deliver a title-challenging car and in a month marked by attempts to be abstemious, Verstappen’s signature is just the stiffener Red Bull and their engine supplier Honda required.Verstappen will enter his sixth season in F1 when racing begins in Melbourne on 15 March. Only 22, he carries himself like a seasoned old hand on the grid. The past two years have demonstrated how consideration, maturity and judgment have all informed his natural talent. With every race he has been moving towards becoming a more complete driver.Throughout, Verstappen has remained assuredly confident in his own ability, even when on the receiving end of criticism for mistakes. It is a necessary trait for a driver, as he acknowledged before the opening of last season as he considered whether he could beat Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel in a straight fight. “It would be better to stay home if you don’t believe you can do it,” he said. “Of course it sounds arrogant to think like that but it would be stupid not to.”Unfortunately when Hamilton’s Mercedes proved all too strong from the off and Red Bull failed to really challenge until mid-season, that three-way battle was denied. Verstappen’s decision to stick with Red Bull mouthwateringly suggests we may yet see it this season or after the regulation changes in 2021.Red Bull took Verstappen on in their junior program in 2014. He was placed at Toro Rosso in 2015 and was promoted to the senior squad a year later. He has been explicit in his gratitude to the team and in a genuine desire to win the title with them. Last year was almost their most successful of the turbo‑hybrid era. Verstappen was fastest in qualifying three times, took three race wins and finished third – ahead of both Ferrari drivers – in the championship.Hamilton has said that in 2012, as he considered the move from McLaren to Mercedes, he was persuaded not only by Niki Lauda but by Ross Brawn outlining the plans the team had and the steps they would take. Verstappen has surely been shown a similarly confident road map for Red Bull‑Honda.With stable regulations they expect only to move forward in 2020. Indeed Red Bull’s motor sport adviser Helmut Marko has already been bullish about their chances. “For the first time, we are 14 days ahead of our normal schedule,” he said in December. “We’re going into the new year better than ever and with a great concept. Now we finally have to deliver.”Verstappen echoed the good vibes. “We hope to be able to compete for the world championship straight from the beginning of the season. I want to win with Red Bull.”Red Bull in turn know they needed Verstappen. At the sharp end, the drivers’ market is hanging according to whether Hamilton stays with Mercedes or switches to Ferrari for 2021. If he opted for the latter mid-season, Verstappen would have been an obvious target for Mercedes. Instead Red Bull have their No 1 locked down and can focus on the task at hand. Ferrari have done similarly with Charles Leclerc but they and Mercedes are still dependent on which way Hamilton and in turn Vettel jump.For Honda, too, Verstappen is a major asset. After their travails with McLaren, their first year with Red Bull has been hugely positive. They endured no mechanical failures with Red Bull and increasingly closed the gap to Mercedes and Ferrari. Verstappen claimed their first win in 13 years at the Austrian Grand Prix and notably pointed at the Honda badge on his overalls on the podium.Honda only recently committed to stay in F1 until the end of 2021. Verstappen may be the driver who keeps them in the sport for the long term. Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, has noted the close level of engagement Verstappen has with Honda and Honda’s F1 managing director, Masashi Yamamoto, and compared their relationship to the one they enjoyed with Ayrton Senna between 1987 and 1992. “We see him as a very important factor with Honda’s project,” he said. “He’s young, but his driving is really impressive. It looks like seeing a young Senna, with his relationship with Honda.”Verstappen reciprocated, noting Honda’s attention to detail was paying idends. “This year, we’ve never retired because of a Honda issue,” he said at the end of the season. “If you want to fight for a world championship, that is what you need. I am very, very impressed with the way they are working.”His decision suggests these are not idle claims or desires. These are the sounds of every element of the team moving collectively in the right direction. Horner believes Red Bull can be challengers and Verstappen has nailed his colours to that mast. He, Red Bull, Honda and hopefully fans of a truly competitive F1 will all reap the benefits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c3250a46998d3ba96f6881dd6b26b9841dfb2fe/0_98_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83cd1e4548a5daf701ac14a90581692e","title":"facebook political ads micro targeting us election","story":"Facebook has decided not to limit how political ads can be targeted to specific groups of people, as its main digital-ad rival Google did in November to fight misinformation.Neither will it ban political ads outright, as Twitter did last October. And it still will not factcheck them, as it’s faced pressure to do.Instead, it is announcing much more limited “transparency features” that aim to give users slightly more control over how many political ads they see and to make its online library of political ads easier to use.These steps appear unlikely to assuage critics – including some of the company’s rank-and-file employees – who say Facebook has too much power and not enough limits when it comes to its effects on elections and democracy itself.Since last fall, Facebook has insisted that it won’t factcheck political ads, a move that critics say gives politicians license to lie in ads that cannot be easily monitored by outsiders. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly argued that “political speech is important” and that Facebook doesn’t want to interfere with it.Google, the digital ads leader, is limiting political-ad targeting to broad categories such as sex, age and postal code.Facebook said in a blogpost on Thursday that it considered limiting the targeting of political ads. But the social network said it learned about their importance for “reaching key audiences” after conducting outreach with political campaigns from both US parties, political groups and nonprofits.The company said it was guided by the principle that “people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public”.Facebook does plan to let users choose to see “fewer” political and social-issue ads, although it will not let people exclude them entirely. It will also let people search the ad library for exact phrases and to limit their search results using filters such as ad-audience size, dates and regions reached.The transparency changes will go into effect over the next three months in the US and other countries where Facebook puts “paid for by” disclaimers on political ads. The political-ad controls won’t roll out in the US until early summer the company will “eventually” expand them to other regions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8ed8c4f360f6f05e5a7043e7bd84c5214a47da4/0_163_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=910c4523ab235df2c0bf9b6c224acc7c","title":"twitter introduce ability stop people replying tweets","story":"Measure is aimed at preventing antisocial behaviour and improving quality of discussionTwitter users will be able to prevent others from replying to their tweets, the company has announced, in a move it hopes will prevent antisocial behaviour on the platform while improving the quality of conversation for all.But the new features could undercut the social network’s ambition to prevent the spread of misinformation. It is unclear how Twitter intends to reconcile the two goals.In a press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Twitter’s director of product management, Suzanne Xie, said the company would be introducing a setting for “conversation participants” at some point this year. It will let tweeters choose from four options, on a per-tweet level:The company plans to begin experimenting with the features in the first quarter of 2020, with a goal to introducing them globally by the end of the year.“Getting ratioed, getting dunked on, the dynamics that happen that we think aren’t as healthy are definitely part of … our thinking about this,” Xie said, according to the Verge.The proposal could solve some of the problems that have given Twitter a reputation as a “toxic” platform. Being “ratioed” – a slang term for when a tweet receives more replies than likes or retweets – can be an unpleasant experience. Similarly, a conversation between friends can be interrupted by strangers, potentially turning a friendly chat into something more antagonistic.But it also appears to go against Twitter’s policies on misinformation. Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not have a fact-checking programme and it only bans narrow misinformation aimed at manipulating or interfering with elections. Instead, the company argues that “Twitter’s open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information”, as its then head of public policy, Colin Crowell, put it in 2017.“Journalists, experts and engaged citizens tweet side by side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds,” he said. “These vital interactions happen on Twitter every day, and we’re working to ensure we are surfacing the highest quality and most relevant content and context first.”The new features would instead allow purveyors of false information to simply mark their tweets as “statements”, preventing those “vital interactions” from occurring. A similar feature that allows users to hide replies to their tweets is already being used by scammers on the social network to remove replies that fact-check their lies.In response to such fears, Xie suggested that the ability to quote-tweet such misinformation may remain intact but acknowledged it was “something we’re going to be watching really closely as we experiment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8aa71d382641d0a5282719f5884f0a5904c4a61/395_111_4526_2717/master/4526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4511235d1246f88c63ebc34def9dde2","title":"how do i find a smartphone with the specifications i really want","story":"Product search tools help you find a phone, PC or camera if you know the specs you wantMy Samsung S8 has given up the ghost, and the prohibitive cost of repair means I’m in the market for a new mobile phone. I’ve come up with a wishlist of specifications. Are there any phones due in the coming months that offer all of these? I don’t believe anything currently on the market does. DeclanThere are four obvious problems with having a list of specifications for the device you want to buy, whether it’s a smartphone, tablet, laptop, digital camera or whatever. The first and biggest problem is that it can easily eliminate most of the products on the market or, in your case, all of them. In fact, it’s a problem I share: nobody offers a laptop that meets my most-desired specification, though a few come close.The second problem is that it can be hard work. There are thousands of products with variable specifications, many of them incomplete. The numbers you can find may well be a mixture of inches and centimetres, kilograms and pounds, and binary and decimal bytes. In some cases, I’ve created spreadsheets to compare products, partly to automate the format conversions.The third problem is that choosing purely on specification ignores other important features, such as manufacturing quality, ergonomics, software experience, reliability and support. That’s why it’s a good idea to get a “hands on” and to read independent reviews, plus the manufacturer’s support forums, if any.There’s always a risk factor, and some technology buyers are more risk-averse than others. Some are happy buying smartphones from little-known suppliers on Chinese websites others will prefer to buy from a local shop, so they can take it back when they run into a problem.The fourth problem is that most of us have personal preferences. Some people have historical reasons for choosing a particular brand – they’ve had good or bad experiences with other products from the same company – or they think it has more social credibility. Maybe they just like the colour or the way it looks. Buyers are often willing to compromise on specifications when less tangible aspects of desirability trigger an emotional response.I’m not saying that buying using specifications is wrong: people who ignore them risk buying stupid things. However, specs are not the whole story, and for many buyers, they are not even the main story. Either way, knowing what you value will help you make a more informed choice.From your wishlist of specifications, you want to buy a dual-sim Android 10 smartphone with at least 8GB of memory, 128GB or more storage (expandable), and a 90Hz or better display. This sort of spec should give you a decent range of options. Unfortunately, you also want a headphone jack, wireless charging and water resistance, which reduces the options to none. The last thing on your wishlist is 5G: “nice to have for future proofing not required”. That’s a nice thought, but “Android” and “future proofing” are mutually incompatible.I don’t know of any phones that exactly match your wishlist, and I think the long-term trend is the other way. I envisage future smartphones as completely sealed devices with no ports at all. Sims will be “virtual” esims (stored on the device, instead of physically inserted) and everything else will be done wirelessly.It only took a couple of minutes on GSM Arena’s Phone Finder to come up with what might be your best choice – the Xiaomi Redmi K30 – but you could also consider the Lenovo Z6 running Android 9. If you want a 5G phone, the only option is the Xiaomi Redmi K30 5G. You can compare all three here. They are all reasonably priced.On the whole, then, I think you should stick with Samsung, unless you have totally gone off the company, which would be understandable in the circumstances.GSM Arena is really useful if you’re buying a smartphone or a tablet – the two product categories it covers. If I’m buying something else, I’m often tempted to ask “what’s the GSM Arena of” cameras or laptops or TV sets or whatever. There is rarely a good answer, but for digital camera buyers, the Amazon-owned DP Review website is excellent.Like GSM Arena, DP Review lets you find cameras by their specifications and compare them side by side. I’ve used these features in earlier answers about digital photography.Laptop buyers could really do with their own GSM Arena, but I’ve never found one. However, the advanced search feature on the somewhat obscure noteb is worth a go. It has sliders to set maximum and minimum values for things like launch date, number of processor cores, power consumption, memory, storage, display size and vertical resolution, battery capacity, estimated battery life, and so on. You can ignore any fields you don’t care about. You can sort the results by value, price, performance or by name, and its rankings seem sensible. Alternatively, you can focus on a particular class of laptop – the options are Mainstream, Ultraportable, Business, Gaming and CAD3D modelling – or on a single brand. Clicking on a laptop brings up its full specification.This “laptop search engine” also has a blog and a YouTube channel. It looks like a labour of love. It solicits donations and has a Patreon page. One incentive is that donors can get personal laptop buying advice. I hope it survives. Maybe Jeff Bezos should buy it, because Amazon’s laptop search badly needs upgrading.There are, of course, plenty of useful websites such as Laptopmag, Notebookcheck and the Wirecutter. They all have good reviews and top product picks. However, when it comes to finding laptops that fit a choice of specs, I usually end up using the limited and often clunky filtering features on retail sites such as Currys PC World, eBuyer, Argos, Laptops Direct and so on. The obvious drawback is that they won’t find interesting products that they don’t stock. And those are the ones that someone hunting for a very particular spec may well want to buy.GSM Arena is a global website, so some phones may not work in the UK, or wherever you happen to live. There’s less of a risk now the UK has six different 4G bands between 800MHz (the old analogue TV band) and 2.6GHz, but if you’re buying a smartphone from overseas, it’s important to check. Phones sold within the UK should, of course, work with British networks.Have you got a question?

Are the bruises and breakages worth it?Simply watching Cheer, Netflix’s documentary series about cheerleading champions from Navarro college in Texas is like being in the marines. Seeing the dedication, resilience and innate talent of the athletes, many of whom come from profoundly troubled backgrounds and have seized upon the sport and the specialised college course as an almost literal lifeline, will break you down. (“What,” you will find yourself asking, “is there in my pathetic simulacrum of existence that can compare to this ennobling vision of humanity unspooling across six hour-long episodes before my sofa-spread, doughy form?” and no answer will come.)But then it will build you back up. “Look what the human body is capable of!” you will start to think, as 40 students made entirely of muscle and sinew bend, flip, form pyramids, toss and catch each other midair – and generally disapply all known laws of physics. They are as gods, and if you cannot hope to emulate, you will surely wish to serve.The members of the Navarro squad are competitive cheerleaders (distinct from football cheerleaders who dominate the public image of the activity), and its practitioners are somewhere between acrobats, dancers and weightlifters, while maintaining the stamina of long-distance runners. The series focuses, refreshingly, on the graft, not the glamour – which comes for a few fleeting minutes at the end of a year’s training when state teams converge on the national championship in Daytona to compress all their work into one routine around 200 seconds long. And although it registers friendships and fallings-out, it does not make them into soapy storylines. It prefers, equally refreshingly, to dig deep into the many qualities that must combine to make a single performer, and then how they must coalesce into one team.The multiple daily practices are relentless, the technical prowess required is daunting, and the singularity of vision amounts to monomania. Any illusions you ever had about cheerleading will shatter within minutes. Scales will fall from your eyes more quickly than a flyer from a shonky pyramid practice. Flyers are the smallest, lightest squad members – the most easily launched and caught in basket tosses, and the ones catapulted to the very top of any formation.Each episode fills in, without sensationalism or sentimentality, the backstories of various squad members. The gravity-defying tumbler Lexi, for example, was a teenage runaway. Flyer and tumbler Morgan became near suicidal through childhood neglect by her parents. Now, she competes alongside the others, despite having only a fraction of their training. By the end of it she has surpassed even the highest expectations. And the stunter (one of the rocks on which formations are built) and tumbler La’Darius has endured parental neglect, sexual abuse at his carer’s home and violence from his brothers who, horrified by his homosexuality but scared what it would mean for him, tried to “beat him into a man”. He survived a suicide attempt and now moves with impossible strength, skill and grace throughout the routine that we watch come together over the 68 days they have before Daytona.She holds them accountable for their actions – her rules about behaviour, social media, drug use and so on are ironclad – but her support is unwavering. She is a (self-described) conservative, churchgoing Texan, but in loco parentis to several gay teenagers (although only La’Darius describes himself as such on screen) and in an ongoing argument with her pastor about his attitudes. “I will debate you up one side and down the other if you talk about my boys,” she said. “I won’t be changed.”She has a more robust attitude than many mothers might to the injuries that befall her offspring, but she and her squad are in it to win it. If the price paid in hairline fractures, dislocated joints and deep tissue bruising seems too high to civilians – well, that’s why we remain civilians, spread out doughily on our sofas while we watch others soar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

It is one of a number of disputes that is threatening to overshadow the anniversary events later this month.On 27 January, more than 100 Auschwitz survivors will travel to southern Poland for a day of commemorations at the site of the sprawling network of extermination and concentration camps, on the anniversary of the date in 1945 that Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. It is the last significant anniversary at which a large number of survivors are expected to be alive and well enough to attend.Four days earlier, an event titled Remembering the Holocaust: Fighting Antisemitism is planned at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial on the western slope of Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. More than 45 heads of state and world leaders are set to fly in for the ceremony, which will include orchestra performances and Jewish mourning prayers. The organisers hope it will lead to a firm plan of action to combat rising antisemitism and Holocaust denial.Instead, the buildup to the event has been hit by controversy.“It turns out that the presidents of Russia, Germany and France – whose government collaborated with Nazi Germany at the time – will speak, but the organisers do not agree to a speech by the president of Poland,” Andrzej Duda said in a television interview on Sunday. “I absolutely do not agree to this.” On Tuesday, his office announced he would not take part.Błażej Spychalski, a spokesman for Duda, told Polish news outlets that “a situation in which the president of Poland will sit and listen to the false words of President Putin without being able to reply is unacceptable”.The Russian government has recently launched a campaign to whitewash the Soviet Union’s 1939 non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany and subsequent invasion of Poland, and instead claims Poland was partly responsible for starting the second world war.In a statement, Yad Vashem said it had never received an official Polish request for President Duda to speak, a claim denied by Marek Magierowski, Poland’s ambassador to Israel, who said that both Yad Vashem and the Israeli authorities had known about “the conditions for the participation of President Duda” for at least four months.Yad Vashem also rebutted comments from Duda that he should speak because Poland was the country that had the most citizens murdered at Auschwitz.“It is important to note, that out of 1.1 million victims of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, some 1 million were Jews who were murdered simply because they were Jewish, unrelated to the countries of origin. Hence, the nationalities of the victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau have no bearing on the identity of leaders who will address the Fifth World Holocaust Forum,” said the statement.Relations between Poland and Israel have been strained in recent years, with accusations that the nationalist government in Warsaw wants to play down instances of Polish collaboration in the Holocaust.Last February, the acting Israeli foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, said that “Poles suckle antisemitism with their mothers’ milk”. In response, the Polish prime minister, , accused him of racism and pulled out of a planned summit in Jerusalem.Daniel Blatman, who teaches Holocaust studies at the University of Jerusalem and is chief historian at a new museum of the Warsaw ghetto in Poland, said he understood Duda’s decision to pull out of the event.“I can understand that a representative of Russia should speak at the anniversary, since it was the Red Army which liberated the camp. But why should the president of France speak, when the French government deported 30,000 Jews to Auschwitz, but not the president of Poland?”As well as the international disputes, concern has also been raised about how the event will play inside Israel, where a new election to break political deadlock is due in March.While the country’s president, Reuven Rivlin, and prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will address the forum, the head of the opposition, Benny Gantz, had a request to speak denied.Israeli media reported that Gantz’s party, which is hoping to topple the prime minister’s ruling Likud party in the March election, was concerned Netanyahu would use the podium to promote his political agenda."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e70f0c054037f859b5e0c6f7074607185240b6/907_81_3377_2026/master/3377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7dc72c59376de6886607a935aa4739","title":"uk accused of behaving like cowboys over eu database copying","story":"Dutch Liberal MEP Sophie in ’t Veld says leaked report revealed ‘violations and abuse’The British government has been accused of “behaving like a bunch of cowboys” after a confidential report revealed it had allowed illegal copying of an EU database.The issue, discussed publicly for the first time on Thursday, threatens to sour talks on the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU, despite hopes on both sides for close ties in fighting crime and terrorism.Sophie in ’t Veld, a Dutch liberal MEP, told the European parliament’s justice and home affairs committee that a leaked EU report revealed “deliberate violations and abuse” by the UK of the Schengen Information System, a vast database used by police and border guards across the EU’s border-free Schengen zone.While the UK is not a member of the border-free travel area, it has negotiated access to the database, where authorities across Europe share more than 76m items of information on criminal suspects, missing people or contraband goods.“This is a country that is not a member of Schengen because it doesn’t want to be a member of Schengen,” In ’t Veld told MEPs. “It doesn’t want to be a member of the European Union. Nevertheless, in the kindness of our hearts we have given them access to the Schengen Information System and they behaved like a bunch of cowboys.”The MEP, who has tabled a complaint to the European commission, said “one of the most astonishing” features of the leaked report was “the lack of reciprocity” from British authorities to act in the interest of EU counterparts.The leaked EU report states that British border guards only act on alerts “the UK considers to be important”, meaning some checks on people and documents requested by other member states are not carried out. Another charge is that the UK “does not always take action” if someone wanted for arrest is leaving the UK. British police, according to the report, are trained only to seize contraband goods relating to crimes committed on UK soil, not those in other EU member states.The document, first reported by the EUObserver website in 2018, is based on visits by EU inspectors to 22 sites, including politan police HQ, Heathrow airport and the Folkestone checkpoint. Nine of the total were surprise visits to police units across the UK, as well as British Transport police.Following those visits in November 2017, the EU concluded that British authorities had made “unlawful” full or partial copies of the SIS database. The report said “major deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS” in the UK that had not been remedied, despite concerns first raised in 2015. The litany of problems pose “serious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data”.An official responsible for information systems, borders and security at the European commission’s Home Directorate, Marc Sulon, told MEPs that an evaluation on how to respond to the report’s findings was put “temporarily on hold in October 2018” because of Brexit negotiations and no-deal planning.EU member states, he said, had decided in June 2018 not to disconnect the UK from the database but give British authorities “the opportunity to propose a plan for remedial action”. The commission’s evaluation had resumed as the UK would remain part of the database until at least the end of 2020 under the Brexit transition period.Sulon dismissed claims that the US government had access to the EU database via the UK’s illegal copies. US companies working for the UK government are suspected to have made the copies, but Sulon said the rules allowed “cooperation with contractors … subject to compliance with all provisions of the legislation”.MEPs reacted with fury to the commission’s handling of the affair, including a missed deadline to respond to a European parliament question raising the alarm.

Paul Reid said it would be a policy decision for Government but he believes numbers need to be “really assessed.”Mr Reid was speaking on Thursday towards the worst ever week of overcrowding in the Irish hospital system. There were 520 patients waiting for admission to hospital on Thursday morning, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO).This is 4 per cent up on the same day last year but down from the record high of 760 set last Monday and Tuesday.“This is still a dangerous number of patients without beds, but any progress is welcome,” said INMO General Secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha. “We must keep a laser focus on driving this figure down in the coming days. The only acceptable figure for patients without beds is zero.”Because of the overcrowding, large sections of hospitals have effectively shut down and some emergency departments can no longer accommodate trolleys, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) has claimed. As a result, patient safety was being compromised.But Mr Reid, speaking on Newstalk, said progress was being made in reducing the number of people on trolleys in hospitals. The health system traditionally sees intense pressure on services at the start of the year during the winter flu season.Health officials have directed that elective surgeries be cancelled, and Minister for Health Simon Harris has promised extra hospital beds in an attempt to ease the strain on emergency departments.Mr Reid said there was a need to strengthen community care to provide some relief to hospitals.“If we keep doing everything the same as we’ve been doing it, we’ll continue to have the same answer and have an overcrowding issue.”He called for three measures to be implemented. “The first one I’d call improving the capacity that we have in the system - the number of beds and resources to support those beds.“We need about 2,500 beds in the hospital system over a period of years.“We also need to resource up and strengthen our capacity in the community side to give relief on to the acute hospital system.“That’s a major part of our national service plan next year.“More GPs, more diagnostics in our primary care centres, more capacity and capability of pharmacies to look at minor injuries, etc. There’s a way of changing the route into the acute system.”The second element is changing the way that the HSE organises its work between the acute system and the community system, he added.“The third one is we do really need to look at the number of emergency departments that we’re managing all across the system.“So we’re currently managing 29 emergency departments, and that’s the route where primarily people go when they need it.“There’s a lot we need to do with our current emergency departments, but it has to be part of an assessment we do.“Just to give a simple example, in a national trauma strategy where we’re looking at people who would be treated in major traumas. That does have a vision of having a small number of dedicated, major trauma centres across the country with a number of spines and hubs through the country off that,” he said.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThree years after the collapse of Stormont, the British and Irish governments were on Thursday afternoon still trying to resolve outstanding difficulties to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly.The Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the Northern Secretary Julian Smith were seeking to conclude a text to restore the powersharing institutions that could be published later on Thursday.They believed that they had a document that would constitute a “fair and balanced” agreement but late on Wednesday and into Thursday morning they were unable to sort out final difficulties with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin.Sources said that most of the text of the document was settled but that there were “presentational problems” that in particular were causing anxiety for the DUP.“I think it is a matter of presentation rather than substance I don’t think there is any sense that things are beginning to fall apart,” said one well placed source. Equally, some other sources expressed concern that Mr Coveney and Mr Smith were now under pressure to put back Monday’s deadline for a deal. Mr Smith has stated he will call Assembly elections if there is no agreement by Monday.One DUP source downplayed the prospect of a breakthrough on Thursday. “The parties have a lot of work to get through,” he said, although Dublin and London are still seeking to get a deal on Thursday.Three years ago on this date, the late Martin McGuinness resigned as Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister in a row with the DUP over the calamitous renewable heat incentive scheme, a resignation that precipitated the breakdown of Stormont.There have been several attempts since then to reinstate Stormont but hurdles such as Sinn Féin’s demand for an Irish language act, ensuring the sustainability of a restored Assembly, and issues over the petition of concern, could not be surmounted.However, all sides accept that significant progress was made on the remaining issues over recent months, including on the especially difficult matter of the Irish language.It is understood that the text would include Irish language legislation but that it would be embraced in wider legislation addressing matters such as Ulster Scots and identity under some form of overarching “cultural” legislation.A number of DUP sources said that persuading its constituency to acquiesce to Irish language legislation will prove difficult for the party.One DUP source said the party was seeking a quid pro quo for acceding to Irish language legislation from Sinn Féin. In particular he said that while Sinn Féin wanted concessions to its cultural identity there was no reciprocation from Sinn Féin.“There is a lot of talk about a shared future but Sinn Féin is not prepared to recognise or respect our British identity,” he said.The source added the DUP was seeking to have the British Armed Forces Covenant, which applies in Britain but not in Northern Ireland, implemented in the North. The covenant provides health, education and housing support for former British soldiers and their families.The source said that while Sinn Féin was amenable to the covenant operating in Northern Ireland it wasn’t prepared to have the necessary legislation enacted at Stormont, but to maintain distance wanted it introduced through Westminster.“That hardly shows any commitment to a shared future, and hardly augurs well for any new Executive. These are big issues for us - the failure of nationalism to recognise our British identity,” said the source. At lunchtime however the Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said her party was committed to “new style politics, to progressive politics”.“Our determination is to make politics work. It is going to take all of the parties to make politics work. It is going to need to be sustainable and credible government, a government that actually has equality at its core. That is out determination, we are here to do the business,” she added.Ulster Unionist Party Assembly member Mike Nesbitt said it was time for a deal. “We need the DUP and Sinn Féin to show leadership by making a decision today,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4134729.1578583981!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 varadkar believes government can continue without election date agreement with fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin (left) will meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Thursday to discuss the date of the general election.Mr Varadkar also indicated he will speak to smaller parties and groups in the Dáil to see if they will help him continue in office. However, he declined to answer on three occasions if the Dáil will reconvene next week after its Christmas recess. The Taoiseach said it was not a yes or no answer. There has been speculation that Mr Varadkar could seek a Dáil dissolution before next Wednesday, when it is due to return after the Christmas break. Minister for Health Simon Harris has said the timing of an election will be decided by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in consultation with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin who are meeting on Thursday evening. Speaking on his way into a Cabinet meeting in Marino, Dublin, Mr Harris also criticised Cork South West TD Michael Collins, whose rural Independent group has said it will table a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health.“I have no confidence in Deputy Michael Collins anyway so it probably won’t come as much of a surprise he wouldn’t have any in me,” Mr Harris said. “He’s spent most of his time in Dáil Éireann opposing measures I was trying to bring forward, most particularly in relation to women’s reproductive health. What is very clear is that the timing of this election will be decided by the Taoiseach in consultation with the leader of the Opposition.“Obviously those talks will get under way today. But one way or another we’re going to have an election in Ireland in the not too distant future and I’m looking forward to having an opportunity during that election of putting forward our vision for the health service and for the country as a whole.”The leader of the Rural Independent Group of TDs, Mattie McGrath, has said he supports colleague Mr Collins’s proposal for a motion of no confidence in Minister for Health Simon Harris. “I haven’t had confidence in Simon Harris in a long time,” he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke show.Mr Harris also criticised Fianna Fáil’s record in government. “If you look at all economic indicators in this country we’re going in the right direction. We’ve many challenges, every country has but in Leo Varadkar we have the right leader to steer the ship, get us through this phase of Brexit, the next phase of Brexit and there’s some crucial work going on with Simon Coveney as well in Northern Ireland today. So we have a busy programme of work to do and at some point in the not too distant future we’ll ask the people to renew that mandate.”Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin meet in Dublin on Thursday evening amid mounting speculation the general election will be held next month. The leaders will discuss the conclusion of the confidence-and-supply deal between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and the date of the next election. The deal struck in 2016 kept the minority Fine Gael-led Government in power as Fianna Fáil agreed to abstain in key Dáil votes. Speculation in Fine Gael is growing the Taoiseach may call a snap election for next month, with either February 7th or 14th widely mooted by TDs. Mr Varadkar, however, has largely kept his counsel in public and in private.In recent days, Mr Martin has said there is “no question” of his party voting for the Government as requested by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who has asked Mr Martin to support the Government in some Dáil votes if there is to be an agreed election date.However, Mr Martin told Newstalk he would not change his position that Fianna Fáil would only abstain rather than support the Government on certain votes. It sets up a confrontation between the pair at their meeting on Thursday night.“There is no question of Fianna Fáil taking that position, he knows that,” Mr Martin said, adding Mr Varadkar should seek the support of Independents or smaller parties if he needed to make up the numbers in the Dáil.MotionMr Collins said there will be an opportunity to put forward the motion at the end of January or in early February, he added. “I am hopeful that any self-respecting politician will support this motion. I think it would be carried.”Mr Collins said the Minister for Health had presided over a “major crisis in the health service” with elective surgeries being cancelled, record numbers on trolleys, a recruitment embargo, delayed discharges and the “highest ever” waiting lists.“Somebody must be accountable for all this.”Mr McGrath described discussions between Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin as “unseemly”, and he urged them to “throw in the towel”. Mr Collins, a Cork South-West TD, said he and Danny Healy-Rae had returned from Belfast earlier this week with the 51st group of patients from the southwest who had cataract surgery in Northern Ireland rather than remain on waiting lists. When asked if he was ready for a general election if the motion of no confidence was successful, Mr Collins said: “it is up to Leo if an election is needed or not. Simon Harris is not functioning as a Minister. If that means a general election then so be it.”The time of year was not an issue, he said, as preparations had already begun. “It’s already started. The sooner the better.” Ministers already have Vote Number 1 stickers on their cars, he said.The Cabinet meets in north Dublin on Thursday and will discuss disability issues. The venue – the Marino Institute of Higher Education – is in the Dublin Bay North constituency of Finian McGrath, Minister of State for Disability Issues.The meeting will also hear proposals for the establishment of a new commission to regulate the media and to replace the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, The plans are being brought to Cabinet by Minister for Communications Richard Bruton. Also at Cabinet, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is expected to seek approval to set aside hundreds of millions of euro every year for the next five years as a buffer against expected drops in corporation tax receipts."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4134152.1578526210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shane ross going to cabinet meetings was a weekly ambush","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Transport Shane Ross. Suggestions he has neglected his brief for pet projects are rejected as a ‘myth’.  Photograph: Alan BetsonIn a few weeks from now, Shane Ross hopes to find himself in the same position he was four years ago: re-elected to the Dáil and negotiating with potential coalition partners on participation in government.In 2016, he was dealing with Enda Kenny for Fine Gael and Micheál Martin for Fianna Fáil as the 32nd Dáil struggled to make sense of the inconclusive result thrown up by that February’s election.Kenny, with whom Ross had a testy relationship, has since departed, replaced by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Martin still leads Fianna Fáil, and has targeted Ross for repeated criticism over the past four years.“Micheál can do what he likes,” Ross says, before recalling the torturous 2016 Government formation negotiations.“There’s a funny thing about the last negotiations,” says Ross. “Fianna Fáil was much easier to negotiate with.”Martin’s party, the Dublin Rathdown TD said, was willing to agree to whatever Ross and others wanted.“Fine Gael is much more kind of inflexible when you’re negotiating with them.The Fine Gael “background”, according to Ross, is that they “have strong convictions”.Slow progressThe Judicial Appointments Commission Bill championed by Ross has taken years to progress, and has still not passed all stages in the Oireachtas.It was the cause of many of his rows with Kenny, and Ross acknowledges he blocked the appointment of judges at Cabinet because of slow progress on his Bill.Ross says that it took himself and Finian McGrath, the other alliance member who attends Cabinet, a year or two to settle into Government.“We didn’t feel very comfortable in Government and we felt we were almost the opposition sitting at the Cabinet table at one stage.“The first few weeks were real hell. I had a very bad relationship with Enda Kenny, to start with. Going to Cabinet meetings was a weekly ambush.”Relations got off to a poor start when Ross, in the middle of government negotiations, called Kenny a “political corpse”, a term he now acknowledges was “very hurtful”.“It’s the sort of phraseology I use in print. I’m really sorry if it hurt him, because I didn’t mean to hurt him at all. I thought it was just part and parcel of the political colour.”Varadkar’s relationship with the Independent Alliance has been easier, and Ross is a fan of his current boss.“When he came out, I thought it was fantastic. He did something really special in Irish public life. I suppose he’s kind of liberal, which is wonderful, and he has good attitude to politics.”Unsurprisingly, suggestions he has neglected his own transport brief for pet projects such as the Judicial Appointments Bill and constituency issues, such as the reopening of Stepaside Garda station, are rejected as a “myth”, and he points towards increased investment in transport infrastructure, as well as legislation on drink-driving and penalty points.Although he has been a lightning rod for criticism during the lifetime of the Government over the past four years, Ross has cut a more relaxed figure around Leinster House in recent months.SuccessesA number of successes on road traffic legislation, as well as his handling of the controversy surrounding the Football Association of Ireland, have restored his confidence.There have been rows within the alliance, however, but Ross says the four-member group easily overcome their “spats”. Others, however, question if the group gathered together by Ross before the last election will survive the coming campaign, and predict its members will go their own way once the Dáil is dissolved.Ross himself is looking forward to the contest, and says it may not even be his last."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4134738.1578558476!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"good riddance british papers react to prince harry and meghan markle announcement","story":"Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams has called Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s decision to announce that they were stepping back from royal duties without consulting Buckingham Palace extraordinarily irresponsible. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNo one paper emerged as sympathetic to Prince Harry and Markle, although some were reserved in their assessments. File photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPA  Several British national newspapers have launched blistering attacks on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – after their decision on Wednesday to step away from royal life, saying they had shown no understanding of what their roles entailed, and had been disrespectful to Queen Elizabeth.No paper emerged as sympathetic to Prince Harry and Ms Markle, although some were reserved in their assessments, arguing the desire for less scrutiny by splitting their time on both sides of the Atlantic might have been understandable, especially since the birth of son Archie.But others were far more scathing.The Daily Mirror, one of three papers facing lawsuits from the couple, fumed in its coverage about “an extraordinary day in the history of the royal family”. One comment piece in particular pulled no punches.“And he didn’t even have the guts or decency to tell her, or his own father, of the bombshell he was about to drop in their laps.”“Well, good riddance,” Bletchly added. “I for one have had a bellyful of Harry’s eco-warrior hypocrisy.“The tragedy is he was once the most loved of the modern royals — from the moment he walked behind his mother’s coffin our hearts ached for him. Then he met Meghan. But boy, she changed our Harry.”The left-leaning Mirror’s main editorial was more more tempered, but did round on the couple for not first informing the queen or other family members.“It shows shocking disregard for a woman whose entire life has been ruled by a sense of public duty and honour,” the editorial said. “This is also enormously hurtful to Harry’s father and brother, our future kings.”The Daily Mail — whose sister publication the Mail on Sunday is also being sued by the couple — devoted its first 17 pages to the “astonishing statement” by the “rogue royals”.Veteran columnist AN Wilson termed their exclusion of the queen “an atrocious lapse of judgement”, although he added the “abdication” would strengthen the institution of the monarchy.“The truth is that this charming, intelligent, beautiful woman hadn’t a clue what the monarchy really is, or what role minor members of the Royal Family have to play in public life,” Wilson wrote of Ms Markle.“For his part, Harry perhaps didn’t fully understand his own role as a younger son. Both seemed oblivious to the fact that the British monarchy is a delicate constitutional miracle, not a vehicle for its members to press home their views on the subjects that interest them, however noble.”He said the couple would now be free of “the awkward sense that you have no clear role to play in British public life”.Mail columnist Sarah Vine said the couple had “hardly had a chance to understand what the job really entails before handing in their resignation”.“It’s almost as though they never really had any intention of trying to stick it out at all, as though right from the start the notion was always there in the back of their minds that if life as Duke and Duchess didn’t live up to expectation, they would simply leave,” she wrote.In its main editorial, the Mail said Prince Harry had pressed the “nuclear button” on his royal career, delivering a hammer blow to the queen, his family, and the monarchy, and tossing years of goodwill built up since the death of his mother Diana “into the hazard”.“To them, it is ‘an exciting next step’. To most of us, it sounds like having your cake and eating it. They want the status of being ‘senior’ Royals but the privacy and freedom of being private citizens,” the editorial said.The  was relatively placid in its editorial, aside from highlighting the lack of family consultation. Columnist Margaret Holder, however, said the couple had “consistently failed to understand that a tax-paying public expects the Royal Family to be relevant, relatable and value for money”.“In trying to hide the place of Archie’s birth and refusing to name his godparents they pushed aside the public in a way not done by any other royals,” Holder wrote.The Times’ editorial said the announcement carried all the signs of the “petulance and hot-headedness for which Prince Harry is sadly becoming well-known”.“This latest outburst appears to have been triggered in part by anger at recent images released by the Palace that signalled a shift to a more slimmed down monarchy,” it said. “This included a photo of the Queen with Princes Charles, William and George.

Be it the legions of little girls brought up on Grimm’s Fairytales, and later the Disney canon, to the early incarnation of our prime minister, demanding to rule the world like some demented, mop-haired Sauron, no matter how fleetingly, it is almost universally experienced.No doubt Meghan Markle once dreamed of it, too, when she was young, and then again, rather more regularly, some years later, having met one of the few princes left in Europe with a seat of any consequence. But that dream appears to be at an end following yesterday’s announcement that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decided step back from their roles as senior royals and aim to become self-sufficient. In doing so, they have put both themselves, and the royal family, in a difficult position.In truth, the decision is probably for the best, at least for the couple. They have no real chance of ever acceding to the throne and will only ever be a duke and duchess. Most people, of course, would take that in a heartbeat – but to celebrities and campaigners, which the Sussexes are, ceilings are never welcome things.It has been clear from the outset of the marriage that the pair wanted to be different – to carve out their own niche, separate from the sphere of the crown. Whether for vapid self promotion or genuine care for the issues that motivate them is beside the point. One can be cruel and choose to see them as a pair on the make, or be sympathetic and view them as people impatient to change the world for good. Either way, being delegated duties by the Queen was never going to be acceptable.But the manner in which they have made their choice, and then made it public, will make things far more difficult for Her Majesty than merely having to find replacements for royal engagements. The announcement that the couple were stepping away was a strange kind of halfway house – that they will continue to support the queen in her duties for the foreseeable future. But in what capacity? Given they had not consulted Buckingham Palace beforehand, their intention could well be to do the bare minimum.When the couple say they plan to be financially independent, many people have already noted this has only come after the great expense of a wedding and house renovation from the public purse, while they can still call upon the Duchy of Cornwall for support. But beyond this, any money they make in future will come from trading on their titles, and fame, as royals. That is unlikely to go down well with the public, or other members of the royal household.Living in this state of limbo – able to trade off their royalty to pursue goals not endorsed by the crown – will be intolerable. It is difficult to envisage how they can carry on in any active role. But it is not the worst crime here – the most difficult aspect of this whole episode is one of respect.The Queen is in her nineties, with an older, ailing husband and a son in disgrace facing permanent public exile. For the couple to make their announcement without consulting the palace first was insulting enough.To time it to make headlines in the US was another swipe to show how little the UK matters to them in comparison with their own PR machine. But to make the decision now, at a time when the family, and the monarch, needed the younger members to put aside personal animus, is in many ways unforgivable. In turbulent times, the crown is the cornerstone. No matter what happens, in parliament or elsewhere, we are all theoretically beholden to it. But no longer is it that we are beholden to the whims of an inidual – the modern monarch exists as the symbol of the nation. An icon to exist in a guilded cage, to lead and unify where party political leaders can only ide.It is not there to represent how we all live or look, but to try to embody the best of us determination, charity, grace, reservation, duty. It cannot always succeed – to err is human – but most people understand that this is the burden, as well as the privilege, of the royal family. It is why, though almost unspoken, most people in this country remain staunch supporters of the institution. Harry and Meghan quit the Firm | Read moreTo sully this is to sully the nation. This is why royal scandals hit home so much harder than almost any other. It is why, having made mistakes before, Prince Andrew was forced to retreat from public life. Meghan and Harry are not comparable they have not brought shame. But what they have done is shown disrespect – to their family and to the institution, which represent the nation.They have made it clear that their sense of duty lies elsewhere. And do you know what? There’s nothing wrong with that. But to preserve the modern monarchy, there can be no deals, and no half-heartedness. The public will not accept royals who are not prepared to accept all duties the role requires from them. Modern celebrity, therefore, is incompatible.The nation should bid the Duke and Duchess a fond farewell – no animosity, no cattiness, nothing the Queen herself would not say. But there needs to be a firm line drawn they are either in, or they are out. Duchess of SussexDuke of SussexComment: That venerable statesman Barry Gardiner is running for Labour Party leader?

drinkers live year half longer","story":"Scientists said that middle-aged people having at least three cups of tea a week could be expected to live 15 months longerTea drinkers live longer, with the biggest boost linked to green variants, a major study has found.  The research on 100,000 adults suggests that those who enjoyed a cuppa regularly lived for an average of a year and a half longer. Overall, scientists said that middle-aged people having at least three cups of tea a week could be expected to live 15 months longer. When a subgroup of participants were tracked in detail, it was found that regular tea drinkers had half the risk of fatal heart disease and strokes. And their risk of premature death was almost one third lower than those who never or seldom drank tea. The health benefits of different teasThe study was carried out in China, where drinking green tea was most common – and appeared to show the strongest link. People were classed as habitual tea drinkers if they drank tea at least three times a week. Experts believe the connection is down to polyphenols found in the brew, which protect against heart disease and raised blood pressure. Because the body cannot store such micronutrients, regular drinkers benefit the most.Lead study author Dr Xinyan Wang, from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing, said: Habitual tea consumption is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and all-cause death.The favourable health effects are the most robust for green tea and for long-term habitual tea drinkers.The study was published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology.Prince Harry and Meghan ignored Queen\u0026#39s instruction not to go public with

long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t.

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science. If Barclays supports the Paris Agreement, it will support this resolution.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response. We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.”A spokesperson for Barclays said: “We are working to help tackle climate change, and we meet with Share Action and other shareholders regularly to update them on our progress.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed.

Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1840 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken. GMDescribed upon release as a lightly fictionalised accountAWIt’s important to occasionally remind yourself thatAWRoma takes two stories – one heartwrenching and intimate, the other sweeping and political – and weaves them together so delicately that they become one. It’s a tribute to the domestic worker who director Alfonso Cuarón says raised him. But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2340 18. The Act of KillingIt feels remarkable, given how easy it is to turn away from evil,CLPark Chan-Wook’s twisted homage to Hitchcock’s Shadow of a DoubtCLLike Ken Loach’s Kes, Clio Barnard’s Bradford-set tale, very loosely inspired by the Oscar Wilde story, combines lyricism with polemic. It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift. GM2640 15. Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)Wes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3040 11. Under the SkinScarlett Johansson tucking nervously into a slice ofAW20th Century Women is a small-scale comedy drama with the power of something bigger.

Jordan Peele’s horror satire is a polished, spooky and supremely well-executed chiller, but works even better as a deconstruction of race. In its sights are peak white centrism, the burdens and expectations of being black in America, and the untruths of the post-racial utopia many were fooled into embracing in the Obama era.

GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1840 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken. GMDescribed upon release as a lightly fictionalised accountAWIt’s important to occasionally remind yourself thatAWRoma takes two stories – one heartwrenching and intimate, the other sweeping and political – and weaves them together so delicately that they become one. It’s a tribute to the domestic worker who director Alfonso Cuarón says raised him. But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2340 18.

It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift.

Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3040 11.

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science.

As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response.

And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton.

A lively debate on social media, which included Piers Morgan labelling the bakery chain “PC-ravaged clowns”, ensured the new product was a hit.\u0026nbspGreggs\u0026nbspwill no doubt be hoping that the new meat-free steak bake, launched last week, also becomes a customer favourite.While\u0026nbspthe vegan launches have generated huge interest from consumers, Greggs’\u0026nbspfortunes have been buoyed by a broader strategy of transforming itself from a traditional bakery into a more modern food-to-go chain, offering a range of products including salads and coffee.Like-for-like sales jumped 9.2 per cent in 2019, Greggs revealed\u0026nbspas it upgraded its profit guidance for the third time in two months. The announcement comes after shareholders banked a £35m special idend in October thanks to the company’s better-than-expected performance.We tested Gregg’s new vegan steak bake and this is what it’s likeUnderlying pre-tax profit for the year will still be ahead of expectations\u0026nbspeven after the £7m staff bonus, Greggs said.“I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year,” chief executive Roger Whiteside said on Wednesday.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like-for-like sales, which strip\u0026nbspout the effect of shop openings and closures, were up 9.2 per cent.“Looking to the year ahead, we face strong sales comparatives and cost inflation headwinds present a challenge,” Mr Whiteside said.Created with Sketch. Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties.

The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

Can’t say I blame themResponding to Buckingham Palace’s move to issue a rival statement, royal commentator Sally Baker\u0026nbsptold The Independent: “They’ve been away for six weeks in Canada working out what they want to do with their lives and they’ve made an announcement. It’s clear they didn’t consult anyone about it.“Now the palace is trying to take away from their announcement. It looks like the royal family is in trouble.”\u0026nbspRoyal photographer Ian Lloyd said: “I am not surprised. People have been speculating that it could happen for some time and perhaps their spell in Canada gave them time to think about their future.”“If they didn’t consult the Queen, it’s not a good sign,”\u0026nbspnovelist and broadcaster Sarah Gristwood told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp”And it is a major breach of protocol.”The royal couple visited Vancouver for a six-week holiday over Christmas, choosing to spend the festive season with\u0026nbspMeghan’s mother, Doria Ragland.On their return\u0026nbspthey made their first public appearance since Remembrance Day at Canada House, the Canadian embassy in London’s Trafalgar Square.The royals met with commission staff and Janice Charette, high commissioner for Canada in the UK, to thank them for the hospitality and support they received during their stay abroad.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0027s really sad that he feels he has to do that. I hope they just take it as time goes on because his brother (the Duke of Cambridge) will need support going forward once he becomes king.Her daughter Maisy Lim, 24, said: I think it\u0027s just a shame. It will be different.But Steve Reeves, 63, of nearby North Wootton, said it could be a great thing for the Sussexes. I just think it\u0027s good because they\u0027re a young family and royal duties are hectic and I think as a young family they should have time for themselves while they\u0027re young with their children, he said. I\u0027m pretty sure there\u0027s other royals who could step in and step up to the plate.But Simon Webb, 73, of King\u0027s Lynn, said: I think if they\u0027re going to (step back from royal duties) then they need to pay the money back on Frogmore House because that\u0027s only just a recent thing. I think also they can\u0027t trade off the royal name. Otherwise they can do what they like.I don\u0027t think they can keep dipping in and out as it suits them, because that\u0027s what they seem to do. I think I feel for the Queen on this if they haven\u0027t consulted with her, she must find that difficult.Madame\u0026nbspTussauds has moved Harry and Meghan\u0027s waxwork statues away from the royal family members,\u0026nbspSabrina Barr\u0026nbspreports:Harry and Meghan should repay £2.4m to the taxpayer - the amount spent on their home, Frogmore Cottage, Privy Council member Norman Baker has said.\u0026nbspThe taxpayer has spent millions on Frogmore Cottage for the couple on the understanding that Harry and Meghan intended to be working royals, Mr Baker told\u0026nbspThe Sun.Now they have changed their minds, Harry should repay the money spent on the house to the taxpayer.As he is worth at least £20m\u0026nbspand probably much more, and Meghan is a millionaire in her own right, they can easily afford to do so.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex plan to stay at their Frogmore Cottage home on the Windsor Estate when in the UK.\u0026nbspTaxpayers paid £2.4m to renovate the Grade-2 listed building, which the couple moved into nine months ago.\u0026nbspDespite having cottage in its name, the couple\u0027s\u0026nbspUK home - located close to Windsor Castle - has four bedrooms and a nursery.\u0026nbspTheir new website sussexroyal says Harry and Meghan moved to Windsor for various reasons, and mentioned the fact that their previous residence of Nottingham Cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace could not accommodate their growing family.Here\u0027s a roundup of how newspapers around the world\u0026nbspreported on the announcement, by\u0026nbspKate Ng:The national newspapers reacted with rage to Harry and Meghan\u0027s decision, Colin Drury\u0026nbspwrites:Several celebrities have also weighed in on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s decision.\u0026nbspAmanda Holden said the country would lose a bit of sparkle as a result, adding:\u0026nbspHonestly I don\u0027t really understand what all the fuss is about because before Christmas the royal family announced they were going to slim down the royal family, just use the main players, and I would imagine that Harry and Meghan don\u0027t consider themselves main players so all they are doing is stepping back, earning their own money and still going to represent us brilliantly abroad.\u0026nbspI mean I really like them, I hate the fact that they get all this kind of stuff in the press and I think, I suspect that she maybe is, or wants another baby and I\u0027m thinking she doesn\u0027t want to go through another year of everyone kind of slagging her off, so yeah I\u0027m all for it. I want them to stay together, I want them to be happy.It\u0027s a shame because I feel that Harry is the more fun, down to earth one so we\u0027ll kind of lose a bit of sparkle I think, but I think we\u0027ll be able to watch from a distance. I think they\u0027re going to storm it.\u0026nbspThe TV star also suggested that had Diana, Princess of Wales lived, she would have done the same kind of thing by moving abroad to represent the country brilliantly across the globe.The Duchess of Cambridge is celebrating her 38th birthday amid the Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s decision to step back as senior royals.\u0026nbspThe couple made the announcement on the eve of Kate\u0027s birthday. It came amid reports of a rift with her sister-in-law Meghan, which followed a falling out between William and his brother Harry.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s a look at Kate\u0027s 30 best fashion looks, from\u0026nbspSarah Young:The Queen told Harry and Meghan Markle not to make their announcement, the\u0026nbspEvening Standard\u0026nbsphas reported.\u0026nbspThe paper said the Duke of Sussex\u0027s apparent refusal partially helps to\u0026nbspexplain reports of hurt and disappointment coming\u0026nbspfrom Buckingham Palace over the statement.\u0026nbspSenior courtiers have warned Harry and Meghan will be punished for this, the Standard\u0026nbspreported.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have updated their media relations policy in a dig at the frequent misreporting of their activities around the globe,\u0026nbspSabrina Barr\u0026nbspreports.Prince of Wales\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shutdowns generally came in response to protests or civil unrest, especially in the build-up to elections.WhatsApp is about to stop working on these phonesBeyond the economic impact, the researchers said the shutdowns were especially worrying for human rights and democracy.However, not all shutdowns were an attempt to stifle free speech. In India last August,\u0026nbspinternet connections were blocked in an attempt to prevent rumour-mongering and the spread of misinformation that led to violent protests in some areas of the country.A spokesperson for WhatsApp said at the time: The challenge of mob violence requires government, civil society, and technology companies to work together.

Which will it be  The acidic lime-barrel, the chewy coconut caramel or the tooth-shattering walnut swirl Labour Party members face that sort of dilemma this week.The contest to be their next leader will begin properly today when MPsto Westminster. Defeat in last month’s ­General Election has left the party’s ranks depleted.The choice of candidates is hardly appetising.If you were talking about Quality Street, you’d say they’re all a bit nutty.Will it be wonkish Sir Keir Starmer, a legal oddball who never blinks, or will it be ­prolier-than-thou Jess Phillips, veering all over the political piste like Austrian ski legend Franz Klammer after lunch Could it be Lady Wobbles  I talk, naturally, of Emily Thornberry, who may or may not be the lovechild of Hattie Jacques and Boris Yeltsin.Her snobbery about White Van Man will probably knock la-di-dah Emily out of the running, although she is probably the one the Tories fear most.What about tough guy Clive Lewis, an unknown fashion dude from East Anglia whose only criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he wasn’t really left-wing enough Wigan lass Lisa Nandy — so earnest she looks asshe could burst into tears at any moment — is also in the contest. Then there is Rebecca Long-Bailey, she of the Mrs Merton spectacles, fanciedby Corbyn’s old Marxist sidekick John McDonnell.Long-Bailey is untested. But so are the others. I was going to shock you by noting that Thornberry, having once been a ministerial aide, is the only candidate to have had a snf of Whitehall experience.Then I realised that she is the only one of them to have actually sat on the governing side in the House of Commons.Nandy became an MP in , when Labour left office.The rest entered the Commons only in .OK, let’s look on the bright side. They should all have a certain novelty value.So how come they feel so unexciting  It’s because they represent old ideas.Tony Blair is nowadays a discredited figure but when he was leader of the Opposition in the s, he did something shrewd.He wrenched his party into the modern era by producing a pledge card with five basic promises. They helped him win a landslide in the  General Election.Blair’s five pledges reflected the electorate’s priorities: Smaller class sizes for primary schools, quicker punishment of young offenders, shorter NHS waiting times, getting younger people off benefits by using a windfall tax on privatised utilities, and a promise not to raise income tax.Blair grasped how Labour was seen by the voters. His pledge card helped address those worries. The policies themselves were only part of the trick. Equally important was the idea that Blair’s Labour was prepared to listen.A quarter of a century on, the next Labour leader should repeat Blair’s trick and be honest about how the party is seen.Here are five basic philosophical pledges that might help to address the problem.PLEDGE : Saving is a virtue. One reason Jeremy Corbyn bombed in last month’s election was that his spending plans were seen as madly extravagant. Voters may not like government “austerity” but they aren’t mugs. They know state spending has to be paid for.If you are a government or an inidual, you can’t live for ever on the never-never.It’s time Labour reacquainted itself with prudence.PLEDGE : Patriotism is honourable. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear a Labour leader say this Yet since the decline of the British Empire, the Left has regarded patriotism as a dirty word. This is electorally crazy.Patriotism is merely an expression of civic pride, of communal values channelled into the identity of the democratic nation state and its Queen.Working-class former Labour voters love American patriotism .They applaud the Aussies and South Africans when they wave their flags.What is so wrong with being proud of Britain PLEDGE : Stable families strengthen us all.I’m not making a point about marital infidelities — MPs are the last people who should preach about sex! — but Labour’s promotion of metropolitan lestyles has created an idea it disapproves of “normal” family set-ups.Add to that its reluctance to give families tax breaks and its strange cultural suspicion of adoption. Former Labour seats are often areas with the strongest notion of traditional family solidarity.A wise leadership candidate would acknowledge that.PLEDGE : Brexit is irreversible. Please. This matter has been settled.And yet that fool Jess Phillips is hinting that she wants us to rejoin the EU. Electoral suicide.PLEDGE : No more jobsworths. Bigger than everything  is the suspicion that officialdom is an ass.The British people are wonderfully tolerant but they are driven mad by petty regulation — particularly when it comes to minority grievances.“Jobsworths” who say that ignoring daft political-correctness is “more than my job’s worth” are the bane of Britain.Who is more intolerant: A provincial baker who hesitates to ice a wedding cake for a gay couple, or the gay couple who take that baker to the High Court to prove a point We all know whose side Labour politicians would have been on.A would-be Labour leader who cheerfully made these pledges would be a Labour leader who could connect with the electoral mainstream.But will any of them do so  Don’t hold your breath.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s been rude to the world’s biggest stars before. Never has he hit the nail on the head like that or with such venom.For too long, politically correct movie actors and musicians have lectured the little people on how to live better lives, lives more like theirs. They tell us to cut back — as they fly around the globe in private jets and live in multiple mansions with monstrous carbon footprints.They leap aboard every soul-sappingly tedious and vacuously “woke” bandwagon and instruct us to do the same.They tell us how to vote — always noisily and cluelessly backing the left, safe in the knowledge no forced redistribution could ever really dent their vast wealth.At last a fellow multi-millionaire actor and comic has told them to shut up. That they’re “in no position to lecture the public about anything”. That they “know nothing about the real world”.Ordinary people ARE sick of these ill-informed egomaniacs. That’s why celebrity endorsements never help Labour here — or the Democrats in the US.We doubt that any of these Golden Globetrotters will have the self-awareness or humility to wind their necks in.But we’re proud that as millions watched, cheering, a plain-talking Brit burst the celebs’ bubble.Every word was bang on their money.WE have our fingers crossed for the Cyprus gang-rape teenager as she learns her fate today.She may yet be freed with a presidential pardon. If not, the already grave doubts about the country’s justice ­system will deepen.And our Foreign Secretary will have every justication in warning Brits about the safety of its resorts like Ayia Napa.It is increasingly obvious this young woman was shamefully treated, by the men involved, by police and by the judge.President Nicos Anastasiades must end this madness.BREXITERS have won another battle: The Government will launch parallel trade talks with the US and EU next month. Excellent.It’s not just that a little competition should generate some urgency in both. Especially Brussels, whose new Irish trade chief Phil Hogan still foolishly seems to believe — against all the ­evidence — that there is mileage in sneering at ­Britain, Brexit and Boris.It’s also that, when it comes to America, we must strike while the iron is hot.We are top of Donald Trump’s list for a deal.

Just because you ignore it, it doesn’t mean it no longer exists.Now research shows that going for regular runs could add years to your le.Running reverses the effects of ageing on your blood vessels, and even after a few goes runners have lower blood pressure than when they started.I’m about to run my first marathon at the ripe old age of , having built up the habit from a standing start.Here are some other good things running does:Weight will drop off you — I’m three stone lighter after taking it up two years ago. Your sleep cycle improves. Weirdly, you will have more energy. Your mental health will be better. It will spur you on to be healthy in other aspects of le.I get it, though. It’s easy to look at the swathe of runners and balk. Not a single thing about it looks fun.While some jammy gits manage to glide around the streets looking effortless, most of us look sweaty, out of breath and in deep, deep discomfort. Because we are.Most runners hate doing the actual running. Occasionally, on a nice balmy evening, you might forget you are five miles from home and the only way to get there is to keep running. But more often than not, you’re willing it to be over.No, most runners don’t run for the joyful act of running — we run for the sublime, borderline orgasmic feeling of having run.I sobered up more than two years ago, which would never have been a success had I not taken up running.I was a fastidious non-runner. I’d tried it, it was boring and it really, really hurt. But as those with addictive personalities know only too well, you have to swap drink with something. After Robbie Williams gave up cocaine he ensured Colombia still earned a few quid by necking up to  espressos a day.Like all men staring middle age in the face, I’d ignored any form of cardio exercise and instead spent a decade seeking the cliched T-shirt look.Abs that could give you a paper cut, biceps like grapefruits and whole hams for shoulders.All that cardio looked too much like hard work. And besides, you didn’t see Brad Pitt legging it round the park in Fight Club, did you Well as it turns out, the abs didn’t materialise and I just ended up feeling miserable. So when sobriety kicked in and I had a lot more time on my hands, I decided to see what running was about.My first go was an absolute tragedy and I am grateful no one witnessed me running a mere  yards before tripping over my dog. It was awful. I was wheezing and clutching my spare tyre, but I had broken the seal.Five minutes later I felt great. The dopamine and endorphins kicked in and I could have taken on the world, although my hamstrings said otherwise.Those  yards became  the next day and so on until I hit my first milestone — one whole kilometre. I was now officially hooked.Within two months I had completed my first Parkrun. Anyone who feels self-conscious about running should join their local Parkrun, as the sense of community and inclusion is fantastic.I’d shed a stone and felt utterly incredible — and I didn’t stop there. I now run more than  miles every week and in April I will take on my first London Marathon. I’m excited but also utterly terried.If you’re a non-runner, the thought of running is daunting.But trust me, aside from giving up smoking, it will be the most rewarding thing you’ll do for your body and mind. As well as the physical benefits it really, really sorts your head out.No social media, no people chasing work — it’s just you and your thoughts. I’ve had some of my best ideas and made some le-changing decisions running along the side of the Basingstoke canal.Just try it for a week. It’s completely free, unless you’re like me and treat it as an excuse to open up a whole new world of gadgetry.You can do it anywhere at any time you feel like it. And, crucially, you will never regret going for a run, ever.Put on any old pair of trainers, stick the headphones in, listen to a podcast, pick a landmark to run to and just go for it, as slowly as you need to.

Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.Prince Harry and Meghan are moving away from Britain as they want to create new roles for themselves within the Royal Family.Following the move, the pair will quit their positions as senior royals and instead split their time between Britain and North America - with Canada expected to be their second home.The decision comes after the couple reportedly spent a successful six-week trial period in Canada over the Christmas holidays.Friends of the couple in both the Canada and the US are supportive of their decision to spend more time across the pond.At this point in time it is unclear which Canadian city The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be moving to.However, the royal couple spent their six-week trial holiday on the west coast in Vancouver, along with Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland - so this could be a possible destination.It is likely they will still be called the Duke and Duchess of Sussex while they live abroad.As they said in their statement, they will still honour their duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth and patronages, so its assumed at the moment that they will be keeping their titles.Meghan and Harry plan to be financially independent and move away from their current senior roles in the Royal Family - but will still support the Queen.With rumours currently flying around that the family had no idea that the couple were planning on making this decision, the statement from the Palace was short.The statement read: Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work though.It has been reported that a royal aide said: People had bent over backwards for them.They were given the wedding they wanted, the house they wanted, the office they wanted, the money they wanted, the staff they wanted, the tours they wanted and had the backing of their family. What more did they want The Palace released a statement shortly after the announcement was made.It read: Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.Friends of the couple believe that it has become clear to the couple that the monarchy is moving towards a future focused on Prince Charles and Prince William.One told The Sun: “They are back to work. They have nothing to hide and have got so much good work to do.But it has been made very clear by the institution that the Sussexes are not central to the future plan.“Just look at the picture released last week of the Queen with the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge and George.”Good Morning Britain co-presenter Piers Morgan slammed former Suits actress Meghan on Twitter for the move and even blamed her for splitting up the Royal Family.People say Im too critical of Meghan Markle - but she ditched her family, ditched her dad, ditched most of her old friends, split Harry from William and has now split him from the Royal Family.

Medics at the Royal London Hospital decided Tafida’s condition was “end of le”.In October, NHS chiefs asked the High Court to rule that Tafida’s breathing tube should be taken out and the little girl allowed to die.But a judge decided her parents should be allowed to fly her to the Italian hospital where doctors believed she was not “end of le” — but needed more time for the brain to heal itself.Sun readers backed Tafida’s parents. It was the first time a UK court has allowed a child to be taken abroad against the wishes of the NHS.And yesterday doctors at the Gaslini Institute announced the news of Tafida’s improvement after just  weeks.Dr Andrea Moscatelli revealed she was “no longer in danger”.He said fluid on Tafida’s brain had been drained and doctors carried out a tracheotomy to assist her breathing.She also underwent a procedure to help with her eating.Dr Moscatelli explained these were all procedures which would hopefully prevent any long-term complications and eventually help her tohome.He added: “She has been stabilised from the neurological point of view and as a result her breathing has improved.“The little girl is able to breathe on her own.“We have been able to continue the programme of care as agreed with the High Court in London.‘’She can now move onto the next stage of treatment, which is not so intense, with the ultimate objective being able toher home to her family.“Elements that were troubling her have now been removed.’’Dad Mohammed, , from Plaistow, East London said: “The medical staff put Tafida on a buggy which means that, at last, she can be moved outside which was always our dream for her.”Construction consultant Mohammed, who is in the UK working, watched via a video call on his phone as Tafida was moved from the intensive care department to a nearby rehab unit.There she will receive the most advanced rehabilitation techniques and hydrotherapy to get her muscles moving again.Mohammed added: “For nearly a year she has been cooped up in a room. Now she is in a buggy, we will be able to take her outdoors and stimulate her brain.”The Gaslini hospital has its own beach — so Shelina and Mohammed will be able to take their daughter down to the sea to feel the water on her toes.Tafida arrived in Genoa on October  on board a private jet chartered by the hospital.The doctors said even then they were confident she would eventually be able to go home to be looked after by her family.Mohammed said yesterday: “There is still a long way to go but now she is out of intensive care we on the right path and going in the right direction.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do I feel diminished, I wondered, very briefly Nah, I concluded, sod that. Good shot. And good riddance. I felt no more regret than when I squash a tick from my dog’s back.Soleimani was a vile man. He orchestrated terrorist attacks which caused death, misery and mayhem for millions across the Middle East and beyond.He was in Iraq planning attacks against our own forces as well as American ones. And he was doing so in the service of a country which has a pretty good claim to being the worst in the world — Iran.Hell, even North Korea can’t match Iran for its support of worldwide terrorism and the multiple murders in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Yemen.Iran is a pariah state, a thoroughly odious religious dictatorship, under which homosexuals are executed, Christians and Jews persecuted.Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of conscience, no freedom for women to wear what they want or do what they want.An economically wrecked Stone Age nest of barbarians whose government has spent the past  years waging war against anyone and everyone — but largely, it has to be said, other Muslim nations.Oh, and shoring up its malign influence across the whole of the wretched Middle East. And trying very hard to develop nuclear weapons so it can cause even more devastation — mainly to the area’s only democracy, our ally Israel.No wonder, then, that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has a soft spot for Iran. It hates us — and therefore the deluded halfwit is on its side. Asked about the killing of Soleimani, he denounced the USand refused to accept that Soleimani was a terrorist.Meanwhile, so-called “experts” have been suggesting Donald Trump’s missile strike will increase tensions and could even lead to a Third World War.What rubbish. As my dad might have put it, Iran doesn’t have a pot to p**s in.The same experts were saying Iran would wait and carefully consider its options before launching some devastating attack. Wrong, wrong again.It waited about half an hour before lobbing a bunch of crap rockets at US bases, which killed no American soldiers at all, according to reports.I’m not in favour of getting involved in the Middle East’s politics, unless they are targeting our people or our interests.I was against the invasion of Iraq and against the bombing of Libya. Against our involvement in Syria, too.But here was a clear case where an agent from a hugely hostile foreign government was fomenting trouble in a country — Iraq — full of US and British troops.One missile got rid of him. Another might get rid of whoever takes his place. Countries such as Iran need to know that the tide has turned. We won’t put up with their continual sponsorship of terrorism.Especially in the north of the country. This month the TransPennine service is cutting almost HALF of its trains, causing havoc for commuters. It’s offered passengers with a season ticket a three-per-cent rebate. Brilliant.Meanwhile, Northern Trains is about to be stripped of its franchise. About time. The service I use looks like it was dug up from a disused railway line in Czechoslovakia in about . South Western Railway is in trouble, too.Here’s what to do. Take them into public ownership. It’s one of the few Labour policies that the public liked. And it would prove that this is a government which will act even when it’s against the Conservative instinct.And then scrap HS and spend the money on improving the rolling stock and infrastructure between our great northern cities.Sound like a plan, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings ENJOYING the Labour leadership contest  Never has the party seemed so hilariously irrelevant.One of the frontrunners, Rebecca Long-Baileywas asked what she thought of Jeremy Corbyn’s election campaign. She said she gave it “ten out of ten”. And kept a straight face.The worst performance in  years. Rebecca, love, the people voted in just  Labour MPs. That means they gave Corbyn less than three out of ten for his campaign. Meanwhile, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is hoping to be deputy leader. Heard of her  Nope, me neither.She has suggested we should have a Ministry of Fabulosity, where “fabulous MPs” think up “fabulous things”. She also suggested that instead of a debate, MPs could have a Strictly-style “dance-off, because we all love a boogie”.Is she six years old  Or just out of her brainbox on horse tranquilisers This is the party, remember, that gave Britain the National Health Service, welfare state and decent education. And its leadership is being contested by people with the combined IQ of a tub of BQ tile grout.Ha.The brilliant Russian comedian Konstantin Kisin has a good answer to that: “If the Russians had been involved in Brexit, it wouldn’t have taken more than three years. It would have been one meeting – we’re out. And we’d have taken a big chunk of France with us.”TERRIBLE news. The left-wing journalist Owen Jones has announced he will be cutting back dramatically on the time he spends talking utter b*****ks on Twitter.What on earth shall we all do  I hope the Government might set up a counselling service for those of us grief-stricken by Owen’s decision.He does have a point, mind. Twitter is a moronic institution. It reflects the views of a tiny proportion of the people and is largely filled with obsessive maniacs shrieking abuse at each other.Twitterstorms, as they call them, matter less than a handful of dust.They are just maniacs, from the left or right, desperate to be outraged.Do yourself an even bigger favour, Owen, and leave Twitter entirely.I CAN’T quite get into Veganuary. I’ve tried – I ate some peas the other night, for example.But I can’t be doing with the ious supplements vegans have to take to stop them dropping dead.Also, vegan sausages taste like the seat lining from a Toyota Corolla.Instead, then, I’ve decided to embrace Januhairy. This is where women stop shaving their front bottoms and end up with vast thickets of undergrowth in which deer and rabbits frolic with gay abandon.Now, I was never in the habit of shaving down near my old fella.

Askedpeople have been urging him to stand or itaposs a personal decision he said: Both is the answer. A number of people have urged me to stand and I initially resisted that.

MPs raised a string of concerns about how vulnerable groups will be protected when Brexit takes effect on January .If theyaposd been put last year, the MPsapos amendments might have stood a chance of passing. But because Boris Johnson won an -seat majority, they were all now more or less doomed to fail unless backed by the government.Among  amendments formally defeated on Tuesday and Wednesday were a bid to force more accountability on ministers over whether there would be a pact to let child refugees join family in the UK. Scroll down for the full list of the amendments The government also defeated bids to give EU citizens the right to appeal over their status to a tribunal, and to match future EU laws on workersapos rights. And they blocked a bid to give MPs a key vote on the future trading relationship with the EU. Ministers have insisted they are already committed to helping these groups - and say theyaposll bring forward a separate Employment Bill to deal with workersapos rights issues. Brexit minister James Duddridge said: Thereaposs no suggestion that this Government would propose, or this Parliament would allow, a change or regression in workersapos rights to make them lower than is currently required by the EU law.  And Brexit Minister Robin Walker said the police on child refugees had not changed, telling MPs: This Government is fully committed both to the principle of family reunion and to supporting the most vulnerable children. The Home Secretary wrote to the commission on October  to start negotiations with the European Union on future arrangements... We will also continue to reunite children with their families under the Dublin Regulation during the implementation period. But Shadow solicitor general Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Government canapost and wonapost be trusted on workersapos rights.  Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: Last night Boris Johnsonaposs Conservative MPs turned their back on child refugees, stripped young people of their opportunities abroad and undermined workers rights. The Tories dislike it when they are labelled as insular and inhumane, but by blocking the Liberal Democrat amendment yesterday to protect family reunion rights for unaccompanied child refugees, as well as scrapping the Erasmus scheme, means they have more than earned those labels.The Liberal Democrats will continue to fight the Conservatives on their cruel and damaging plans."},{"url":null,"title":"divisions labour left hand yet","story":"NewsopinionDivisions on the Labour left hand yet another boost to Keir StarmerBarry Gardiners announcement hes considering a leadership bid points to a fracture on the left that could play to the advantage of leadership frontrunner Keir StarmerShareCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics:,  JAN NewsopinionKeir Starmer is pulling ahead of his rivals \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Ms Thornberry told Sky News: I remain convinced that Jeremy is not antisemitic.

In an article for Jewish News, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, claimed senior aides had sparked a row by seeking to remove language from the document which had appeared in the  manesto. Ms Thornberry, who is standing to replace Mr Corbyn as leader, wrote: “Disgustingly, attacks on Israeli civilians were being deliberately dismissed in a way that would never have been tolerated of attacks on any civilians in any other country around the world. When she complained this was unacceptable, she says she was told the new wording was “very balanced considering the considerable imbalance in the conflict”.  Ms Thornberry said she believes Mr Corbyn did not know about the row, but that senior aides had invoked his name while pressuring her to drop her objections - something I believe they frequently did without his knowledge.

A Privy Counsellor and campaign group Republic criticised the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for saying they would step down as senior royals - but keep a claim on the newly-refubished Windsor pad. In a statement last night the Royal couple said they would step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, iding time between the US and UK.But they added they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage ...as their official residence as they continue to support the Monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the UK.The cottage was renovated at a cost of £.m of public money between November  and March  - refurbishing and renovating five residential units to create an official residence for the couple. The refurbishment was paid for by the Sovereign Grant - a sum of money given to the Monarch from the Government which was £.m in  . The Grant is calculated based on profits from the Crown Estate, and would not have been lowerthe Royal Family had decided to spend the money for Frogmore Cottage on something . However, the Sovereign Grant is still officially allocated by the government - a sort of aposallowanceapos for the Monarch. Graham Smith, chief executive of the campaign group Republic, suggested the promise of financial independence rang hollow.He said: Itaposs not just Frogmore Cottage - theyaposre going to be relying on the politan Police to provide security.And they are going to be relying on their official title to cash in and make a profit on those official titles that they hold.  I certainly think they owe the taxpayer a refund. They have spent £.m on refurbishing their house on the taxpayer. It was going to be their home and now theyaposve decided to live where so we need that money back. They need to abandon their claim to that house. Former Lib Dem minister Norman Baker, one of hundreds of privy counsellors who advise the Queen, said the pair should repay the money. Mr Baker - who lost his seat in  - said: The taxpayer has spent millions on Frogmore Cottage for the couple on the understanding that Harry and Meghan intended to be working royals. Now they have changed their minds, Harry should repay the money spent on the house to the taxpayer. As he is worth at least £million and probably much more, and Meghan is a millionaire in her own right, they can easily afford to do so.  In general the royal family is far too large and expensive so it needs to be slimmed down. In that sense Harry and Meghanaposs decision to give up senior royal status is welcome. We need others in the royal family to follow suit and reduce the massive cost to the taxpayer.Former Labour MP Emma Dent Coad, who lost her seat last month, said: While my feelings about the institution of monarchy are very well known, clearly this young couple want to start afresh.And it would be a gesture of good faith to the public to show that they mean what they say by reimbursing the public purse for the renovation of a home that theyaposre never going to live in. People come to me with ceilings collapsing, black mould going through the walls. Their heating and plumbing doesnapost work. And the public spent £.m on renovating somewhere theyaposre not going to live in.

Max Cresham, , had gone public on social media about his surgery to remove breast tissue and talked of the apossimplicity and excitement of the freedom from your own chest. But Max, from Northwich, Cheshire, had also suffered low moods after complaining of being stuck at home following the procedure. On July  last year he was found hanged in his back garden by his housemate following an argument with his girlfriend. An inquest heard the tragedy was unexpected with a consultant doctor who treated him at a gender dysphoria clinic in a private hospital saying there was no documentation of depression or suicidal thoughts.  The Crewe hearing was told Max - described as being a person full of wit, humour and joy was born a female but identied as a man in  and began taking gender replacement hormones in May the following year. His mother Wendy Cresham said in a statement: Max had previously been diagnosed with anxiety and depression that had been about a year before the gender dysphoria diagnosis had been given. He started taking gender replacement hormones but then began to suffer from acne which was severe enough to lower his mood and he took ious medications to treat it. He then had surgery in May  to remove breast tissue. Overall, he seemed a low mood since surgery - he wasnapost morose but he just seemed a bit fed up being stuck inside the house which is a normal reaction to the circumstances. It didnapost seem signicant to me at the time.  I knew he had suffered low mood in the past but I never saw it in a way that made me think Max needed help. I suppose you canapost know truly how Max was feeling. He had gone back to work and was finding it a struggle but the last time I saw him I didnapost have any impression he would intended to take his own le and there was nothing in his behaviour or demeanour which suggested he felt so low he would end his le. I had last seen him in person less than a week before his death when came around after work to the house, stayed there for about an hour to chat and eat Bakewell tart. Everything was normal and nothing signicant in the conversation. I wouldnapost want anyone to believe Maxaposs le had been sad or unfulfilling - he was a person full of wit, humour and joy. Maxaposs partner Keira Kilgallen said: He had undergone surgery in May  and they had arranged a trip out - everything was fine and we were laughing and joking. But whilst there, Max made a comment which upset me.  We had a discussion about the relationship and whether it was working but at home he apologised and said he felt fed up because he was stuck in the house and he had not been working at that time because of his surgery. Max then began to cry, and this was out of character for him. On the night before his death, Max had been out in Winsford and I had been in Warrington. Max had ordered a new phone and had been posting photographs of himself online and he was smiling. But when I got home there was an argument between myself and Max about our financial position. I didnapost want to make a scene so I went upstairs to bed there wasnapost anything particularly out of the ordinary about that decision. He told me he would be up in a minute but was having a cigarette first, that was the last time I saw him. He did seem drunk but I was not able to assess how drunk he was, I fell asleep quickly. The next thing I remember is waking up at  or  in the morning and he wasnapost in bed. I found out what had happened when I went downstairs.  It just wasnapost representative of Maxaposs character he was more generally happy, loving and fun to be with. A statement from an unnamed GP said: He had treated at a gender dysphoria clinic at Sheffield Thornbury Hospital.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who turns  today , failed to raise a smile for photographers as she drove to Kensington Palace in London.In one image, the mum-of-three appears to be either shielding her face or adjusting the car visor. Kate is understood to be celebrating her big day with Prince William, and children Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, as well as other family members. However, there is no doubt Harry and Meghanaposs shock decision will be a hot topic of conversation during her celebrations. Husband William is said to be incandescent with rage following brother Harryaposs bombshell to step back as a senior royal alongside we Meghan - marking an extraordinary time in the history of the Royal Family. Royal fans have also been left reeling over the timing of the Duke and Duchessaposs announcement - hours before Kateaposs birthday - with some musing it is aposquite the presentapos. One said: They chose to make the announcement hit the press on Kateaposs birthday! Lovely present from them to her. Another wrote: Anyhow, letaposs hope Kateaposs birthday isnapost at all over shadowed today, with a crying laughing emoji.  Russell Myers, the Mirroraposs Royal Editor, added: “The world is talking about only one thing, Harry and Meghan’s decision to go on their own and leave their roles in the royal family. “Kate will be celebrating her birthday privately at home with the family and she certainly would prefer it that way given the whole furore over the Sussexes’ decision to press the nuclear button on their royal careers.”Meanwhile, the Royal Family Twitter account tweeted a selection of photos of Kate and said: Wishing The Duchess of Cambridge a very Happy Birthday!And a new photo was also released on the Kensington Royal Instagram of Kate looking casual in jeans, a green jumper, with shirt underneath.The picture, taken outside, was captured by one of Kate and Williamaposs favourite photographers, Matt Porteous. It was shared with the caption: Thank you everyone for all your lovely messages on The Duchess of Cambridge’s birthday! According to reports, the Duchess of Cambridge had a private party over the weekend for her birthday. People magazine claims Kate invited a small group of family and close friends, as well as her parents.  The get together was reportedly held at Anmer Hall which is Kate and Prince Williamaposs country home on the Queen’s Sandringham Estate. She also joined the Queen and her loved ones at church in Sandringham on Sunday morning. Daily Mail Femail Editor Charlie Lankston told Access Hollywood: “Kate, we know, is incredibly close with the Queen and with Williamaposs whole family. “Which is why she was keen to make sure that she didnapost miss that church service despite it being her kind of birthday celebration weekend.”  Kate previously faced reports of a rt with sister-in-law Meghan after the American actress wed Harry, followed by an alleged falling-out between William and his brother. Harry and Meghan also split their household from Kensington Palace, then left the Royal Foundation they shared with Kate and William. In a television documentary, the Sussexes spoke of their struggles, with Harry saying he had good days and bad days in his relationship with William.

According to royal sources the couple didnapost even bother to tell the Queen about their decision and other members of the Royal Family only found out when Harry and Meghan released a statement on their new website sussexroyal. But Mirror can reveal that the website was registered and created on March  last year - almost  months BEFORE they made their announcement and almost two months before baby Archie was born. Details for the new website which can be found on whois.net shows that the site is hosted by godaddy. The website was designed by the same firm behind Meghanaposs now closed lestyle blog The Tig and has been developed secretly since March. Created by a company called Article whose clients range from aposnational brands to lestyle influencers, it says it makes apossh*t happen for clients in any countryapos The Duke and Duchess posted details of their new working model on the website minutes after their shock anouncement. Just weeks after registering sussexroyal Harry and Meghan launched their sussexroyal Instagram page in April last year. Welcoming fans to the page they wrote: Welcome to our official Instagram we look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements, and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues.  We thank you for your support, and welcome you to @sussexroyal.- Harry  Meghan Within moments of sharing the first picture the page had tens of thousands of likes. Meghan and Harry previously used the Kensington Palace Instagram account, which was joint with the Cambridges. Then in June they submitted applications to trademark more than  products and services using the Sussex Royal aposbrandapos,  including clothing, a newspaper and a magazine.The application was published in December by the Intellectual Property Office. Harry and Meghanaposs announcement, made on social media on Wednesday evening, is said to have taken the Dukeaposs grandmother, and father by surprise. Buckingham Palace also revealed discussions with the Duke, , and Duchess of Sussex, , were at an early stage. A spokeswoman said: We understand their desire to take a dferent approach but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. It comes as the dramatic decision was reportedly taken without the knowledge of the Queen, Prince Charles or Prince William. A source told the publication: The level of deceit has been staggering and everyone from the top of the royal household to the bottom feels like they have been stabbed in the back.  It’s a masterclass in wanting to have your cake and eat it. Even their own staff cautioned against them making this public until they actually sat down and discussed it with the family properly. Harry and Meghanaposs statement said they plan to make a move to North America this year. Their statement read: “After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution. We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen.  It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages. The couple went on to discuss Archie and their plans to raise him with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born. They said: This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity. We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support. The couple have just ed to the UK from a six week Christmas break in Canada.  After theirto London, it was quickly speculated they would be splitting their time between Canada and the UK and dropping their aposHRHapos titles.When in the UK, the couple reside at their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage - which was renovated last year at the taxpayersapos cost of £.million.Renovations on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs Apartment A in Kensington Palace reportedly cost £. million, while work on their home Anmer Hall in Norfolk ran to £. million. They came under scrutiny over the summer for their use of private jets, which were paid for by the couple and Elton John. Before she married into the family Meghan, who had a successful acting career, had a personal fortune of around £.m, according to The Independent.  Prince Harryaposs fortune is thought to stand at around £m, much of which he inherited from his mother Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. A large chunk of their operating income came from the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate which funds the public, private and charitable activities of Prince Charles and his family. In  Prince Charles paid £. million to Harry, William and their partners from the Duchy. Harry and Meghan also revealed they will dramatically change the way the public learns about their lives.

They couple shared a message on their Instagram page saying that while they plan to continue to support the Queen, they are effectively resigning from their official roles.They also plan to become financially independent and will split their time between the UK and North Canada. However itaposs understood that they did not consult other senior royals about their decision, leaving the Queen deeply upset.Princes Charles and William were reportedly only sent the statement  minutes before it was put online, leaving them incandescent with rage . According to the Evening Standard , Harry spoke to his dad about the idea of spending more time in Canada just before Christmas.He then came up with a written plan and asked for a meeting with the Queen to discuss their ideas. Weaposve taken a look at the events that led up to Harry and Meghanaposs le-changing decision. Harry contacts Prince Charles The Duke reportedly reached out to his father just before Christmas, telling him that he, Meghan and Archie wanted to spend more time in Canada and North America. Charles told him that he needed to come up with a proper and well-thought out plan.  Harry sends proposal The couple put together a full proposal, detailing how they would make the plan work, which they sent over to Charles at the start of the New Year. However, they were reportedly told they needed to spend more time thinking it through. They were told there were complex implications that needed to be worked out. Harry asks for meeting with the QueenAccording to the Standard , Harry asked the Queen for a meeting in Sandringham as soon as the family arrived home from their Canada holiday. While the Monarch was happy to meet with him she would not discuss his wishlist before he had discussed it in detail with his father. The newspaper claims courtiers blocked the meeting, but the Queen made it clear that he shouldnapost publicly announce the plans for now. Newspapers report that Meghan and Harry plan to move to Canada On Wednesday, several national newspapers ran stories stating that the couple planned to move to Canada with their son Archie. This reportedly urged them to push forward their announcement.  Charles and William sent copy of statement -  minutes before itaposs published The Duke reportedly didnapost consult his father or older brother at all before telling the world he planned to step back.According to the Evening Standard , Charles and William were only sent a copy of the statement  minutes before it was made public - and they were not given any further information. Both are said to be incandescent with rage , with the Queen deeply upset.Harry and Meghan release bombshell statement However, Harry is said to have ignored his grandmotheraposs request and released a statement on their Instagram account last night. They referenced the Queen in their message to well-wishers, writing that they will continue to fully support Her Majesty The Queen  They continued: We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. The announcement was met with a mixed reaction from fans and critics around the world. Queen releases statementThe Queen has referred to complicated issues in a short statement addressing Meghan and Harryaposs decision. It has been claimed that the Monarch was not consulted on the coupleaposs decision , and the Palace is said to be disappointed.A statement released by the Queenaposs office this evening says they understand Meghan and Harryaposs desire to take a dferent approach, but warns it will take time to work out the details. It reads: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage.  We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. This is what our royal editor Russell Myers had to say on the issue... A truly extraordinary statement on a truly extraordinary day in the history of the Royal Family. Harry and Meghan’s decision to resign from their roles is without precedent – their decision to not tell the Queen or other senior royals, astonishing. This has been bubbling under the surface for quite some time but no one would have expected the ruthlessness of the announcement. With the declaration they are quitting their current roles with the family, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex say they are looking forward to their financial independence. And no wonder.  PR gurus have suggested they will be able to exploit their royal connections to the tune of millions of pounds each year, in truth the sky’s the limit. Well-placed sources have told me the couple want to “become one of the most influential double acts on the planet” - but no one is quite clear what the plan is. Harry and Meghan have suggested that by not taking the handout of the Sovereign Grant they will be free to do what they want, free from criticism and free to sign mega deals with global corporations. If that turns out to be the case, they should start by paying British taxpayers back nearly £million they forked out to do up Harry and Meghan’s lavish home, while the pair of them are millionaires in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"fans think meghan harry stepping","story":"NewsFans think Meghan and Harry are stepping back from royal le because of The CrownPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have said they intend to step back as prominent figures in the royal family - and fans of The Crown think theyve worked out exactly whyShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsFans of the royal drama think they know the real motive behind the decision \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

A team of  dentists, vets and zookeepers can be seen working on the -year-old tiger at Knowsley Safari Park in Merseyside. They give the lb tiger an X-ray, which reveals a broken root in one of Kuzmaaposs lower canine. Bubble wrap, mittens and a duvet were used to keep the creatureaposs temperature up throughout the y procedure. Two specialist veterinary dentists, a veterinary anaesthetist, dental nurse, radiographer and eight experienced carnivore keepers came together to perform the surgery. Vet Jen Quayle said: We’re regularly checking on Kuzmaaposs health and welfare and a routine examination revealed the need for treatment on his teeth. The procedure involved a lot of preparation. The anaesthetic keeps Kuzma comfortable and meant the treatment could be carried out safely.She added: Tiger’s teeth are a bit like icebergs. The tooth that you see above the gum is just part of the story. The canine tooth’s root runs much deeper into the gum and in a tiger, as much as two thirds of the tooth is hidden inside the jawbone. The procedure meant we didn’t have to resort to more intrusive surgery, while relieving Kuzma of any pain and making it much more comfortable for him during mealtimes.  Ms Quayle said Kuzma has responded really well to the procedure. He is one of three Siberian tigers which can be found on Knowsley Safari’s unique Tiger Trail, a , square metre, Russian-inspired natural reserve.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA furious woman has shared horrying images of the injuries her dementia-suffering mum suffered when she escaped from a care home in the middle of the night. Denise Marandola has slammed bosses at Kintyre House Care Home after her mum Catherine, known as irene, was found lying face down on a road in Easter Ross at .am. The -year-old gran and mum-of-four was discovered by police and taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness for shockign face and hand injuries by her family.The incident is now being investigated, but Denise, who had four complaints upheld by the care home watchdog, is now demanding action, reports the Daily Record .The -year-old said: “Mum was found . miles away. She was on a road with no street lights or pavement and had fallen and couldn’t get up. She was found face down on the road. “Mum won’t have had a clue where she was. She must have been cold, frightened and exhausted.“By this time there was six  police  cars out looking for her, a snfer dog was on its way from Inverness and the coastguard had been alerted.“When mum has what we call a downer she tells us she’s going down to the water to drown herself. The home is right in front of water. “It doesn’t bear to think about what could have happened to her. The police said she could have been run over where she fell. Its just disgusting and we haven’t had an apology as a family.” Denise says her mum should have been more closely monitored as she has tried to escape from the home before and disputes theof time it took to find Catherine. She said: “We were initially told it was up to  minutes until mum was found but when I went back in the next night we were told it was  minutes from start to finish.  She added: “When my mum comes out of her room she only has to take six steps and she’s at the door where she escaped. They haven’t moved her to a dferent room.” Catherine, a retired canteen worker, went to live at Kintyre House Care Home almost two years ago when her dementia was not as severe. Denise says she wanted her mum to be cared for at home but social workers said she would benefit from more specialist care.  The Care Inspectorate investigated four complaints made by the family last year and upheld each one in November, agreeing that Catherine had not been appropriately supported when in distress or given the appropriate support with regard to her personal care, hydration and diet. In its report, the Care Commission said: “The service should revisit assessment and care planning for people who live in the care home whose needs are iable. “The manager should undertake robust auditing of care plans to ensure staff are supporting people holistically and appropriate actions are takennot.”  Denise said the home has now stated that they will no longer be able to care for the pensioner between the hours of am and pm due to her needs and the family were waiting for another home to become available for Catherine when Sunday’s incident took place. Denise said: “They accepted my mum as a patient knowing she had vascular dementia and how the condition progresses. They have a duty of care to my mum to look after her for  hours. “My mum’s dementia two years ago was nowhere near as bad. “The place is diabolical. It should be shut down. “I want people to see what’s going on behind these doors.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailItaposs been bugging me for ages, but Iaposve finally realised who Meghan Markle reminds me of.Itaposs Diane Keaton in The Godfather - the pretty ingenue who watches the man she loves be consumed by the all-powerful family business he always hated.The Royals have an awful lot in common with the Corleones. Both families enjoy immense wealth, but are forced to live in private compounds to avoid scrutiny.Their families and friends become their bodyguards, keeping their secrets and taking to the mattresses with them in times of trouble.The head of the family demands you swear an oath of loyalty, and everyone is kept in line by the consigliere or top courtier. Every son establishes their own court of supporters, who engage in power struggles with their siblings and parents.And legal issues can be an unwelcome intrusion, even on the day of a daughteraposs wedding. And there are rules that must be followed. You can do pretty much anything, run a casino badly, go bankrupt, get your toes sucked, have affairs. The worst crime is to go against the family, and the greatest punishment is exile. Perhaps Harry promised Meghan that within  years theyaposd have reformed the Royals to the extent they could be legitimate philanthropists. But in this family there are rigid lines of inheritance, and the next leader is always chosen in strict uterine order . As sixth in line to the throne, Harry is on course to become ever less-powerful in the family business. They wonapost be able to reform anything. But he, Meghan and Archie will, nevertheless, still have to follow all the rules.  When Harry married Meghan she, like Keatonaposs character Kay Adams, probably thought things would be dferent. That together they could reform an old-fashioned institution, and do something good with all that wealth and power.And theyaposve done their best. The Invictus games, the Grenfell tower cookbook, Harryaposs landmine campaign, Meghanaposs Smart Works clothing line helping poorer women into work, and her inspiration to others as a woman of colour.Heck, I was delighted just by her decision to walk down the aisle alone. Marriages are not about property being exchanged between men, but adults making a choice to walk alongside each other. If more people realised that, thereaposd be much less heartache in the world. No doubt Meghan and Harry wanted to continue his motheraposs work as a high-profile charitable campaigner. But they forgot one thing - she only ever came into her own when she left.  Once youaposre in The Firm, your friends have a path to wealth and fame by association, as well as hate and abuse. You have immense pressure, media attention, and political responsibilities.It becomes a matter of crucial national importance as to whether you are wearing a hat, and what this means for the monarchy. People discuss, at , what jewellery one of the outlaws wears to an event you both attend. Every word you speak, glance you throw, or pair of socks you put on has more ramications than an opening gambit in D chess.Youaposre not a person, when youaposre Royal. Youaposre a role. And Harry doesnapost have much of one any more.  So the best this well-intentioned, angst-ridden, slightly-uptight couple can do is to become like George and Amal Clooney - immensely wealthy and intensely secluded, with occasional forays into the public eye to do good or promote a cause, while raising their family in private. Theyaposd still be in a gilded cage, but itaposs one where - George and Amal may assure them - fewer rocks will be thrown at them.And perhaps Harry imagines that this way, they can remain friends with the family. There is no betrayal, no squealing to the feds, no abdication and subsequent exile. You can still go home for birthdays.But it takes only one ill-advised deal with a casino boss, plastic surgeon or drug gang kingpin and trouble would kick off again. Because, like the Corleones, you can never really leave this family.For all of us, it is ma fia - the nationaposs family. We watch their squabbles and compare them with our own. For centuries their character has had an impact on our history, and as long as Royals exist that obsession will not be easily dropped.Harry and Meghan could renounce everthing, and retire to a hut in Snowdonia, and thereaposd still be people with cameraphones. As millionaire philanthropists, they still wonapost be the Clooneys - every utterance will be interpreted through the lens of protocol and family politics. Meghan could neverto acting, because sheaposll never be able to convince an audience sheaposs anything but a princess.No matter how peripheral they become, there is still a potential for international diplomatic incidents. Just ask Uncle Andrew for details.Of course, itaposs unlikely the Queen would allow a polo pony to be slaughtered just to make a point, but itaposs still possible for a former Royal to wind up sleeping with the fishes.If Princess Diana had retained Royal levels of security after her orce, she would never have died in that underpass. The promise of protection, and the threat of removing it, is exactly how the mafia has always operated. For Harry and Meghan itaposs not a choice of which country to live in, or what rich friends to hang out with. They have to pick their poison.The th in line to the throne can become low-profile, stay wealthy, and become ever-less scrutinised the further they move down the line of succession with every subsequent birth. But that takes time, and patience. Radical change has never worked for the monarchy or the mob. Both focus on long-term survival. Harry and Meghanaposs instinct may well be to get out, in the interests of quick and immediate happiness. But as Michael Corleone discovered,you want to change the family you need to stay in it. Andyou stay in it, the family changes you. Itaposs best not to join in the first place.

Royal fans from all over the world flocked to Twitter to share their thoughts and reactions – and some of the posts were downright hilarious.

Journalist Jenna Guillaume shared a screenshot from the  Hilary Duff film, A Cinderella Story, in which the protagonist Sam, finally stands up to her wicked step mother, saying: “I quit this job, I quit your family and I’m moving out.” Guillaume captioned the photo: “Harry and Meghan @ the Queen.” A dferent Twitter user named Elena Cresci shared a link to an article from the Chicago Tribune, which had a very interesting take on Harry and Meghan’s news. Their headline read: “Northwestern graduate moving closer to home after spending time abroad.” This of course, refers to the fact that the Duchess of Sussex graduated from Northwestern University in  with a double major in theatre and international studies.  “Always find the local angle,” joked Cresci.apos Another brilliant tweet came from Justin Myers, who shared a photo of Meghan and Harry, writing: “In , BDE stands for Big Diana Energy.” Meanwhile, Buzzfeed writer Sylvia Obell made the comment about The Crown that we’d all been waiting for.

Harry and Meghan have suggested that by not taking the handout of the Sovereign Grant they will be free to do what they want, free from criticism and free to sign mega deals with global corporations.  If that turns out to be the case, they should start by paying British taxpayers back nearly £million they forked out to do up Harry and Meghan’s lavish home, while the pair of them are millionaires in their own right. The two-line statement from Buckingham Palace last night that included “these are complicated issues that will take time to work through”, paints a grim picture.

The works had stood to the left of the Queen and Prince Philip, with Prince William and Kate to the right. But they have now been separated from the family to mirror their ‘progressive new role within the Royal institution’, said the spokesman. Steve Davies, General Manager at Madame Tussauds London, said: Alongside the rest of the world we are reacting to the surprising news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be stepping back as senior Royals. From today Meghan and Harry’s figures will no longer appear in our Royal Family set. As two of our most popular and well-loved figures they will of course remain an important feature at Madame Tussauds London as we watch to see what the next chapter holds for the them.” In Augustreported how Madame Tussauds has separated its waxwork models of Meghan and Harry - moving the Duchess to be in another room next to showbiz royalty including Tom Hardy, the Beckhams and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Her new position was intended to reflect her A-list roots rather than her royal status. Harry was set to rejoin the rest of the Royal Family. At the time Mr Davies said it wasnapost necessarily forever and the intention was to allow Meghan to mingle in her more-familiar celebrity circle for a while. Meghan and Harryaposs figures were  officially unveiled in May  ,  days before the coupleaposs Royal Wedding in Windsor, and are dressed in the outfits they wore to announce their engagement.They were placed in front of a ft video screen with changing backgrounds. The spokesman for the attraction added today: In August, we split Meghan from Harry for a few days to give her some time with her A-list friends.   This time her and Harry are moving together to reflect their recent announcement that they are taking a step back from royal duties. Harry and Meghan announced yesterday that they are to step back from being senior members of the Royal Family and will ide their time between the UK and North America. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex released a bombshell statement announcing their controversial plans, without consulting any other members of the Royal Family. The decision and the way it has been handled has reportedly caused outrage within palace walls, with the Queen deeply upset and Charles and William incandescent with rage .Meghan and Harry plan to become financially independent while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. they said in a statement. Shortly after the coupleaposs announcement Buckingham Palace released a short statement about their decision.  The Queen warned of complicated issues and said it would take time to work out the details. It read: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.

By withdrawing from the sovereign grant, the Sussexes have paved the way to bank a fortune. No longer bound by royal work, Harry and Meghan are free for commercial deals that could include lucrative sponsorships.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally quit royal le last night - without even telling the Queen in advance about their bombshell announcement.US public relations guru Ronn Torossian said the couple could now get “any endorsement deals in the world they may want”. The CEO of New York-based PR firm WPR told the Mirror: “This news, while surprising to many, should not come as such a shock given that the clues were there for months.“Many will see this as Harry abandoning the family, with increased irritation by taxpayers with royal spending and, of course, Prince Andrew’s ongoing scandal. The Royal Family is scarred right now, but not out for the count. Their legacy is much larger than just Meghan and Harry. “That said, I think Meghan Markle will remain a huge superstar. “Whether this will give Meghan and Harry the lower profile they seem to crave remains to be seen. “They will have to be vigilant in maintaining their privacy, as well as ensure that their new charitable focus is well-received by the public. “While this is a blow to the reputation of the Royal Family, their legacy is intact and will outlast Meghan and Harry.” A well-placed royal source said: “Harry and Meghan have clearly set their sights on becoming one of the most famous and influential couples in the world.  “They clearly value their global appeal more than the institution of the Royal Family and have no doubt been advised they can turn their royal connections into a private enterprise. “The jury is out to see how this will fare with public opinion in the United Kingdom, which is probably why they are choosing to ide their time between Harry’s home and America.” Ever since walking down the aisle at Windsor Castle in May , the pair have struggled intensely with being the world’s most photographed couple. As they navigated public le, both became embroiled in a never-ending stream of negative stories, including a much-publicised rt between Harry and his brother William. Swapping Hollywood for royal le has been particularly tough on Meghan. The former actress, , first sparked rumours they could be about to step out of the spotlight when she revealed she struggled to cope with pregnancy and the early stages of motherhood. In an emotional confession to ITV’s Tom Bradby last October on her and Prince Harry ’s ten-day tour of Africa, she said the glare of the spotlight had made things more dficult at a time when she was “really vulnerable”.  Meghan told Bradby it was a “very real thing to be going through behind the scenes” and, asked whether it had “really been a struggle”, replied: “Yes.” The tour, which ran from the end of September to early October, was unusual for a statement by Prince Harry, , in which he accused parts of the media of carrying out a “ruthless campaign” against his we. The Duke of Sussex’s public statement was issued on the couple’s website on October  as it was announced Meghan was suing a Sunday newspaper for publishing a private letter she had written to her father. Although the move to spend part of the year in North America takes the couple out of daily contact with the royals, it brings Meghan closer to her Calornia-based mother Doria Ragland. The couple’s arrival across the Atlantic could also pave the way for a reconciliation with her father, Thomas Markle, , who the Duchess has not spoken to since she wed.

Darren McGrady, who used to cook at the Palace for Princess Diana, the Queen, Prince William and Prince Harry has shared a series of scathing comments following the Sussexaposs bombshell that they are stepping down as senior royals. Mr McGrady claims Diana would be ‘furious’ Harry, , has been ‘manipulated’ into quitting as a senior royal. And he alleged Meghan, , just wanted to be famous. In the damning tweets, he said: Meghan wanted to be famous. Meghan is famous! Itaposs all about Meghan! He added: People saying Princess Diana would be proud donapost know Princess Diana. She would have been furious that Harry had been so manipulated. I remember Princess Diana in the kitchen at Kensington Palace talking about aposher boysapos ... aposWilliam is deep like his father.

Meanwhile, Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan also took a swipe at Meghan. He tweeted: People say Iaposm too critical of Meghan Markle - but she ditched her family, ditched her Dad, ditched most of her old friends, split Harry from William  has now split him from the Royal Family. I rest my case. He added: Wow. What a disgraceful way to treat The Queen.  Shame on Harry  Meghan. It comes as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly did not consult Her Majesty or Prince Charles about the contents of their bombshell statement. It is understood Harry and Meghan had just begun talks with the Queen and Charles about their future roles when they made their decision to go public.  The couple, who are parents to Archie, plan to ide their time between the UK and North America. The mood at Buckingham Palace is understood to be one of disappointment while the BBC has reported that senior royals have been hurt by the announcement. The sequence of events is likely to lead commentators to speculate whether a rt has developed at the heart of the monarchy.  Harry and Meghan said in their ground-breaking personal statement they will work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support the Queen. But Buckingham Palace warned the couple their decision to step back from the royal family will be complicated. A Palace spokeswoman said: Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage.  We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. Harry and Meghan have only recently ed from their six-week break spent in the Canadian province of British Columbia with their eight-month-old son Archie. Their first royal engagement of the new decade was to visit Canadaaposs High Commission in central London to thank Canadians in person for the warmth of the welcome they received.  It is likely they will be spending their time in the Commonwealth country when not in the UK and may travel to America, Meghanaposs homeland and where her mother lives. Any move to Canada, even for a period of the year, would throw up important questions about Meghan and Harryaposs long-term future within the royal family.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThis time last year, Anna Muffett, a desperately unhappy mum of one, spent the festive period delving into chocolates. Only just fitting into size  clothing and weighing st lb, she was so self-conscious she hated it when people tried to take her photo. “I detested how I looked and had to force a smile,” says Anna, . “But even worse, I hated the mum I had become. I felt like I was letting my little girl down. Getting up and down left me gasping for breath.” Now, after losing over five stone with Slimming World, Anna is a shadow of her former self and this Christmas she was able to show off her new slinky figure. Supermarket worker, Anna, from Rotherham, South Yorks, said: “Christmas is all about children and this year I was a happy energetic mum.” Anna’s battle with her weight began after she and husband, Matt, an IT engineer, lost their first baby, Ethan, who was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect at  weeks. “I was offered a termination but refused, hoping a miracle would happen,” says Anna. Sadly, Ethan died when he was six days old in September . Anna says: “I was heartbroken and spent a whole year crying. I barely left the house and started suffering from severe anxiety.”  Anna, who had been a size  while pregnant, turned to chocolate biscuits, cream cakes and sweets for comfort and hit a size . She said: “I craved sugary things. I had no respect for my body as I felt it had failed me, so it was my way of punishing myself for losing Ethan.” A week before what should have been Ethan’s first birthday, Anna discovered she was pregnant. She recalls: “It was bittersweet as I was so sad Ethan would never celebrate his special day but at the same time, I finally had a reason to smile again.” In April , Anna gave birth to daughter, Robyn, now three, named after the bird that had appeared at poignant moments since losing her son, including when she was in the hospice with Ethan after he died, and on his birthdays.  But when Robyn was a toddler, Anna hated being unfit. She says: “I was too out of breath to chase her.” When Robyn was six months, she was admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis and later suspected asthma.

Charlotte McAteer has been busy transforming her home and had her heart set on a huge fluffy rug for her own room after spotting the trend on social media. Scouring the market, the  year old couldnapost believe her luck when she stumbled across a dream mat for just £. on the online marketplace Wish. The online advert showed a model sinking her feet into a mound of soft fluff as took strides across the huge rug, appearing almost too good to be true. When a delivery turned up in a small Jfy bag, the mum from Salisbury was left wondering what  she had ordered. It turned out to be a very miniature version of the rug she was expecting - only just large enough for her two year old daughter Aoe to put both feet on. Charlotte said the mat is aposas thin as paperapos and can be easily folded into quarters, with the fluffy texture she had longed for turning out to be nothing more than a bit aposhairyapos. Luckily, the mum-of-one was able to see the funny side and the mat has been gted to her more appropriately-sized daughter. I opened it up and it is literally the size of a side plate, she said.I follow lots of home accounts on Instagram and have gotten really into decor and things.I saw all these big shaggy rugs for the bedroom and I thought, aposoh my god, that would look beautul in my bedroomapos with the size of it and how big, thick and fluffy it was. It was £. with free postage and I thought it would either not arrive because it was from China, or itaposs going to come and be amazing.  So I ordered it anyway and it came in a little jfy bag. I couldnapost remember ordering anything that small. Itaposs got these really thin hairs coming off the bottom. I wouldnapost say itaposs fluffy. I took the picture of it under my foot because thataposs how they advertised it on the site, but the person had two legs. I just laughed. I was more like, aposreally apos rather than being worried that I had wasted money. If I had spent £ on it I would have been annoyed, but because I only spent £ on it I think I found the funny side of it. My daughter just played with it. I think she thought it was a toy. Sheaposd only just turned two, so she didnapost really understand what it was. Charlotte admits she had reservations about the bargain buy after seeing it had no description on the private selleraposs website, but decided it was worth the risk.  However, the experience has put her off buying online again after the dodgy purchase. There was no description about it online, she added. Thataposs what made me wonder. I thought, itaposs only £ soyou lose £ it doesnapost really matter. It would have been amazinga luxurious rug had turned up, so for £ that would have been [a bargain]. I thought it was from China. To be honest, I order lots of little outfits for my daughter on eBay. Theyaposve all turned up and theyaposve all been absolutely brilliant. The quality hasnapost been amazing, but theyaposve all looked really nice. Because it was from China, I thought it would be okay but just cheaply made.

The two flight recorders could reveal why the airliner came down in flames so soon after Iran’s ballistic missile strike against US troops. Mystery has surrounded the disaster as the Boeing  was seen in unveried video burning while in mid-air after taking off from Iran’s main Imam Khomeini airport. There were  passengers and nine crew members on the Ukraine International Airlines flight PS to Kiev when it crashed. The plane’s black boxes have been recovered, but the head of civil aviation in Tehran, Ali Abedzadeh, refused to hand them over to Boeing. The Ukrainian embassy in Iran initially issued a statement saying: “According to preliminary data, the plane crashed due to engine failure for technical reasons. As of now, versions of terrorist attack or missile attack are ruled out.” However, that claim was later deleted from the embassy’s website. Any previous comments about the cause were “not official”, the embassy said. A video on state media appeared to show the plane already on fire as it fell from the night sky.  Askedthe airliner could have been downed by a missile, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk cautioned against speculation. But David Learmount, of news site FlightGlobal, said: “Whatever it was, it was very dramatic and very sudden, because the crew were not able to make an emergency call. “They had plenty of height which would have given them the time to make a call. You try to work out what very dramatic thing can go wrong with an airliner...” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d26f37f4c8cf9.13748696-846x564.jpg ","title":"dee must bounce back and secure second spot says keeper hamilton","story":"Dundee goalkeeper Jack Hamilton insists it is vitally important they quickly bounce back from defeat to Inverness and secure second spot in the Championship.The Dark Blues fell to fourth in the table after a - defeat to second-placed ICT at Dens on Saturday and now lag six points behind the Highlanders.Sitting in the final promotion play-off spot is far from where the Dee would have hoped to have been at this stage of the season.However, Hamilton admits they can only look at themselves to recty that and make their path to any potential push for Premiership promotion clear as early as possible.“You don’t want to be coming towards the end of the season wondering where you’ll finish. Ideally, we’ve got to be finishing second,” he said.“It takes out that extra two games in the play-offs and that’s where we want to be, that’s what we’re looking towards and realistically we’ve got the squad to do that.“We’ve got to look to win every game and it’s down to us really. Dundee United are sitting  points ahead so,they weren’t to win the league it’d be a disaster on their part.“We’ll just concentrate on ourselves. There’s no point looking at anybody , each week we don’t look at other results thinking ‘whatwe do this and that’ we just focus on our own performances and how we’re going to beat teams.“We need to start getting three points on the board again.”Ending their four-match unbeaten run, particularly after a morale-boosting derby draw the weekend previous, with a loss against the Caley Jags stung for Dundee and Hamilton.And the -year-old is determined to put that right as soon as possible with three points when third-placed Ayr United come to town on Saturday.The former Hearts man added: “It was really disappointing off the back of a good run of games and it just wasn’t acceptable.“We started sloppy and it just continued throughout. It wasn’t a nice one on Saturday.“In the derby, in the second half in particular, I thought the boys were magnicent and then you’re looking for the same as that against Inverness on Saturday but we started off poorly and that just continued throughout the game. vw, px\"  “We knew what they were all about, they’re sitting second in the league and they’re a good side.“They were a team we had to beat but we’ll sit down and watch the game and we’ll see where we went wrong.“We’ve got to recty that in the next game looking forward.“We just need to get back to the second half of the derby, that’s the performance we’re capable of and we’ve got a right good team in that dressing-room – it’s just about getting that consistency and kicking on from there.“Everybody out there on the pitch knows how good we are inidually so it’s one of those ones where we are frustrated.Dundee - Inverness: Dismal Dee drop to fourth with ICT defeat\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee---inverness-dismal-dee-drop-to-fourth-with-ict-defeat embed # secretXqUmxEai\" data-secret\"XqUmxEai\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“We need to assess the game and look to see where we can improve.“Going forward, we need to get the three points against Ayr.”And Hamilton knows they need to get the fans back on side after many voiced their displeasure on Saturday.“It’s not nice and you can feel and understand the supporters’ frustration.“They’re entitled to their opinion, quite rightly so because they support the team.“They want the highest possible achievement for Dundee and likewise so do we, so when things aren’t working out as we’d like they’re going to be frustrated.“We’ve got to do it for them as well as ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19755586-940x551.jpg ","title":"dundee 0 2 inverness dismal dee drop to fourth with ict defeat","story":"Dundee dropped to fourth in the Championship table as they fell to a - defeat to Inverness at Dens Park.First-half goals from Aaron Doran and James Keatings did the damage as John Robertson#s Caley Jags strengthened their grip on second spot.Ayr winning at Dunfermline meant the Dark Blues dropped to the fourth and final promotion play-off spot,  points behind leaders Dundee United.Dee boss James McPake stuck with the same line-up which earned a point in the Dundee derby with -year-old Fin Robertson starting in the middle of the park after a terric display at Tannadice.Inverness were the first to threaten but Nikolay Todorov could only head Miles Storey#s cross over the bar after three minutes.Caley skipper Carl Tremarco went closer on nine minutes as he got on the end of another Storey cross after a period of pressure. However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e15a20e470462.94595130.jpg ","title":"mcpake demands dark blues take the game to ayr in crucial clash","story":"James McPake has urged his Dundee players to “take the game” to Ayr United this weekend after failing to do so last time out against Inverness.The Dark Blues fell to a dispiriting defeat to the Highlanders at Dens Park on Saturday to fall six points behind the second-placed side.That came after the team gave themselves a boost with an impressive second-half display against runaway league leaders Dundee United after a run of three without defeat.This weekend they have a chance to get back on track as they host the third-placed Honest Men where victory would see them move back up the table.However, James knows his outfit will have to be far better than they showed last time out.He said: “Looking back, we didn’t start the game anywhere near how we should have done.“The confidence should have been there and, at home, you need to be more positive and take the game to the other team.“Inverness are second in the league for a reason – they are a decent enough side – but we were really poor.“I didn’t see it coming.“It was the same  that had done so well at Partick and then down the road as well. vw, px\"  “We didn’t anticipate that happening but it has occurred before and we have managed to recover from it.“That has to be at the forefront of our minds now, getting it right this weekend against Ayr United.”He added: “It is frustrating.“The dficult thing to put your finger on is that we did not make signicant changes.“You can perhaps weigh it up when you have chopped and changed and ask: ‘Were we poor because we brought in four players ’“It was the same team against Inverness so we can’t do that.“They were better than us – simple as that.“They had a two-goal lead and were very comfortable.“In the second half we were a bit better but it’s easier to be better when you are - down and have to take the game to a team. I said as much to our players so we are not taking positives from that.“We have been here before and come back from a poor performance before. We need to do it again.“We can’t afford to be so up and down as a team.”The majority of Dundee’s low points this season have come on their own patch.The poor defeat to Inverness added to a list that includes bad days as hosts to Dundee United, Partick, Queen of the South and League Two Elgin City.However, James doesn’t feel there is an issue for players playing at Dens Park.“I was never big on that,” he added. “I didn’t feel that as a player. vw, px\"  “The basic thing that supporters want to see is people going out there and working hard.“For  to  minutes, Inverness were much better than us and, by then, the game was effectively done as far as they were concerned as they had a lead and sat back off the match.“They were right to do that and it happened up there as well. They are really good at it.“You know that teams come here and look to get through the first  minutes or so and look to get the crowd turned against us.“That happens at clubs that have quite a bit of support.“But I genuinely don’t buy into the view that there is this big stigma or a big problem about playing at Dens.“I don’t get it and it should be the opposite because when you get it right and you get the fans right behind you it is a really good place to play.“It flips and becomes a good place to play football.“The atmosphere can be really good but I have said it before and I will say it again – we need to give them something back.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"youth prospect declan glass has sights set on permanent role in dundee united first team","story":"Dundee United’s latest youth import hopes while form is temporary, Glass is permanent at Tannadice.Nineteen-year-old Declan Glass made histo the Tangerines first team at Queen of the South on Saturday after being recalled from loan at Cove Rangers.And he has his sights firmly set on a prolonged spell in the first team after his first appearance since September .He told the Tele: “I’ve been on two loans, to Airdrie last season and right away to Cove this time, so it has been a while – it doesn’t feel like that long, to be honest.“I’m delighted to be back. Dundee United is where I want to be, where I want to be playing so it was really good to be back on Saturday.“To get recalled early gave me a boost going into the weekend’s game and to go straight into the team was a bonus.“Then to get three points, I’m delighted.“I found out the start of last week I was coming back.“The gaffer spoke to me and I went up to Cove just to say bye to the boys.“Paul Hartley spoke to me and told me to keep doing what I had done up there at United.“The gaffer here has emphasised that as well – hopefully, I took my chance on Saturday.”Glass shone in League Two as Cove lead the way at the top of the table, scoring seven goals in  appearances and winning the ision’s Player of the Month award in August.The teenager s to the club with United sitting pretty,  points clear of the rest of the Championship and on the back of an -match unbeaten run that’s brought  victories.And he feels the spell at the top of League Two with the Aberdeen club will serve him well as he s to Tannadice.He added: “I was still in at United every day during my loan and working under the gaffer so I’ve come into the team in a good position, knowing what the gaffer expects.“It’s going to be a huge second half to the season.“It’s going to be all about consolidating our league position and pushing for the title.“It’s about getting as many points on the board as possible and trying to wrap things up as quickly as possible.“It was like for like at Cove, we were battling away at the top of the table there, too.“I think it probably helped me going out to a club like that where we were pushing for promotion as well.“To come back to United in this position is nice, to be fair!“I don’t think our lead means anything, though – we need to keep winning games and focus on each Saturday as it comes.”The next Saturday coming is another tough away trip to Partick Thistle.Ian McCall’s side are on an upward trajectory with three wins and a draw in their last five matches as they battle to get away from the foot of the table.Glass is targeting another start for the Tangerines at Firhill but knows they’ll have to be on their game to make it  wins from their last . vw, px\"  “Partick are a big club and probably don’t think they should be where they are,” Glass added.“We are battling to win a league, they are battling for survival, which is maybe a surprise, so both teams have a lot to play for.“I expect another really tough game, another battle but, hopefully, we can come out on top.“Last weekend Queens were tough, they are always dficult away, they pride themselves on being a good home side.“Not many teams get three points there and I think we showed a dferent side of us, we can go to places like Palmerston and scrape wins.“I thinkyou want to win a title, that’s huge.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have

Let’s see.“It would be something I view would be a huge advantage for both clubs.“I would be wide open to a conversation further down the road and the new chairman has a broader lens on how he sees the club developing its international footprint.“That will bring the fruits for the first team, youth development and overall success on the football front and commercially for the club.”Formed in , Dubai City boast highly-qualied UEFA A and B-licensed coaches recruited from within the UAE and British football.Champions league and Club World Cup holders Liverpool were out in Dubai last year for a youth football showcase to scout the hottest talent.It was open to clubs from the GCC region .Aberdeen-born and raised Max Foster, who moved to Dubai with his parents, was at Dubai City before signing a two-year deal with League Two Mansfield Town.Kidd, a former Aberdeen youth player, said: “Max Foster is at Mansfield Town and we had another two players who came through the club sign two-year contracts at Bolton last season.“The two players who signed for Bolton were playing for my Under-s last year and are now playing u against the likes of Manchester United.“There is potentially more than just running a three-day camp and clinic.“I see a lot of synergy with what both ourselves and Aberdeen are trying to do in terms of creating a more inter-national footprint.“Dubai is a niche in a very much untapped part of the world where there is a strong international community of youth footballers.“They have the ability to potentially make an impact in the United Kingdom.“It is almost a blank canvas and is screaming out for someone to say we are going to put some stakes in the ground here, invest, commit and get some eyes on it on a regular basis.“I would guarantee that theof that would be a really positive one.”Dubai City FC train at state-of-the-art facilities at Al Barsha, Umm Seqeim  and Nad Al Sheba.In just two-and-a-half years Kidd and Dubai City have forged a formidable reputation in a market that already has academy set-ups affiliated to some of the biggest clubs in the world such as Real Madrid and Barcelona.Kidd said: “We are knocking on the door of a semi-professional league which has the potential for us to jump up a leaguewe were to win it.“Whether that is this year, next year or five years from now, the opportunity is there which would get more attractive conversations from clubs like Aberdeen in regards to loaning or trading players.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

Caroline and Duncan were parents to Calum, who sadly passed away aged  after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Knowing he and his family lived in a beautul part of the world, Calum wanted children suffering from cancer to come to Bute for special getaways where the entire family could cherish quality time together and recharge their batteries for what may lie ahead.The charity now runs several holiday homes on Bute and private flats in Glasgow for families travelling to the city for treatments at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Care and Royal Hospital for Children.Dumfries House Lodge is a -room, five-star country guest house with two self-catering cottages, all staffed round the clock.Eight families have been referred through the children#s charity so far to enjoy a four-night stay free of charge.Caroline said: #To allow Calum#s Cabin families to be helped in such a special way is an absolute honour.

As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"family-bonnie-babies-champion-2019-celebrate-victory","story":"This yearrsquos winner is Rhea McKinlay, who was born on April  in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application. I am disappointed by the decision but it went through the democratic process."},{"url":null,"title":"mekala-osbornes-family-put-christmas-hold-recovers","story":"The -year-old, from Wallyford, a former Preston Lodge High School pupil, fell ill while travelling through Vietnam with what was originally diagnosed as bronchial pneumonia.After being put into an induced coma in a critical condition, Mekala was moved to a hospital in Singapore before she eventually travelled to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.Mekalarsquos mum Yvonne Bonnar McAulay said Mekala was now able to sit up in a chair for several hours a day and was being weaned off a ventilator however she said it feels like a bit of a ldquostandstill time in her recovery.She told the Courier: ldquoDue to everything thatrsquos happened, we feel itrsquos appropriate to put Christmas on hold.ldquoWe will have a wee breakfast for [her brother] Danny: he doesnrsquot understand Christmas so itrsquos pretty much another day for him, but we are doing our best to give Danny his own wee special Christmas Day.ldquoGranny is helping out so I can spend the afternoon and some of the night with Mekala.ldquoIt is a long road ahead as she needs to get her lungs working properly and then concentrate on gaining her muscle back throughout her body, then physio will start.ldquoShe will be in isolation until after the year.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I remember my father saying: lsquoI will give you six months.rsquoldquoWe had a lot of hard times, we were young and foolish and hard up, but for some unknown reason we managed to take the kids on holiday every year and buy them their season tickets for the swimming pool. We had to save all year for them.ldquoFor the young, I would say not to marry young. Irsquom very proud that none of my children have followed in our footsteps.ldquoI would say [in marriage] it is important to always be mindful of one another and try to be toleranthellip never keep an argument going. It is too easy nowadays to walk away but you just have to keep going. I wanted to kill him some days and it was probably likewise but we have had a great le together.ldquoWe feel very lucky to have reached this age and that all of our children have got good lives, and their children are just a delight to have around.In their retirement, Marlene and Stan have travelled most of the Mediterranean and much of Europe together, and enjoy looking after their grandchildren, who all live in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"first-scots-baby-new-decade-born-port-seton-parents","story":"The little boy - whose name has still to be revealed - entered the world at .am todayat the Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health at theRoyal Infirmary of Edinburgh.Weighing in atlbs oz, he is the first child for mother Emma Allan, , and father Cameron Cunningham, , both of Castle Avenue, Post Seton.The parents said they were \"delighted\" with the new arrival.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

on bad parking at the free site near to Tesco in Haddington town centre.The move follows a controversial bid by the local authority to introduce a new alternative car park outside the town centre.A bid for a ldquotransportation hub to the east of the town was put forward last month and sparked an angry reaction from town centre traders, who fear it will put people off shopping in the centre.The council has launched a public consultation on Haddington town centre parking and transportation and this included an exhibition which showed images of people parking outwithallocated spaces in the current -space long-stay car park which is linked to Tescorsquos own short-stay customer car park.Under the heading ldquoindiscriminate parking, the images showed cars and vans parked on kerb corners and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay car park attached to the neighbouring Tesco supermarket."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-electric-bridge-closure","story":"The Electric Bridge in Musselburgh was built to carry traffic

from January , with no plans to re-open in the future.The company has been in discussions with East Lothian Council, which has already bought the majority of the former power station land, over the future ownership of the bridge.Those discussions seem to have hit the buffers after Musselburgh councillor Andrew Forrest told a meeting this week the future use of the bridge was ldquoout of everybodyrsquos hands.Reacting to calls from Musselburgh Racecourse general manager Bill Farnsworth for the council to take responsibility for the bridge, Mr Forrest told a meeting of Musselburgh

opened on race days at Musselburgh Racecourse to help with traffic through the busy town centre.When the power station closed in , the bridge, which spans the River Esk, was closed but an agreement was met with the racecourse, East Lothian Council and ScottishPower to open it for major events.At the MRAC meeting, racecourse general manager Bill Farnsworth said it was used until last year by the Musselburgh Riding of the Marches and was used by the Edinburgh Marathon as well as the racecourse.He described the decision by ScottishPower to close it as ldquodisappointing and said he had been told that ldquoScottishPower do not need it and East Lothian Council do not want it.Mr Farnsworth urged the local authority to try again to take ownership of the bridge, adding: ldquoWe are told the bridge is absolutely sound and in good order. It is a perfectlygood bridge that is being closed and we are urging councillors and the council to try and reach an agreement with ScottishPower.Howeve,r Mr Farnsworth was told that there was no reason why the racecourse itself could not approach ScottishPower to reach a separate agreement regarding opening the bridge in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"groundsman-almost-struck-replacing-divets-midway-race-musselburgh","story":"The lsquonear-missrsquo incident occurredduring the Edinburgh Cup in September when groundstaff had been warned to remember the main race of the day would see the runners go round the course twice over the two-mile event.However, it appeared one of the workers forgot and was still replacing ets on the ground when the horses came round the bend towards him.It was only when he heard jockeys shouting at him to get out of the way that he managed to duck under the barriers to safety.Bill Farnsworth, racecourse general manager, said a stewards inquiry was launched after the incident and the British Horseracing Authority investigated ruling that all protocolhad been followed by the racecourse itself.The incident came to light at a meeting of Musselburgh Racing Associated Committee this week.Mr Farnsworth said: ldquoThe Edinburgh Cup is a two-mile race and our head groundsman warned all the groundstaff to remember they go round twice.ldquoOne of the groundsmen went out and obviously forgot it was a two-mile race.ldquoHe was busy knocking in the ets as horses came around the bend and jockeys had to shout at him.ldquoHe ducked off the track, it was a lsquonear missrsquo.He added that a similar incident at Ascot in November had seen that course fined nearly pound, by the British Horseracing Authority for not following the proper protocol before the race.Mr Farnsworth said: ldquoThe sport needs to decideit is safe for people to get on track during racing, it is weighing up the benefit of repairing the track with the risk.

And such a lot she had to be angry about, and such a lot we still have to be angry about, particularly when it comes to men and womens equality in relationships.In one furious scene, Laurie, the March sisters neighbour and close friend, has had his marriage proposal rejected by Jo and is now moping around Paris, drinking his grandfathers money and behaving like a spoiled child.He attempts to give Amy a dressing down for her desire to marry into money she is, at that point in the film, awaiting a proposal. Amy will have none of it. There is no way, she tells Laurie, for a woman to earn her own keep. When she marries she will be the property of her husband any property she owns or money she might earn, will be the property of her husband any children she might have will be the property of her husband. Marriage removes a womans legal right to herself.\"Donrsquot sit there,\" she flares at Laurie, \"And tell me that marriage isnrsquot an economic proposition.\"There is the most obvious change between then and now. Women now earn their own keep. Their children belong to them, their property belongs to them. These are changes made more recently than its comfortable to think about, but they are changes the March girls would be astounded by.Marriage was a system designed to control and subdue women, and to limit their economic power.But marriage is still an economic proposition. Marriage comes with great financial risk for women. They are more likely, when children enter the equation, to give up full time work and so limit their earning potential and their pension contributions.According to the Chartered Insurance Institute, the average orced woman has less than a third of the pension wealth of the average orced man.Repeated studies have shown that the benefits of marriage for men far outweigh the benefits for women. Married men are likely to be in better physical and mental health than their single counterparts, have more money and have greater social support networks.For women, there is very little dference in these measures between single and married women, apart from money, where non-married women are better off. Other studies have shown that married women report lower satisfaction levels than co-habiting or single women and are more likely to initiate orce than men.In Louisa May Alcotts Little Women, Jo quits her writing and is married off, a decision Alcott, who never married, said she regretted. Jo should have remained a \"literary spinster\". In Gerwigs film, Jo is given a book.\"What I was trying to reverse-engineer,\" she said. \"Was this moment that Jo getting her book would make the audience feel like you usually feel when the heroine is chosen by the hero. I wanted to seeI could create that feeling, but with a girl and her book.\"It is a perfect ending to a feminist, questioning film. But, in real le, imagine we could move beyond an either or choice for women where a relationship is not a stymie to her creative output or stem from an oppressive institution.Couples are increasingly turning their backs on marriage. Co-habitation is the fastest growing type of relationship in the UK where the number of co-habiting couples has doubled to . million in  years.The risks for women, though, are even greater in an unmarried partnership. There is a general misconception that co-habiting couples have legal rights similar to those of married couples, leaving women and their children vulnerable.In England last week the first mixed-sex civil partnerships took place after a law change brought about following a y campaign by a couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wanted a system that gives them legal protections without the patriarchal baggage of marriage.This is common in other parts of the world - from de-facto rights in Australia to Frances civil solidarity pact and mixed-sex civil partnerships in Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.Here, the Civil PartnershipBill is making its way through parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal in Scotland. Around , mixed-sex couples are expected to form civil partnerships next year.For feminists, for the non-religious, for those who want a new structure within which to define their relationships, this is an exciting development and it will be interesting to see how a civil pact, rather than a marriage, changes the way women feel and thrive in their relationships.The ambition of civil partnerships is to create true equality. If the much-adapted Little Women reflects how society feels about women at any given time, perhaps the next iteration will see Jo end up with both her novel and an equal match."},{"url":null,"title":"bafta-nominations-full-joker-leads-11-nods","story":"Scorsese.

How could it be, given what she has been through Having alleged she was gang-raped by a group of Israeli youths, the woman says she was pressured by police into retracting her statement. She then found herself in the dock, accused and convicted of lying.Now she has a criminal conviction and has been diagnosed as suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Footage of her is circulating on the internet. To think her adventure of living abroad for a season started with such hope.There are many disturbing aspects to this case, not least what it has revealed about the standard of justice that exists in Cyprus. Being questioned for eight hours without a lawyer present, harangued by a judge, it was asthe clock had been turned back  years.: Cyprus backs its courtsThen there was the initial treatment of the woman and her family when they tried to get help. The Israeli youths were given immediate and effective consular assistance, but it was not until the teenagerrsquos plight was exposed in the British media that the Foreign Office really started to get its act together.It is not unknown for UK citizens finding themselves in trouble abroad to be treated as an embarrassing problem to be cleared away as quickly and quietly as possible. The Foreign Office prides itself on taking a softly-softly approach in dficult circumstances, but that does not always work.To his credit, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, appears to have flexed more diplomatic muscle and exercised more savvy than some of his predecessors.If only a previous incumbent of the office had done the same in the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe. A better Foreign Secretary might have helped to free the British-Iranian mother from jail in Iran. Instead, through laziness or incompetence, he made her situation worse. Whatever happened to that clown  Oh yes, he became the British Prime Minister.Another troubling facet of this case is what it says about some young adults and their attitudes towards sex. Sex is seen not as a private matter but as a show to be filmed and shared. Those involved in the Cyprus incident are part of a generation that has been exposed to pornography like no other group before them. As a society I do not think we have even begun to grasp the poisonous effect this is having, particularly on girls. Porn, free and easily available to anyone with an internet connection, conditions boys into thinking of women as commodities. It encourages unrealistic expectations and makes both sexes think of themselves as inadequate and flawed. Revenge porn continues to flourish, despite new laws.Who signed up for this horror show, and when are the internet giants going to tackle the monster they have unleashed, or be forced to do so by governments : Teenager found guilty of lyingJanuary, with its cold, miserable, post-Christmas days is the time for thoughts to turn to holidays. lsquoTis also the season to have ldquothe conversation. No, not that one. This is the conversation where a young adult of your acquaintance, son or daughter, niece or nephew, sibling or friend, say they have had this great idea about going on holiday with their pals. It will be fine because they are in a gang and will look after each other, and it is a proper holiday firm, with reps on hand to sort out problems. In any case, they are only a few hours away and can be contacted anytime.Thousands of youngsters go away every year without incident. Maybe you did it, and it turned out to be one of the best things to ever happen, a real le-changing experience.So why not say yes  They have to go out into the world at some point on their own. The arguments are reasonable, the points well made, the case for agreeing compelling. Why, then, does such a conversation leave you soaked in a clammy dread Young people today,they are lucky enough to have around them people who love and care for them, spend the first part of their childhood being told how wonderful the world is and how special and precious they are. Le is Disney, David Attenborough, and birthday parties. Then we pull them up short. Actually, kids, the world can be a rotten, dangerous place. People are not always nice and mean well, and the sooner you toughen up the better. No wonder they are confused.In some ways, todayrsquos teenagers are far more clued up than we were. They know so much about the dangers lurking out there that they can even joke about them. They are encouraged to talk, to speak out when something is wrong. Any help and advice they need is just a Google search away.But that same feeling of empowerment can blind them to their vulnerabilities, make them think that there is no situation they cannot get out of with a phone call.: Briton told she canhomeMaking mistakes is an essential part of growing up. It is how you deal with them that matters in the long run. Resilience doesnrsquot come about from watching a YouTube video, however. Building strength of character has to start early and never stop. When the time comes to go their own way, all the older person can do is stand aside, albeit saying a little prayer as you do. What you hope is that other parents and carers have done their job in turning out people who will treat others as they would wish to be treated.If you look hard enough there are positives to take away from the case of the Midlands teenager. There is her determination to appeal the verdict and clear her name. There is the way men and women, from Cyprus, Israel, and further afield, came to support her and her mother. She began as the Ayia Napa One she was not standing alone at the end.The world is far from a fair place.

The Aberdeen player, who turned pro in , took part in the inaugural event last year in Riyadh, which was held in the immediate aftermath of the Khashoggi killing.Over the past year Amnesty International has changed its tune on what sports stars should do when offered huge sums of money to compete in the desert kingdom.It was said they should boycott Saudi Arabia altogether but the human rights charity now accepts they will probably go anyway but while theyrsquore there they should speak out about abuses going on in the country.What chance of Mr Law taking a stand  Judging from the responses of other players, not very likely.ldquoIrsquom not a politician, Irsquom a pro golfer, said Englandrsquos Justin Rose.ldquoIrsquom not going to get into it, echoed American Brooks Koepka.Last yearrsquos winner, Dustin Johnson, said simply: ldquoItrsquos my job to play golf. And donrsquot you get paid well for it.The most unsavoury response came from the former Masters, PGA and Open champion Phil Mickelson who said: ldquoI understand those who are upset or disappointed. Yoursquoll be ok..He said: ldquoAfter turning down opportunities to go to the Middle East for many years, Irsquom excited to goplay and see a place in the world Irsquove never been.When golf writer Ewan Murray suggested Mickelson could still visit the country without doing the high-figured appearance fee and sportswashing bit he replied: ldquoI could, but given the opportunity I have to go and play and compete while visiting, your recommendation just seems stupid to me, later adding. ldquoYou do you, Irsquom gonna do me.Four-time major champion, Rory McIlroy, could not have been clearer where he stood in the issue.ldquoNo, I wonrsquot go and itrsquos % a morality issue, said the Northern Ireland player. Yoursquore dead right it is ndash just where did Mickelson leave his moral compass Tiger Woods turned down an offer of poundm to play, diplomatically saying the Middle East was too far away to travel to, and Englishman Paul Casey cited lsquounicefgoodwillambassadorrsquo. Yes, good call Paul ndash would have been tricky for a childrenrsquos charity spokesman to sportswash a country whose bombing campaign is killing all those Yemeni infants.Barring them all suddenly coming to their senses, it looks like the European Tour will go to Saudi Arabia at the end of the month, where Mickelson says he looks forward to ldquodoing my bit to grow the game in the kingdom.Somehow even more shocking is the decision by the Ladies European Tour to play in Saudi Arabia in March, given the countryrsquos appalling record on womenrsquos rights.Despite reforms giving women the right to drive and travel abroad, the oppressive male ship system still means women have to get permission from a male relative to get married or leave a shelter where they have fled to escape abuse.More than a hundred women have agreed to take part in the tournament which is being held in Jeddah.

Quite simply, there are none more iconic than our own national dish.“We’re fiercely proud of our Scottish roots and so narrowed down to a number of options for a limited run. When it came to the taste tests, haggis, neeps and tatties emerged as the runaway favourite.”James is the fourth generation to work at the Taylor farm – and is Commercial Director at Mackie’s at Taypack, which produces Mackie’s Crisps. He helps to run the family-owned business with his father, Managing Director George Taylor.The crisps brand and Mackie’s at Taypack as a business were launched in  as the result of a joint-venture between potato farmers the Taylor family and Aberdeenshire’s Mackie’s of Scotland, which is renowned for its ice cream and chocolate.Its thick-cut and gently cooked potato crisps use the best ieties of crisping potatoes, grown on the farm, reflective of its “plough to pack” ethos.Subsequently, Mackie’s Crisps has become famous for its haggis and cracked black pepper iety, as well as launching the world’s first pigs in blankets flavour.Research on its new flavour started in earnest in  during a new product development push, after establishing Burns Night as an opening to deliver a new patriotic flavour combination.Meticulous sampling sessions helped it to master the flavour of haggis, neeps and tatties, building on its popular haggis-based flavours.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Inverurie  District Mens Shed accept the donation from Barratt Homes\"  Funding boost for Inverurie Men’s Shed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The Mackie’s Crisps team were further convinced of launching the flavour when a student, Aileen McColm, joined the Perthshire business in  to shadow quality control manager Jamie McKell.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community. This is the very least that the public and our ambulance staff deserve.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Her remains were discovered in the most recent burial ground, which dates back to the th century and was inside the cathedral, indicating she was a businesswoman of “high status..”St Giles,’ which pre-dates the construction of most of the Old Town, dates back to , when it was built to serve the newly-declared royal burgh of Edinburgh under the reign of King David I. The images have been created under a joint project between Edinburgh City Council and the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identication at Dundee University.Previous work overseen by the council has seen dozens of facial reconstructions carried out on the remains of bodies dating back to the th century which were dug up during construction work on the Edinburgh tram project.Nearly  bodies covering a period of more than  years were found beneath a main road next to a historic churchyard in Leith during a six-month dig in .\u2028The St Giles’ digs, which began in  and continued over ious phases for another  years, led to the first major archaeological study which was carried out in the area.The work covered the site of several burial grounds, which were created as the cathedral gradually expanded over several hundred years. A total of  bodies were discovered during the digs, with the remains found to have dated from the th century to the th century.The official report stated: “For more than  years, St Giles’ served as the parish burial ground for the whole of the burgh, with burials inside for the wealthy and privileged, and outside for the greater part of the population.”Council archaeologist John Lawson, the city council’s, said: “We are revisiting a lot of old cases like this one as we are very keen to put human faces on a lot of the human remains we have in our collections.“These were really important excavations when they were carried out as some of the remains date back to when Edinburgh became a royal burgh at the start of the th century, when St Giles’ was first constructed.But the church you see today was a lot bigger than what was originally on the site. “We’ve got five very distinct graveyards, each covering about  years, with the earliest dating from the very foundation of Edinburgh as we know it today. They were its first official inhabitants.”Forensic artist Lucrezia Rodella, who worked on the  century’s man’s facial reconstruction, said: “It is of a man aged between  and , whowas around .ft tall. The interesting yet challenging part was dealing with a missing lower jaw. “Even with the cranium intact and only a few teeth missing, without the lower part of the face an accurate reconstruction was a lot harder.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable. Possibly fixable possibly terminal."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"belfast celtic contract on display at museum","story":"THE Belfast Celtic Society has revealed a further fascinating piece of local footballing history in the form of a professional contract between city’s grand old team and one of its star players. The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"discover the beauty of africa in belfast","story":"HOW Do I Pronounce Your Name  That’s a common question. No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community. The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":null,"title":"forget bridge tunnel best way to link northern ireland and great britain say experts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

It is going to take all of the parties to make the politics work.“It is going to need to be a sustainable and credible Government. It is going to need to be a Government that actually has equality at its core.”The UK and Irish governments have outlined their proposals to restore powersharing in Northern Ireland to the DUP and Sinn Fein.As of Thursday morning, it was understood the three smaller parties involved in the talks initiative – the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance Party – were still awaiting full briefings about what the deal contains.Another mandatory coalition executive can only be formed with the buy-in of the DUP and Sinn Fein.The document represents the governments’ joint assessment of what a compromise deal to resolve outstanding disputes over the Irish language and Assembly voting practices might look like.They are urging the parties to sign up to the agreement ahead of Monday’s talks deadline.On that day, legislation to give civil servants extra powers to run the region’s troubled public services expires and the UK government assumes a legal duty to call a fresh Assembly election."},{"url":null,"title":"new assembly members take up seats","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think one of the things we did well is that he did the Saturday breakfast show and then I did the show after him.\"So what we did was we kind of developed a double act which we called Connor and Clements.

He said: \"I think he was going to do that this year. He had plans, he had a few things in the pipeline this year I think which were really exciting things.\"An emotional Connor choked back the tears when asked how he would remember his old friend and former colleague.He said: \"I know how Ill always remember him. Cool FM was being taken over by Bauer at the time, who were coming over to rejig things and we had new bosses and we all had to go into the office for a meeting - it literally was all of us going into the office to find out whether our jobs were there or not because they were streamlining everything.\"And Henry Owens - God rest him, hes no longer with us either - said in a thick Cork accent: Stephen, listen, I really like you on the radio and you bring something new. Its great, I love what youre doing but... every time you talk on the radio, you dont have to be funny.\"And like I said in my tweet yesterday, Im delighted he ignored that. I am delighted he ignored everything that he said because every time Stephen did speak on the radio, there was something.\"He added: \"He was himself on air.

It comes after the Derry News reported that members of the public raised the prospect of a pigeon cull due to what they believe to be excessive numbers. The council advised against feeding pigeons as it’s understood that the number of pigeons attracted to an area depends on the food available. Founder of Foyle Wildle Rescue, Niamh McManus described as “contemptible” the local council’s position on advising people “not to support our city centre wildle”. She said: “I want to get as many of us together as possible on Saturday to feed our wee citys feathered residents. googletag.cmd.push “Leave the bread at home, it’s filling but not great nutritionally, and instead come buy a wee bag of bird food from me. All money raised I’ll be going towards the ‘Dirty Swanchez’ the swans upcoming surgery. “Be the change you want to see in the world. We destroyed their homes to build our own and decimated their natural food sources with tarmac and concrete. We owe them lunch.” She added: “My role will be to provide guidance on safe foods for our city centre wildle as well as correct the misinformation about their unearned reputations as being health and safety hazards. googletag.cmd.push “I will be bringing along a big sack of feed that’s safe for our city birds and will not attract pests such as rats. I will be giving this away with any donations given inbeing used to fun Dirty Swanchez orthopaedic surgery on his wing.” Swanchezcrashed down in a front garden in Strathfoyle, breaking his wing. Poor condition due to a fungal infection, aspergillosis, led to the bad landing - which incidentally, is never found in pigeons but often in pet birds. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms McManus said: “Today he was dropped off with Kieran Corry, a wildle vet who is a specialist in orthopaedics in Omagh as there isnt a single vet in Derry qualied to pin the humerus of a swan “He is under general anaesthetic as we speak and is getting good and fixed up so he can be back on the water again within  weeks.”  ‘Winged rats’ Ms McManus said pigeons are actually the only birds native to our shores that are resistant to avian flu. An old Woody Allen sketch where they talked about pigeons being known as good omens is in part responsible for their bad reputation. The director comedian made the joke that they were rats with wings, coining the phrase that ultimately sullied the bird. “The reality is, we are no longer simply encroaching on habitat, but destroying it entirely. Wild spaces are levelled and built on, or manicured to the point of being a green dessert where wildle are not being afforded natural, wild habitat to thrive, e.g. Brooke Park. “Whilst we continue to behave like locusts on the land, our wildle have no choice but to live amongst us. Its a privilege we won’t have for long given the steady decrease in our wildle numbers. “Derry is a greener city than most, yet the wildle population is poor in comparison,” added Ms McManus. Last year, an infection linked to pigeon droppings was a contributing factor in the death of a child at a Glasgow hospital. The child was being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital when he or she appears to have caught the infection - a fungus called cryptococcus. However, experts, including Ms McManus, have confirmed that cryptococcus is “very uncommon” in the UK. She said: “Its seen more commonly in owls and birds that jest and roost in trees. “The source is usually from wood, then can be carried by songbirds etc. Whilst they rarely succumb to the condition, it can cause secondary fungal infections when those birds are eaten by raptors as they don’t have the same immunity to the condition. “Pigeons tend to not eat carrion. Owls, etc, are a dferent story. Trichomonas is more likely to affect pigeons. This is not transmissible to any mammals though,” she concluded. Pigeon feeding will begin at pm in Guildhall Square, Saturday  January.

Founder of Foyle Wildle Rescue, Niamh McManus described as “contemptible” the local council’s position on advising people “not to support our city centre wildle”. She said: “I want to get as many of us together as possible on Saturday to feed our wee citys feathered residents. googletag.cmd.push “Leave the bread at home, it’s filling but not great nutritionally, and instead come buy a wee bag of bird food from me. All money raised I’ll be going towards the ‘Dirty Swanchez’ the swans upcoming surgery. “Be the change you want to see in the world. We destroyed their homes to build our own and decimated their natural food sources with tarmac and concrete. We owe them lunch.” She added: “My role will be to provide guidance on safe foods for our city centre wildle as well as correct the misinformation about their unearned reputations as being health and safety hazards. googletag.cmd.push “I will be bringing along a big sack of feed that’s safe for our city birds and will not attract pests such as rats. I will be giving this away with any donations given inbeing used to fun Dirty Swanchez orthopaedic surgery on his wing.” Swanchezcrashed down in a front garden in Strathfoyle, breaking his wing. Poor condition due to a fungal infection, aspergillosis, led to the bad landing - which incidentally, is never found in pigeons but often in pet birds. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms McManus said: “Today he was dropped off with Kieran Corry, a wildle vet who is a specialist in orthopaedics in Omagh as there isnt a single vet in Derry qualied to pin the humerus of a swan “He is under general anaesthetic as we speak and is getting good and fixed up so he can be back on the water again within  weeks.”  ‘Winged rats’ Ms McManus said pigeons are actually the only birds native to our shores that are resistant to avian flu. An old Woody Allen sketch where they talked about pigeons being known as good omens is in part responsible for their bad reputation. The director comedian made the joke that they were rats with wings, coining the phrase that ultimately sullied the bird. “The reality is, we are no longer simply encroaching on habitat, but destroying it entirely. Wild spaces are levelled and built on, or manicured to the point of being a green dessert where wildle are not being afforded natural, wild habitat to thrive, e.g. Brooke Park. “Whilst we continue to behave like locusts on the land, our wildle have no choice but to live amongst us. Its a privilege we won’t have for long given the steady decrease in our wildle numbers. “Derry is a greener city than most, yet the wildle population is poor in comparison,” added Ms McManus. Last year, an infection linked to pigeon droppings was a contributing factor in the death of a child at a Glasgow hospital. The child was being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital when he or she appears to have caught the infection - a fungus called cryptococcus. However, experts, including Ms McManus, have confirmed that cryptococcus is “very uncommon” in the UK. She said: “Its seen more commonly in owls and birds that jest and roost in trees. “The source is usually from wood, then can be carried by songbirds etc. Whilst they rarely succumb to the condition, it can cause secondary fungal infections when those birds are eaten by raptors as they don’t have the same immunity to the condition. “Pigeons tend to not eat carrion. Owls, etc, are a dferent story. Trichomonas is more likely to affect pigeons. This is not transmissible to any mammals though,” she concluded. Pigeon feeding will begin at pm in Guildhall Square, Saturday  January.

His kick-outs were ied and accurate.  – Karl McKaigue Adrian Mullen scored - in Ballyhales campaign but McKaigue kept him to just two touches in the first-half before also holding Eoin Cody scoreless after the break.  – Shane McGuigan Tasked with picking up TJ Reid, McGuigan held him to a point from play and followed him when he went to full-back after half-time. An imposing performance. googletag.cmd.push  - Pearse Dallas Dallas held Conaghys Bill Murphy scoreless in Saturdays All-Ireland semi-final. As his side gathered early second-half momentum, he got involved in their plans.  – Enda Downey More renowned as a forward, Downey basked in the freedom of a role at wing-back where his relentless workrate helped Lavey build from defence.  – Gerald Bradley – Swept up a series of Ballyhale attacks in the first-half of Sundays epic All-Ireland semi-final clash. Pushed up on Ronan Corcoran for Dean Masons puck-outs.   – Conleth McShane McShane was the dynamo in the middle third for Derry Us draw against Donegal. He saw a goal chance come off the post and passed to Tiarnaacuten McHugh for his goal. googletag.cmd.push  – Chrissy McKaigue If anyone wanted to know the pitch of Slaughtneils challenge, they needed to look no further than the skippers opening point and he led by example throughout. He was dominant on Conor Walsh before the Ballyhale man was replaced at the break.  – Jamie Duggan For the second game in a row, he blotted out the oppositions star man but his time he weighed in with two points to put Lavey on track for Ulster glory.  - SL McGoldrick Landed - in the Eoghan Rua cause and played deep to counteract the Conahy midfield influence but was still able to contribute to their attacking game.  – Finatan Bradley Bradley was an effective link in Derrys half-forward line. He handled more than his fair share of possession. Was moved to centre-back late on and the Oakleafers missed him when he was black-carded.  – Kealan Friel The Bellaghy man thumped over a brilliant score but wasnt afraid to muck in and work. His long kicking bypassed Donegals sweeper and he used his strength to stop the runner in the first-half.  - Calum Downey For the third game of Laveys run to Ulster glory, Downey was the fulcrum of their attack. Every ball played in stuck to him and he scored two vital points of his own.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers started inside but still was able to peel wide and win puck-outs. He scored a point off his left side, before hitting a wonder score off this right at the end of a lung-busting run and his inidual goal gave Slaughtneil a chance of victory late on.  - Brian Cassidy Cassidy kept his best performance of the season for the biggest challenge that came knocking on the Slaughtneil door. Pinged three points and put Richie Reid on the back foot throughout. Worked hard to cover midfield when Gerald Bradley dropped back.

The term’s fund-raising activities culminated on Thursday, December  with the annual Mission Day, raising funds for the Loreto Missions Worldwide.Loreto’s Mission Day is the College’s annual fun day to promote fair trade, the Millennium Goals and the Loreto Missions worldwide. The day allows students from all year groups to become involved in a iety of activities such as quizzes, sporting challenges and games of skill, with the focal point being the Loreto Christmas Market in the College Hall. Fair Trade gts as well as pre-loved cuddly toys, books, jewellery and fashion accessories were on sale, and for some a definite highlight was the range of seasonal treats on offer in the cafeacute run by Year  students in the College’s Home Economics suite. The College was particularly grateful to McAtamney’s Butchers, who supplied bacon and sausages, and to Pappy’s Bakery Dunloy, who supplied sodas for the Cafeacute, both very generously donating the tasty treats free of charge.Students also enjoyed taking part in a range of inflatable challenges, to say nothing of the tightly-contested soccer tournament, in memory of Reece Meenan. There was also a very entertaining novelty race contested by a number of very athletic members of staff disguised in a range of Christmas costumes, which brought the morning to a very rousing conclusion.The College’s Justice League used the day as an opportunity to foreground climate change, and they worked hard to ensure that drinks containers were recycled, plastic straws and cutlery were replaced by sustainable alternatives, and that students had the opportunity to offset their meat purchases in the Cafeacute.In the afternoon, many students enjoyed forming a lively audience for Loreto’s Got Talent, organised by the College’s Head Girl, Ailbhe McGuckian and Head Boy, Aidan McFerran, along with an enthusiastic team of senior prefects, led by Shannon Dickey and Claire White as comperes. This year’s Loreto’s Got Talent competition was very tightly contested: the winner were singers Bobby and Caitlin, while the runners up were Cora Harkin and Halle Ramsay. There was a rapturous reception for aperformance by  winner Abigail McMullan, and for a group of staff members who performed at the end of the afternoon.Other activities on the day included challenges for Year  and Year  students and form teachers based on popular TV programme I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, computer console gaming competitions and Lego challenges, a smore-making room and a Live Lounge run by some of the College’s most accomplished musicians.An impressive total of just over pound was raised on the day for the Loreto Missions.Mr Michael James, Principal of Loreto College, paid tribute to all the students and staff who had worked so hard in these endeavours, under the leadership of Social Justice Co-ordinator, Mrs Lorraine McCool and Mission Day Co-ordinator, Mrs Mabel McAleese. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The policy aims to increase understanding of menopause within the workplace, reduce absenteeism and provide support to manage menopausal symptoms at work. The Foyleside Councillor said: “I am proud to have introduced this policy to Council and now to have it validated at Tuesday’s meeting.“With up to  per cent of women experiencing this natural transition currently in work, many of whom are suffering silently due to fear or embarrassment, it’s time this issue was addressed openly.“I was shocked to see how little research has been done into this matter. The statistics I uncovered revealed how much the symptoms of menopause and peri-menopause can negatively affect women in the workplace and how little support is out there by means of understanding and support. The menopause can cause women to lose confidence in their work through symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hot flushes, brain fog, exhaustion and much more, all resulting from the associated hormonal changes of the stage.“This has caused many to feel overwhelmed enough to consider either cutting hours or stopping work completely.“As a Council we can dictate and affect the policies of our organisation, therefore this is why, through a formal motion, I called for the much needed introduction of supportive services for our staff. I am hopeful that this move will act as an example to other employers in our city and district and will encourage many open conversations on a subject which has been too long ignored and avoided. “Women are an incredible asset to any workforce and we should be doing everything in our power to enable and empower them to stay there. This adoption by Council marks a further step in getting women the support and understanding they need in the workplace.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club Chairman has been the financial rock behind the club in recent years, and after revealing that he had increased Declan Devines budget by % earlier this week, his statement that he is going nowhere, despite his growing business responsibilities, was met with relief and delight amongst the fans, with one stating that ODoherty is the best signing that the club has ever made.ODoherty has business interests in Donegal, Dubai and America to name a few, but Derry City will always be at his heart. “I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “The only issue I have is that I travel probably about  per cent of my time but I’m here for the foreseeable future.“I’ve got three factories around the world and we’re looking at other locations around the world. But no matter where I am, I’m going to be there for Derry City.“Dodieis doing a great job running the office and Declan doesn’t need looking after. I don’t try to micro manage any of these guys, they all do their jobs.“We meet once every two or three weeks. Hecan email me or ring me anytime but in terms of face to face meetings, it’s about every two or three weeks.” googletag.cmd.push Delighted with progressODoherty brought Devine back to the club last season, and watched as the former goalkeeper, alongside his staff and a brand new playing squad, finished in fourth place, bringing European qualication and European money back to the club.I was absolutely delighted with last season, ODoherty continued. The way we ended the season before was demoralising to say the least.This manand the team he brought with him and the players he brought in did really well. They met all our expectations and more. I think were in a stronger place now but we still have a fair bit to go in terms of signings.Declans budget has been increased by  per cent on last year, he confirmed. We havent increased the ticket prices and were expecting a wee bit more sponsorship but not much more.Theres a fair amount of effort put in by the Board of Directors to basically to give Declan a bigger budget so he can compete at an even higher level than last year.Dundalk will be very hard to peg back, he added. All I can do is my bit and give hima bit more for his budget but still keep the club on a sound financial footing.Running the football club is a constant challenge for all involved, and ODoherty knows that will not change in . The Chairman though is determined to make his local club competitive.“It’s going to cost pound million to run the football club this year,” he stated. “That basically comes from contributions, sponsorship, gate receipts.“One of the disadvantages we have is we pay VAT on all our gate receipts, whether they’re season tickets or inidual match tickets. That’s a  per cent disadvantage on that part of our income. So we are hamstrung with that unlike other League of Ireland clubs because there’s no VAT on sporting events in the Republic.“Were making an effort in terms of increasing the budget and I do think we will challenge again this year.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The result is Belfast: City of Light, a new book in which she shares her experiences and asks some pertinent questions on matters of faith and beliefs.Bronagh began her journey as a non-churchgoer. Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast. At the same time she explored her own upbringing during the Troubles and heard many stories from people in Belfast of experience she only saw on TV growing up and often switched off in horror.She spent three years based in North Belfast, between the republican New Lodge and loyalist Tigers Bay areas. Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register. However, this does not currently exist.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, a letter from the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health confirmed that there are no plans in place at present to introduce so-called opt out legislation.However, Mr Richard Pengelly said that work is continuing to achieve higher rates of donation and transplantation to ensure that more people are able to receive the gt of an organ.It is estimated that someone dies every six weeks in Northern Ireland waiting for an organ donation.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen said she was not surprised at the content of Mr Pengelleyrsquos letter, explaining that there is not much he can do without the required legislation being in place.ldquoIs there anything we can do at council level  she asked.ldquoA lot of the things we would hear on this issue from people is that it is something they have never really thought about or spoken to their family about.

Is there anything that we can do to educate people and push a bit more on this issue as far as people putting themselves on the donor register  she asked.Cllr Roisin Mulgrew said organ donation was an issue she highlighted during her year as the districtrsquos first citizen, explaining that workshops were held involving a number of young people who spoke with representatives from the ldquoBraveheart organisation.She described the event as ldquohugely successful and suggested the organ donation issue could be one for discussions across the districtrsquos DEAs.Cllr Mulgrew added: ldquoOrgan donation is a conversation families hope that they do not have to have. There is an appetite for information on this issue.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews also backed the suggestion for the organ donation issue to be discussed at DEA level and said it should also be discussed with the Education Authority and local health trusts.Council director Michael Lipsett confirmed that he will be bringing a report on the organ donation issue to a future meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.He said the report will focus on how the council is going to approach the issue and will contain information on its work with the Public Health Authority, local health trusts and Education Authority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 PSNI.jpg","title":"PSNI helicopter used in search after attempted burglaries at weekend  ","story":"POLICE have been praised for their swt response to an incident in Killyleagh last Sunday after reports of attempted break-ins at homes in the town.A helicopter was deployed as part of a major operation which subsequently resulted in the arrest of a  year-old man near Killinchy.Connor Martin Haughey, of Forest Street, Belfast, appeared in court in Newtownards yesterday charged with a series of offences including burglary, taking and damaging a vehicle, no insurance and possessing as an article with a blade or point in a public place.The case was adjourned, with Haughey remanded in custody until January  when he is due to appear at Downpatrick Court.The ious charges he faces are in connection with burglaries in the Saintfield and Killinchy areas. It is understood he was arrested after police received a number of reports of suspicious activity in the Ringhaddy area, near Killinchy.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker has praised police for their swt response to the incident and has urged people to review their home security and ensure that their front and rear doors are locked at all times.He said a suspicious car in the Grove and Kerry estates sparked alarm last Sunday with residents calling for the police who responded swtly, deploying a number of officers, including aerial support via the PSNI helicopter.ldquoI would appeal to people to ensure that their doors are locked at all times, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI would also encourage people across the district to check in with their elderly neighbours and remind them to never open their doors to strangers.ldquoPolice were swtly on the scene in Killyleagh last Sunday which was very reassuring for residents who very much appreciated the quick response, he continued.The Rowallane politician also encouraged elderly residents in particular not to open their doors to strangers.He said residents concerned about people calling at their homes should always be asked to show their ID accreditation for the organisation they claim to represent.ldquoVirtually all staff from ious organisations now carry ID cards which feature a photograph of the person carrying it. The card also includes details such as their name and, in some cases, a unique serial number.ldquoHomeowners worried about callers to their homes should also attach a chain to the inside of their front door and always ask callers to hold up their ID card to a window or put it through the letterbox so it can be checked, without having to open the door.Cllr Walker encouraged all residents to never be afraid to check a callerrsquos ID..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Roadworks.jpg","title":"Roadworks resume to extend natural gas network  ","story":"WORK continues this week on the multi-million pound scheme to expand Northern Irelandrsquos natural gas network to East Down.Phoenix Natural Gas has been working across the district for the past two years with contractors recommencing work on Monday to lay a new mains pipe in Downpatrick, the districtrsquos largest town.Work is also due to start at Lynn Doyle Place in the town and at Mill Hill in Castlewellan and Todds Hill in Saintfield as part of a district-wide poundm investment which aims to provide , customers with access to mains gas.Work on the Downpatrick scheme represents a poundm investment by the company in the town which is also linking Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Dundrum, Newcastle, Saintfield and Spa to the natural gas network.As the largest town in the extension project, Downpatrick is set to benefit from a multi-million pound investment to improve the townrsquos infrastructure and deliver the many benefits of natural gas to the area.On Monday contractors started work to provide a new mains pipe at the Ballyhornan Road, between the Knocknashinna and Ardglass road junctions.When this has been completed, contractors plan to move to nearby Edward Street where work is scheduled to last for one week.Over the coming weeks, a new mains pipe will be laid at Racecourse Hill, between the Killough Road and Stream Street junctions, with the work scheduled to last for two and a half weeks.A new mains gas pipe will also be laid at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town, between the Ardglass and Killough road junctions. Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging. It is also not without its dficulties at times due to ious factors outside the companyrsquos control.ldquoAs work continues this week and over the months ahead, it is important that people remain patient and understanding as contractors get on with the job of providing consumers with increased choice when it comes to selecting their energy provider..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Twelfth.jpg","title":"Twelfth child for Saintfield couple  ","story":"MEET the Donoghues mdash now officially the largest family in Northern Ireland.The Saintfield family entered the record books when baby daughter Molly mdash their th child mdash arrived on New Yearrsquos Day.Molly, who weighed lb oz, was born at the Ulster Hospital shortly after  noon last Wednesday.Dad Johnand mum Tessa , were thrilled to introduce little Molly to her  siblings ndash six brothers and five sisters mdash who waited excitedly to welcome her home.Saying good night in the Donoghue household sounds more like a classroom roll call.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

The industrial action involves all NHS staff, not just nurses.ldquoThere is mounting concern that NHS staff are being used as a political football to pressurise the politicians to get agreement on restoring the Assembly. It appears that we are being used as a pawn in a wider political game, but the health and care of patients should be above that.The RCN is planning more industrial action today and again this Friday, with Unison confirming that its members will not be working any overtime on Friday.ldquoOur members are the lowest paid of all in the UK, said Mr McConnell.ldquoEvery time our members take part in industrial action they are losing money. But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded. He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown. BT RAThe family wishes to place on record their sincere thanks to the doctors and nurses at Craigavon Hospital for all their care and attention to Sam during his short stay there.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2679779.jpg--.jpg?1578577862000\\","title":"suspicious package at omagh s royal mail delivery office false alarm ","story":"The Royal Mail delivery office on Omaghs High Street was evacuated for a time on Wednesday morning following the discovery of a suspicious package.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
