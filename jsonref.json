Jeff Flake, whose vote could make or break Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s Supreme Court nomination, is indicating he would vote no on the nominee unless he hears from Christine Blasey Ford          Brett Kavanaugh needs to be voted out of the Judiciary Committee before his nomination can move to the Senate floorKavanaugh needs to get through the Senate Judiciary Committee before Republican leaders can schedule a floor vote to finalize his confirmation.If Flake votes no in committee, given the Democratic opposition, it would be a tie-vote and that means Kavanaugh would not have the committee\u0027s recommendation to be confirmed.His nomination could still be brought to a vote to the Senate floor but, given the Republicans 51-seat majority, if Flake votes no again, the GOP cannot lose a single other senator if all Democrats vote no and Vice President Mike Pence would be the tie breaking vote.In 1991, Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas passed out of the Judiciary Committee on a tie 7-7 vote. He was confirmed by the entire Senate 52-48.Kavanaugh\u0027s committee vote is scheduled for Thursday although Democrats are trying to delay it. Flake is retiring from the Senate after this year - a decision he made after repeated hammering from Trump. He has been a harsh critic of the president both during the presidential campaign and since Trump took office.Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary panel, is working to schedule followup phone calls between Kavanaugh, Ford, and committee staff on both sides of the aisle. \u0027The Chairman and ranking member routinely hold bipartisan staff calls with nominees when updates are made to nominees\u0027 background files. Given the late addendum to the background file and revelations of Dr. Ford\u0027s identity, Chairman Grassley is working to set up such followup calls with Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford ahead of Thursday\u0027s scheduled vote,\u0027 he said in a statement Sunday evening. But some Democrats are grumbling a phone call may not be enough.           Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the committee may need to delay their Thursday vote          Sen. Susan Collins said she will be \u0027talking with my colleagues\u0027 about whether Thursday\u0027s committee vote should go forwardFord is willing to testify publicly and before the committee.\u0027She\u0027s willing to do whatever it takes to get her story forth, yes,\u0027 her attorney Debra Katz told NBC\u0027s \u0027Today Show\u0027 on Monday morning. Flake isn\u0027t the only Republican who wants to hear from Ford, whose bomb shell interview in The Washington Post on Sunday rocked the foundations of Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination.   Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was willing to have Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee but he wants it done before Thursday\u0027s scheduled vote.\u0027If (Christine Blasley) Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh,\u0027 Graham said in a statement on Sunday.\u0027If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford, it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled,\u0027 he added. Republican Sen. Bob Corker made a similar statement to Graham\u0027s to Politico, saying a delay \u0027would be best for all involved, including the nominee.\u0027Corker\u0027s vote is critical if Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination comes to the full Senate. Additionally, two of the other key Republican votes in the Senate are women - Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins - neither of whom face voters this year and both of whom said they are with holding judgement of Kavanaugh until after his confirmation hearing is concluded. Collins told CNN Sunday evening that she\u0027s \u0027very surprised\u0027 about the Kavanaugh allegation and \u0027it\u0027s an issue that I brought up with him last Friday and he denied\u0027 it. She said she will be \u0027talking with my colleagues\u0027 about whether Thursday\u0027s committee vote should go forward.  Murkowski says the committee \u0027might\u0027 need to consider delaying a vote on Kavanaugh.\u0027Well, I think that might be something they might have to consider, at least having that discussion,\u0027 Murkowski told CNN late Sunday night. \u0027This is not something that came up during the hearings. The hearings are now over, and if there is real substance to this, it demands a response. That may be something the committee needs to look into,\u0027 she said.     Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for Kavanaugh\u0027s Thursday\u0027s vote to be delayed          Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, left, has also called for a delay          Brett Kavanaugh is President Trump\u0027s second nominee to the Supreme CourtThe White House was hoping to pick up some Democratic votes - particularly Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota - all of whom voted for Trump\u0027s first nominee Neil Gorsuch and who face voters this fall in their home states, which the president carried in the 2016 election. All have said they are undecided.Also undecided are Democratic Senators Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both of whom are in tough re-election contests in states Trump carried in 2016. Democrats are calling for Thursday\u0027s vote to be delayed until sexual assault allegations against him can be investigated.Their revitalized push againstTrump\u0027s nominee comes after his accuser publicly identified herself as Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor in California, and offered a chilling account of a high school incident where she alleged Kavanaugh attacked her. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI should reconsider its decision and investigate before his nomination comes to a vote before the committee.\u0027From the outset, I have believed these allegations were extremely serious and bear heavily on Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s character. However, as we have seen over the past few days, hey also come at a price for the victim. I hope the attacks and shaming of her will stop and this will be treated with seriousness it deserves,\u0027 she said in a statement on Sunday.She concluded: \u0027It is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nomination.\u0027 Additionally, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has called on Grassley to postpone Thursday\u0027s vote until the allegations are investigated.\u0027Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated. For too long, when woman have made serious allegations of abuse, they have been ignored. That cannot happen in this case,\u0027 he said in a statement.\u0027To railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of America and the integrity of the Supreme Court,\u0027 he added. But so far their cries have fallen on deaf ears. \u0027I thought he might inadvertently kill me\u0027: Woman who...\u0027Interesting how quickly you got 65 names\u0027: Debra Messing...Dozens of women sign a letter defending Trump\u0027s Supreme...Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh says he had no idea the man...Share this articleA spokesperson for Grassley told The Washington Post: \u0027The vote hasn\u0027t been rescheduled.\u0027 Grassley and other Republicans have questioned the timing of the allegations, noting they have come out days before Kavanaugh is up for a vote.\u0027It\u0027s disturbing that these uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago, during high school, would surface on the even of a committee after Democrats sat on them since July,\u0027 Grassley said Sunday in a statement.He added if Feinstein and Democrats \u0027took this claim seriously, they should have brought it to the full committee\u0027s attention much earlier.\u0027He also called on Feinstein to release the letter she received that originally outlined the allegations. He concluded: \u0027It raises a lot of questions about Democrats\u0027 tactics and motives to bring hi to the rest of the committee\u0027s attention only now rather than during these many steps along he way. Senator Feinstein should publicly release the letter she received back in July so that everyone can know what she\u0027s known for weeks.\u0027The committee voted last week - before talk of an allegation against Kavanaugh became public - to vote on whether to move his nomination forward on Thursday.If Kavanaugh makes it out of committee, Republicans are aiming for a full Senate confirmation  before the Supreme Court term begins Oct. 1.          Christine Blasey Ford is going public with her allegation against Brett Kavanaugh          Christine Blasey Ford said she was worried Brett Kavanaugh might kill her during a drunken high school assault back in the 1980sBut one by one Democrats called for a delay after Ford went public with her story, saying she thought Kavanaugh might kill her during an alleged drunken high school attack.\u0027I thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u0027 said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California, to The Washington Post. \u0027He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u0027Ford described in detail how, when she was at a teenage party in the 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend followed her upstairs when she went to the bathroom and pushed her into a bedroom. She detailed how Kavanaugh alleged held her down, tried to rip off her swimsuit, and groped her.She said she escaped when his friend, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them.Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations.              Sen. Kamala Harris is one of six Democrats on the committee calling for the Kavanaugh vote o be delayed          Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he\u0027s open to having Christine Ford testifyDemocrats on Sunday praised Ford for coming forward while Republicans rushed to Kavanaugh\u0027s defense.Republicans  are expected to question Ford\u0027s memories and why Democrats sat on the accusations, sources in the White House told Politico.Additionally Trump is expected to go after Ford, those sources said.  A lawyer close to the White House told the news website Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination will not be withdrawn.\u0027No way, not even a hint of it,\u0027 the lawyer said. \u0027If anything, it\u0027s the opposite. If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something.\u0027Other Republicans point out Kavanaugh has passed numerous FBI background checks when he was White House staff secretary for George W. Bush and as a federal judge, a position that saw him confirmed by the Senate.Democrats on the Judiciary Committee offered a consistent voice on delaying the vote.Seven of the committee Democrats thus far have called for the vote to be delayed. \u0027At a bare minimum, this week\u0027s scheduled committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court must be postponed until this matter is fully and thoroughly investigated,\u0027 said Sen. Cory Booker, who\u0027s mentioned as a possible White House 2020 candidate. \u0027The Senate Judiciary Committee must now give these allegations the serious weight they deserve. They must be fully and fairly investigated. Unquestionably, the Kavanaugh confirmation vote must be delayed,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. \u0027This was a very brave step to come forward. It is more important than ever to hit the pause button on Kavanaugh\u0027s confirmation vote until we can fully investigate these serious and disturbing allegations. We cannot rush to move forward under this cloud,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. \u0027Christine Blasey Ford courageously stepped forward to tell her story — it is a credible and serious allegation. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to scrutinize SCOTUS nominees. A vote on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination must be delayed until there is a thorough investigation,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who is mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential contender.\u0027It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh. Her story is very credible \u0026amp I believe her,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Mazie  Hirono. \u0027This development is yet another reason not to rush Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination.\u0027  Christine Blasey (now Ford) and Brett Kavanaugh in their respective high school year books          Flake is casting doubt on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination \u0027I admire the courage Ms. Ford has shown in coming forward with her story. This requires a pause, at a minimum, in the unseemly, special-interest-funded rush to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Court,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.In late July, Ford sent a letter to Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo, her California congresswoman, about the high school incident. Eshoo passed the letter to Feinstein. Feinstein passed the letter to the FBI - with Ford\u0027s name redacted. The agency  declined to investigate but sent it to the White House, who passed it on to all members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u0027Upon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s background file, as per the standard process,\u0027 the FBI said.    Kavanaugh¿s accuser steps forward, putting onus on GOP - POLITICO"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/13/504BFB3F00000578-6175569-image-a-7_1537187386945.jpg","title":"Meghan cooks Grenfell","story":"    Meghan cooks with women in the Hubb Community Kitchen at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West London    Their partnership has resulted in the publications of Together: Our Community Cookbook, which features personal recipes          The Duchess of Sussex cooks with women in the Hubb Community Kitchen in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire  The duchess first visited the kitchen in January and has made a number other private trips to the centre to meet volunteers          The Duchess of Sussex plays with a young girl after cooking with women in the Hubb Community Kitchen in West London          One of the contributors to the book said she and her friends had approached Al-Manaar to ask if they could use the kitchen Revealed: How two women who cooked with Meghan were heroines...\u0027I\u0027m going to kill you, you fat f*****\u0027: Meghan Markle\u0027s...\u0027Could you bring the car round for David and Davina?\u0027:...Share this article    Some of the recipes are family favourites and all have been created by the cooks who support residents affected by the fire          The Duchess\u0027s involvement with the kitchen has resulted in the publication of Together: Our Community Cookbook  Meghan helped put the group in touch with a publisher and her Royal Foundation provided assistance with legal issues          Meghan has written the foreword to the new book produced by cooks from the Hubb Community Kitchen          The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s support of the book\u0027s publication marks her first solo project as a member of the royal family          The dishes described in the book are the women\u0027s l recipes from across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa          Some of the recipes included in the book are family favourites and all have been created by the cooks            In the introduction, the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen write that the kitchen \u0027has always been a place of good food\u0027          (From left) Hiwot Dagnachew, Aysha Bora, Halima Al-huthaifi, Ahlam Saeid and Munira Mahmud cooking in the kitchen           Intlak Al Saiegh and Ahlam Saeid cook in the Hubb Community Kitchen at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre          Halima Al-huthaifi and Ahlam Saeid enjoy the food in the Hubb Community Kitchen in West London      Halima Al-huthaifi and Zahira Ghaswala (left) and Munira Mahmud (right) in the community kitchen in West London          Food on the table in the Hubb Community Kitchen at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West London          Meghan has written the foreword to the new book produced by cooks from the Hubb Community Kitchen          The Grenfell disaster in North Kensington, West London, took place on June 14 last year and claimed the lives of 72 people        Hiwot Dagnachew (left) and Munira Mahmud (right) escaped from the Grenfell Tower infernoMeanwhile, Munira Mahmud, 34, her husband Mohammed Rasoul, 36, his father Ahmed Abdel-Rasoul, then aged 87, and their two children Mohammed, six, and 20-month-old Zahra Rasoul made their way down the stairs to the bottom of the tower to safety in June last year.The women are two of the cooks in a new book supported by the Duchess of Sussex in her first solo charity project called Together, Our Community Cookbook, which will be available in stores from Thursday priced at £9.99.Meghan – who has made secret trips to help the Hubb Community Kitchen volunteers responsible since January this year and has written the foreword – says of the kitchen: \u0027It\u0027s a place for women to laugh, cry and cook together\u0027.Ms Mekonnen – who has her aunt, one of the cooks Hiwot Dagnachew, to thank for her family surviving the tragedy, has told the Telegraph: \u0027We were fast asleep and my phone rang – I\u0027m so lucky it wasn\u0027t on silent.

I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.\u0027Word started to spread - the mums from my son\u0027s school came along and they told their friends, too.

The note to the Russian Consulate in London is dated November 30, 2010, shortly after Assange\u0027s website WikiLeaks had released a first batch of U.S. State Department filesAmong other things, the documents lay out Assange\u0027s campaign to avoid being arrested and extradited to Sweden over allegations that he sexually molested one woman and raped another during a trip to the Scandinavian country in August 2010.Assange has always denied wrongdoing in the case, which he cast as a prelude to extradition to the U.S. The Swedish prosecution jeopardized what at the time was WikiLeaks\u0027 biggest-ever disclosure: the publication of around 250,000 U.S. State Department cables. Swedish authorities issued a warrant for his arrest on November 18, just 10 days before the cables exploded across the web, with bombshell revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, American spying at the U.N. and corruption across the Arab world.Italy\u0027s then-foreign minister, Franco Frattini, described the release as the \u0027Sept. 11 of world diplomacy.\u0027 Enraged American politicians demanded that Assange be treated like a terrorist.Metadata suggests that it was on November 29, the day after the release of the first batch of U.S. State Department files, that the letter to the Russian Consulate was drafted on the Jessica Longley computer.The AP couldn\u0027t confirm whether or when the message was actually delivered, but the choice of Israel Shamir as a go-between was significant. Assange\u0027s involvement with Shamir, a fringe intellectual who once said it was the duty of every Christian and Muslim to deny the Holocaust, would draw indignation when it became public.Shamir told the AP he was plagued by memory problems and couldn\u0027t remember delivering Assange\u0027s letter or say whether he eventually got the visa on Assange\u0027s behalf.\u0027I can\u0027t possibly exclude that it happened,\u0027 Shamir said in a telephone interview. \u0027I have a very vague memory of those things.\u0027Shamir\u0027s memory appeared sharper during a January, 20, 2011 interview with Russian News Service radio - a Moscow-based station now known as Life Zvuk, or Life Sound. Shamir said he\u0027d personally brokered a Russian visa for Assange, but that it had come too late to rescue him from the sex crimes investigation.Russia \u0027would be one of those places where he and his organization would be comfortable operating,\u0027 Shamir explained. Asked if Assange had friends in the Kremlin, Shamir smiled and said: \u0027Let\u0027s hope that\u0027s the case.\u0027Shamir often makes eyebrow-raising claims (in the same interview he said that the U.S. offered Assange $100 million not to publish the cables), but it was true that any visa for Assange would have been moot.On November 30, 2010 - the date on the letter - Interpol issued a Red Notice seeking Assange\u0027s arrest, making any relocation to Russia virtually impossible. With legal bills mounting, Assange turned himself in on December 7 and his staff\u0027s focus turned to getting him out of jail. One WikiLeaks spreadsheet listed names of potential supporters arrayed by wealth and influence a second one titled \u0027Get Out of Jail Free\u0027 tracked proposed bail donations and pledges for surety.As they gathered money, Assange\u0027s allies also plotted what to do once the WikiLeaks founder was released.One document showed Guatemalan human rights lawyer Renata Avila floating the idea of jumping bail.\u0027I will advise him to seek asylum abroad: we already contacted the Ministry of Justice in Brazil, there is a possibility to run out of the country in a Brazilian ship,\u0027 Avila told fellow WikiLeaks supporters in a memo. The document said Assange should \u0027plan to escape and pay the bail money back to his supporters.\u0027Avila didn\u0027t return repeated messages seeking comment. It\u0027s not clear whether her idea went anywhere former Brazilian Justice Minister Eduardo Cardozo, who was serving on then-President-elect Dilma Rousseff\u0027s transition team at the time, told the AP that he\u0027d never heard of an Assange asylum request.Assange would eventually skip bail after exhausting his British legal campaign to block the Swedish extradition effort, darting into the Ecuadorean Embassy on June 19, 2012. The move frustrated the sex crimes prosecution, which was dropped last year, but it sparked a standoff that continues to this day, with Assange refusing to leave the embassy unless he is shielded from extradition to the U.S.Assange\u0027s escape left many of his guarantors in the lurch. When a group of them went to court in late 2012 to reduce their bill, the escape plan went unmentioned.A lawyer for four of Assange\u0027s supporters, Henry Blaxland, told the judge that Assange\u0027s Ecuadorean asylum stunt caught everyone off guard.\u0027Nobody could reasonably have foreseen that\u0027s what he would do,\u0027 Blaxland said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/23/5050579800000578-6175729-John_F_Kennedy_far_right_and_his_sister_Kathleen_Kennedy_center_-m-22_1537222717562.jpg","title":"Rare Kennedy photos inside Americas famous family","story":"In this circa 1948 photo provided by the Kennedy Family Collection, courtesy of the John F.

The new technology also laid the foundation for today\u0027s social sharing platforms such as Instagram, complete with a few amusing instances of Kennedys appearing to photobomb one another.

But I always want to see the best candidate selected. That’s what members rightly decided last night.’ But who is Dave Sharma?Who is Dave Sharma?Born Devanand Sharma in Vancouver, Canada in 1975, more commonly known as Dave, his family moved to Parramatta in Sydney a few years later, he revealed in an interview with The Indian Herald back in 2013, when he was appointed as Australia’s youngest Ambassador of Indian heritage at age 37.Sharma said that his grandfather was a Brahmin priest from the Uttar Pradesh region of India who moved to Trinidad in 1908. ‘My father was the youngest of 9 children. My father was born in 1928 in Trinidad and currently lives in Sydney. He however spends time between Trinidad, Australia and Canada.’Dave continued to explain that his ‘father did a Law Degree and he married my mother Diana who was from Sydney in 1964. They met each other in Kings College in University of London, where both of them were studying.’He also said that while a lot of his father’s family went into law, Dave was the first to embark on a career in foreign service. Studying at Turramurra High School, he achieved the highest HSC Tertiary rank of 100 in the entire state of NSW, also being the highest ranked student in NSW Public Schools that year.After studying law at the University of Cambridge, Dave went back to school to study medicine at the University of Sydney before topping it up with a Masters in International Relations from Deakin University.Before becoming Australia’s Ambassador to Israel, Dave served in the Australian diplomatic offices as Counsellor at the Australian Embassy, Third Secretary at the Australian High Commission and as Senior Civilian Adviser with the Peace Monitoring Group.Dave was also an Adviser to Foreign Minister Alexander Downer from 2004 to 2006 and was a Senior Career Officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), as well Assistant Secretary in the Africa Branch and Acting First Assistant Secretary in the International Division in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.          Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Liberal Party candidate for Wentworth Dave SharmaFollowing his appointment by Foreign Minister Bob Carr, Dave said that becoming the Ambassador of Israel was a ‘high profile posting as Israel is such an important part of the world for us. We also have a big Jewish community in Australia and have taken a close interest in this relationship.‘Indian community is a very successful migrant community in Australia and instead of concentrating on a few professions they should adopt alternate professions as well like Public Policy and join Government at the Federal level and expand their presence in non-traditional areas.‘Australia is a very open society and there are positions available for all Australians. There is meritocracy and hard work in Australia is recognised.’ He moved to Israel with his wife Rachel and their three daughters in 2013.Dave Sharma Liberal CandidateMalcolm Turnbull’s choice for his Liberal candidate won over the new Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s pick, despite calls for a woman to take up the vacant seat in Wentworth. Last week, Dave Sharman beat seven other candidates in the running for the blue ribbon electorate.Sharma will now face a by-election battle on October 20, but early polls indicate that there will be a big swing against the Liberals, who have never lost Wentworth, which includes Australia\u0027s most expensive suburbs of Point Piper and Vaucluse.This came after Morrison had already had an embarrassing episode earlier on in the day, having posted a video of Question Time edited together with Fatman Scoop’s song Be Faithful, with the caption: ‘QT was on fire today. Good work, team.’Of course, the tweet was savaged online for the song\u0027s inappropriate lyrics (\u0027who f***ing tonight?\u0027), the allusion to Liberal party member\u0027s wealth (if you\u0027ve got a hundred dollar bill put your hands up) and the possible illegality of using parliamentary footage as promotional content.Morrison removed the post hours later and apologised for using a song that’s lyrical content was \u0027not okay\u0027. In addition to this, Turnbull had been accused of attempting to tear the party that had sacked him apart.Morrison\u0027s preferred candidate Katherine O\u0027Regan, a former deputy mayor of Woollahra, received just 19 votes out of 201 in the first round and came fifth out of eight candidates, despite being the frontrunner. The other women in the preselection race: Mary-Lou Jarvis, another Woollahra councillor and rheumatologist Maxine Szramka also fared poorly against the male contenders.          Mary-Lou Jarvis (R) is seen at the Liberal Party pre-selection meeting for the seat of WentworthTo make matters worse, Mr Morrison misspelled his name as David on Twitter, despite his name being Devanand. \u0027Big congratulations to David Sharma, our new Liberal candidate for Wentworth,\u0027 he tweeted before deleting the social media message.However, Dave Sharma also received backlash after an opinion he penned for The Age in June emerged, resulting in many social media users slamming the candidate for his views. In the piece, Sharma wrote: \u0027Most school assets - the buildings and infrastructure - are used only during school hours, or roughly 15 per cent of the time. School employees and teachers are similarly underemployed, working hours closer to three-quarters of a regular full-time job.\u0027We expect government services to adapt to the tempos and demands of modern life, yet the school system remains stubbornly resistant to even the contemplation of change.\u0027And in an economy which demands increasingly high levels of skill and education, if we are to maintain our standards of living and way of life, perhaps some of the answer lies simply in more hours of education and learning.\u0027Emmys 2018: How to watch the awards onlineWho is Fan Bingbing?

Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in 2006When she got home, Allen looked at her ankle and suggested she see a doctor.After this incident, the pair began going to Knicks games together.When they began their \u0027fling,\u0027 both planned to keep it a secret and neither thought it would last.\u0027It only became a relationship really when we were thrown together because of the molestation charge,\u0027 Previn said.The comment refers to Dylan Farrow\u0027s allegations that Allen abused her in 1992 when she was seven-years-old.Allen was investigated but wasn\u0027t charged, and he has long denied inappropriately touching his adopted daughter.He faced a wave of backlash earlier this year including several prominent actors vowing not to work with him again.In a statement in January after Dylan\u0027s allegations resurfaced, Allen reiterated his denial and accused her and her family of using the Time\u0027s Up movement \u0027to repeat this discredited allegation.\u0027          Previn (pictured right, with Allen, Mia Farrow and their children in 1986) said she fell in love in 1992 with Allen, who was Farrow\u0027s boyfriend at the timeThe director is also quoted in the New York piece.\u0027I am a pariah,\u0027 he said during a lunch with the author.\u0027People think that I was Soon-Yi\u0027s father, that I raped and married my underaged, retarded daughter.\u0027He adds: \u0027We weren\u0027t thinking, My God, let\u0027s get married.\u0027Our relationship deepened as we went through the barrage of terrible accusations, and the paparazzi forced us to take walks only on my penthouse roof.\u0027Previn told the magazine that she decided to speak out now because Dylan Farrow, is, in her view, unfairly accusing her husband of sexual abusing her when she was a child.\u0027I was never interested in writing a `Mommie Dearest,\u0027 getting even with Mia - none of that,\u0027 Previn told the magazine.

(Mia) has taken advantage of the #MeToo movement and paraded Dylan as a victim. And a whole new generation is hearing about it when they shouldn\u0027t.\u0027Previn also said she and her mother clashed soon after Farrow adopted her and that her mother many times treated her like a maid.She also said of Farrow: \u0027Mia wasn\u0027t maternal to me from the get-go.\u0027An email sent to Mia Farrow\u0027s agent Sunday night was not immediately returned.In separate statements posted on Twitter on Sunday night, Dylan Farrow and Ronan Farrow say their mother is a good parent and that the New York magazine article is inaccurate and unfair.Dylan also noted that the New York magazine piece\u0027s author, Daphne Merkin, calls herself a longtime friend of Allen\u0027s."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/01/27EA303C00000578-0-image-m-31_1536883732253.jpg","title":"Coca Cola talks produce marijuana infused drinks","story":"Coca-Cola is said to be close to a deal that could see it infuse cans of soft drink with cannabisThe conglomerate is likely to use cannabidiol, known as CBD, to develop the drinks.

Until the United Scrap Lead Co. began crushing lead batteries and dumping it on 32,000 cubic yards on the land from 1948 to 1980. Eventually battery acid and rinse water contaminated water wells nearby causing the Environmental Protection Agency to declare it among the 400 highly hazardous toxic waste locations found in the country. Award-winning photographer David T. Hanson captured the image above showing the shocking site in 1985           Hanson traveled to 67 of those toxic sites in 45 states taking aerial photographs while on a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1985. Now, 33 years later Hanson is publishing a book titled Waste Land that showcases the shocking, yet captivating photographs he captured of ‘nineteenth-century mines, smelters, and wood-processing plants to landfills and illicit dumps, large petrochemical complexes, aerospace water-contamination sites, nuclear weapons plants, and nerve gas disposal areas,’ he explained to DailyMail.com. Pictured above is an image Hanson captured showing six acres next to the Delaware River in Philadelphia that was formerly the Metal Banks Site that processed transformers and oil           Hanson, who has had his work exhibited in numerous museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago, noted that he selected sites that ‘represented the broad spectrum of industries that have transformed our landscape over the past 150 years.’ Pictured above is a photo captured by Hanson showing Leadville, Colorado called the California Gulch that has been seriously impacted by lead, silver, zinc, copper, and gold mining activities          Hanson captured the image above showing one of three areas in Renton, Washington that was the proposed commercial and residential development known as Port Quendall in 1985. The area was previously an old Reilly Tar \u0026amp Chemical Co. Refinery established in the early 1900s to receive coal gas residues from the old Seattle Gas Co. plant on Lake Union. It closed in 1970 and during the investigation into the soil in 1983, it was found to contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in concentrations up to 4.8 percent - which is why it was declared toxic by the EPA          Hanson said: ‘I also thought that it was important to include a variety of sites in terms of the visibility of their environmental hazards, from dramatic mine tailings and waste ponds to sites where the hazards were invisible or concealed beneath vast industrial complexes.’ Pictured above is a photo captured by Hanson showing Anaconda, Montana with copper smelter covering 5,000 acres of land thanks to the Anaconda Co. Smelter which operated from the late 1800s to 1980           The image above that Hanson captured shows 15 acres of contaminated land in Crosby, Texas that was formerly The French Ltd. site that contains heavy metals, phenols, oil, grease, acids and solvents. The area is in the floodplain of the San Jacinto River and has been flooded on several occasions  ‘…In photographing the sites (and in my selection of the one photograph that would represent each site), I tried to utilize a range of pictorial approaches to the representation of toxic waste sites—from dramatic abstractions to mundane industrial sites, from banal commercial real estate to purely entropic landscapes.‘I was particularly interested in the possibilities of investigating abstraction and the social realities that Modernist abstraction repressed.’While traveling for a year to the Superfund hazardous waste sites, Hanson said that he was completely ‘stunned’ by the ‘enormous environmental devastation’ that he witnessed across the country.‘I quickly realized how much more visible and dramatic the destruction was from an airplane. From a highway one couldn’t see industrial waste ponds, hidden from public view, leaking in to local streams and rivers,’ he explained.‘From a country road one couldn’t know that a dirt road in the woods led to a midnight dumping site where companies were illegally dumping toxic waste in a backwoods bayou. Seeing the extent of our environmental destruction, day after day, was a very disturbing experience for me.‘I felt like I was working in a war zone.’          Pictured above is the community of Times Beach, Missouri in 1985. According to Hanson\u0027s book, \u0027in 1972 and again in 1973, the city contracted with a waste oil hauler to spray oil on unpaved roads for dust control. It was later learned that the waste oil contained dioxin. In November and early December 1982, EPA sampled the roads and right-of-ways in Times Beach. Soon afterward, the Meramec River flooded the city. EPA expedited the sample analyses and found dioxin at levels from less than 1 part per billion (ppb) to 127 ppb\u0027          While traveling for a year to the Superfund hazardous waste sites, Hanson said that he was completely ‘stunned’ by the ‘enormous environmental devastation’ that he witnessed across the country. Pictured above is Aspen, Colorado where old silver and lead mines were once active from 1879 to 1920. Little mining is conducted now, but the primary concern is the exposure to toxic metals contained in mine wastes, mill tailings and smelter by-products, according to Hanson\u0027s book Hanson decided that after witnessing and photographing the hazardous waste sites that he became involved in ‘creating more public awareness of these issues.’The Stanford University graduate has used his work for decades to promote environmental reform which helped lead the efforts for voters in the state of Montana to pass #I-137 in November 1998 which banned cyanide process open-pit gold and silver mining. It is still the only state in the country to prohibit cyanide heap-leach mining.Hanson also added that of the 67 sites he photographed in 1985 -1986, very few have been removed from the EPA’s Superfund list.‘Since 1980, only a small percentage of the total number of sites have been removed from Superfund, while most remain essentially unchanged, pending litigation, funding or environmental studies regarding feasible solutions,’ he explained.‘In reality none of these places will ever be fully reclaimed or returned to their original condition. Their “cleanup” merely amounts to emergency removal, stabilization, and long-term containment. Often the “cleanup” entails writing off the primary ecological problems as either insoluble or too expensive to consider.‘Many sites present problems for which there are no known solutions others will require years of complex remedial investigations and feasibility studies. A substantial number of sites for which solutions have been determined remain virtually untouched, awaiting the allocation of necessary clean-up funds.‘Many of the iniduals and companies responsible for the contamination have used bankruptcy laws or a variety of other legal maneuvers to avoid paying for the cleanup, thus shifting the financial burden to the American taxpayer.’           Hanson decided that after witnessing and photographing the hazardous waste sites that he became involved in ‘creating more public awareness of these issues.’ Pictured above is a portion of the 27.2-acre hazardous site in Bridgeport, New Jersey where the Bridgeport Rental \u0026amp Oil Services operated from 1969 to 1980. The site holds more than 80 tanks and process vessels, drums, tank trucks and an 11.8-acre unlined lagoon that has 50million gallons of oil, oil-water emulsions, sludge and contaminated water          Pictured above is East Helena, Montana where the Asarco primary lead and zinc smelter has emitted particulates containing metals into the air throughout its history. Hanson also added that of the 67 sites he photographed in 1985 -1986, very few have been removed from the EPA’s Superfund list.          Hanson said: ‘Since 1980, only a small percentage of the total number of sites have been removed from Superfund, while most remain essentially unchanged, pending litigation, funding or environmental studies regarding feasible solutions,’ he explained. In reality none of these places will ever be fully reclaimed or returned to their original condition. Their “cleanup” merely amounts to emergency removal, stabilization, and long-term containment. Often the “cleanup” entails writing off the primary ecological problems as either insoluble or too expensive to consider.\u0027 Pictured above is six acres in Utica, Michigan where the site contains an incinerator for liquid wastes, various industrial liquids and sludges in two lagoonsHanson said the problems are ‘getting worse’ and the ‘EPA is increasing relaxing its regulations on industrial pollution.’He also added that he has ‘grave concerns about the substantive cleanup of Superfund sites as well as the other toxic sites’ across the country. As an example, Hanson explained that what he considers the most dangerous Superfund site, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Rocky Flats Plant near Denver in Golden, Colorado, ‘manufactured the plutonium cores for the nuclear and thermonuclear weapons produced in the United States.’‘In 1996 the DOE estimated that the total cleanup costs for Rocky Flats would be $100 billion. Yet in 2005 the DOE declared that it had completed the cleanup of Rocky Flats for a cost of only $7 billion (although the industrial core of Rocky Flats remains a high-security site whose extensive environmental hazards have not yet been addressed),’ he explained.‘5,600 acres surrounding the weapons plants had been established in 2001 as the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, to be managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in spite of the fact that this land had been heavily contaminated with plutonium over the course of forty years from extensive dumping and more than 200 plutonium fires at the plant.            Hanson said the problems are ‘getting worse’ and the ‘EPA is increasing relaxing its regulations on industrial pollution.’ Pictured above is the Pocatello, Idaho where Hanson photographed the Union Pacific Railroad Co. site where sludge from its oilwater separation plant was dumped into what appears to be a 150-foot by 40-foot unlined man-made pond           Pictured above in the image Hanson captured is Fresno County, California where the Atlas Asbestos Mine operated from 1963 to 1980 on a 16-acre site about 19miles northwest of Coalingo. The abandoned site consists of the asbestos mine, a processing mill, support buildings, and extensive asbestos tailings. Drainage from the site is directly downslope into White Creek, then into Los Gatos Creek. Los Gatos Creek is a tributary to the Arroyo Pasajero, a flood area along the California Aqueduct, according to Hanson\u0027s book           Pictured above in the image Hanson captured is the Martin-Marietta Aluminum Co. produces aluminum on a site covering less than 350 acres in The Dalles, Wasco County, Oregon. Cyanide is present in both the shallow and deep aquifers underlying the site, according to tests conducted by the State and Martin-Marietta. Cyanide appeared in one production well and several monitoring wells, and also in surface run-off and in leachate from a cathode waste pile, according to Hanson\u0027s book           Pictured above is Scotlandville, Louisiana where 55 acres of land was used by the Petro-Processors. It was found by the EPA that toxic organic compounds and heavy metals had been released into local waterways, eventually finding their way to the Mississippi River, and were posing a threat to an underground drinking water supply, according to Hanson\u0027s book‘In 1975-76 a DOE contractor had found 100 billion particles of plutonium per acre on the land that is now a “wildlife refuge” and is currently about to be opened to the public.’He added that plutonium is radioactive and highly flammable and that believes it to be one of the most toxic substances produced by humans.Though the images in Hanson’s book were captured 33 years ago, they are even more relevant today ‘given our growing concerns about energy production, environmental degradation, and climate change—and given the current Administration’s broad dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental regulations, and Superfund,’ he noted.His book can be purchased beginning September 25 and can be found here.          Though the images in Hanson’s book were captured 33 years ago, they are even more relevant today ‘given our growing concerns about energy production, environmental degradation, and climate change—and given the current Administration’s broad dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental regulations, and Superfund,’ he noted. Pictured above is his book cover showing The Silver Bow Creek site in Montana that has been contaminated with a variety of wastes received from industrial, agricultural, and municipal activities for over 100 years. Contaminants such as heavy metals and phosphates were detected in the creek, which was used for drinking, irrigation, and recreation at the time"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/20/504FFF0100000578-6177743-image-a-3_1537213368256.jpg","title":"Female security guard seen running tight ship Wilmington grocery store","story":"    Footage obtained by DailyMail.com shows security guard Chieka Corso single-handedly keeping scores customers in line as they wait to get into Harris Teeter supermarket in Wilmington, North Carolina           Corso, 38, has worked as a security guard at the store for four years and her shtick has made it so that no cops have been called there, unlike other stores and restaurants in the area           People wait in line to buy food and supplies at one of the few places open in Wilmington North Carolina after Hurricane Florence traveled through the area Sunday\u0027If you get out of line and you\u0027re the only person in that line, you get out, you get to the back.

In past hurricanes, flooding at dozens of farms also left hundreds of thousands of dead hogs, chickens and other decomposing livestock bobbing in floodwaters.Some stream gauges used to monitor river levels failed when they became submerged, but others showed water levels rising steadily, with forecasts calling for rivers to at or near record levels. The Defense Department said about 13,500 military personnel were assigned to help relief efforts.Authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of up to 7,500 people living within a mile of a stretch of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, about 100 miles from the North Carolina coast. The evacuation zone included part of the city of Fayetteville, population 200,000.Near the flooded-out town of New Bern , where about 455 people had to be rescued from the swirling flood waters, water completely surrounded churches, businesses and homes. In the neighboring town of Trenton, downtown streets were turned to creeks full of brown water.The rain was unrelenting in Cheraw, a town of about 6,000 people in northeastern South Carolina.

To lose it would be a calamity - and a betrayal by our ministers Commentary by Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail The idea that a firm as prestigious and influential as Unilever, with a British heritage dating back to its foundation at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in the late 19th century, should be proposing to leave these shores is a terrible shock.Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UK.The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next month.          Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UKIf the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companies.The rules of many UK pension funds require that they only invest in UK-quoted companies for reasons of prudence, accountability and governance.Not surprisingly, one of the country’s biggest investors, the insurer Aviva, is rightly crying foul over the idea of Unilever’s move – arguing that the firm would no longer be a British company.Aviva’s chief investment officer, David Cumming, told the Financial Times: ‘We are not supportive and will vote against it. It doesn’t add any value for us and we lose quite a large company from the index. We don’t see any justification for the move.’          The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next monthThe reason Unilever wants to rebase in the Netherlands is founded on its bruising experience last year when it was subject of a £110billion takeover bid, which ultimately failed.In what would have been the second largest corporate deal in history, US giant Kraft Heinz (backed by private equity firms and the support one of the world’s richest men, Warren Buffett) launched an unsolicited bid for the maker of countless household names such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.Unilever’s Dutch chief executive, Paul Polman, a staunch advocate of ethical capitalism, fought off the bid and vowed to protect Unilever’s golden heritage from predators.To try to guarantee this and prevent any future raids, it was felt that the firm’s Anglo-Dutch structure, with share quotations, boards and headquarters in both Britain and Holland, should be simplified. This, management feels, is best achieved by a switch to Rotterdam.          If the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companiesThe intention is that Unilever will follow Royal Dutch Shell and the publishing and media colossus Reed Elsevier (now renamed Relx) which both separately decided to unify their shares under one umbrella while keeping share quotations in London as part of the FTSE 100 index.But Unilever wants to go one step further by coming out of the FTSE 100, claiming that it has more major Dutch than British investors. The truth is that the British Establishment’s reaction has been pathetic.It has shown monumental weakness and done nothing to ensure that Unilever stays here, while the Dutch government has done all in its power to encourage the move.A juicy carrot offered to Unilever chiefs by the Netherlands is the abolition of a measure that forces companies to pay the tax on idends distributed to shareholders upfront. This brings the Dutch system into line with the UK, which did the same several years ago as part of a successful effort to simplify our tax structure and make Britain the most attractive location for inward investment from overseas in Europe.          Prince Harry with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (right) and Paul Polman (left), CEO of Unilever backstage at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Annual Awards Dinner Honoring HRH Prince Harry at Ritz Carlton Hotel in Washington, DCThis tax change may have been the decisive factor for a Dutch-dominated board of directors. But there can be no doubt that their planned move to Rotterdam has been influenced by the Government’s woeful recent record at defending British companies against foreign predators.It’s a tragic truth that Britain has been allowed to become the most open market in the world to overseas takeovers – often with disastrous consequences for our national interests.For example, the £11.5billion takeover of Cadbury by Kraft led to the chocolate giant’s headquarters closing, its tax domicile switching from Britain to low-tax Switzerland and the unpopular meddling with the size, ingredients and taste of emblematic brands, including the Creme Egg.Other leading British brands have also been sold off, such as Costa Coffee being taken over by Coca-Cola, a company that has been heavily criticised for tax avoidance.By contrast, the Dutch authorities are much more protective against foreign takeovers.Last year, the chemical and paint giant Akzo Nobel (the owner of Britain’s Dulux brand) defended itself against a hostile bid by garnering the support of works councils, which have a key role in such takeover talks, as well as using provisions in Dutch competition law. Indeed, there is a clear view among analysts and some shareholders that the real purpose of Unilever’s proposal to move its domicile is to give itself maximum protection from any future bids for the group or attempts to force it to demerge any of its major brands.Aside from any other considerations, I am convinced that the decision to migrate from Britain makes no commercial sense.The fastest growing part of Unilever’s erse business involves beauty brands such as Dove and household products including Persil. There seems to be an insatiable demand for them from emerging economies in Asia and Latin America. The brains behind these best-sellers would remain in the UK because they are expected to make up 75 per cent of global sales, while the teams behind Unilever’s ice cream range Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and lesser products such as Lipton tea will be working in Holland.Whatever the management thinks, the major restructuring decision to separate the share quotation base and domicile from the home of the company’s main business is irrational.Inevitably, too, there are bound to be profound concerns that the Treasury could lose millions of pounds of corporate taxes from Unilever as a result of a switch to Rotterdam.Significantly, Holland has a reputation as a home for tax avoidance, with laws that offer a shield from taxation on profits.Such enticements have lured firms including Starbucks, Google and IBM to set up offices, while the Rolling Stones and U2, too, have taken advantage of Dutch tax shelters.Of course, there has been a widespread suspicion that Unilever’s break from the FTSE 100 is being done as a protective measure in case trading conditions suffer as a result of Brexit.However, my conversations with Unilever executives do not lead me to think this is a major issue, although it may be preying on the minds of Dutch shareholders and bosses driving the process.Even so, I am utterly convinced that if Unilever leaves Britain, the company will do itself great damage.Its shares would be less attractive to both overseas and British investors who value Anglo-Saxon capitalism, the weight of financial expertise in Britain and access to the strongest capital markets in Europe.With Britain’s national interest at stake, is it beyond hope that the Government might finally wake up to the huge potential cost to this country’s economy of what would be a calamitous decision for a company as important as Unilever to move its HQ abroad? "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/16/504D69A600000578-0-image-m-59_1537198254203.jpg","title":"Derbyshire dog owner returns holiday Croatia news Staffordshire terrier down","story":"    Staffordshire bull terrier, Blue, was put down by kennel staff while his owner was on holidayMr Hall, who suffers from depression, said Blue was helping him to tackle his mental health issues.The father-of-four was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 and had to tell his children that their beloved pet had gone to \u0027doggy heaven\u0027.He said: \u0027Blue didn\u0027t have a violent bone in his body.

Mr Hall\u0027s neighbour had taken Blue for a walk when the dog ran away and was captured by wardens\u0027As we were unable to reunite the dog with its owner, he was taken to kennels. Stray dogs are cared for in kennels for seven days, after which point, they are legally owned by Derby City Council.\u0027Our kennels received no contact from the friend or owner, and there was no report of this dog being lost.\u0027The dog showed signs of aggression to the kennel owner and kennel staff, so after the seven days had passed, and no contact had been received, we had to take the difficult decision to put the dog to sleep.\u0027Dogs who show aggression and cannot safely be adopted or rehomed are, where appropriate, put to sleep.\u0027We do not take that decision lightly, and would only ever decide to put a dog to sleep if it was deemed absolutely necessary.\u0027Had the kennels received information or were contacted to state that the owners were on holiday then the dog would of course have remained in kennels to allow the owners to come forward.

Failing to meet responsibilities, causing harm to others and the potential loss of respectability could be a better message for older adults to cut their drinking.Gender also played a role in what was considered acceptable drinking, with drunk women viewed more negatively than men.Mrs Muhlack, whose study was published in the BMC Public Health journal, said: \u0027It is surprising that health does not strongly factor in the way this group thinks about their drinking. When they do think about health they use their own experiences as a benchmark, for example what it feels like when you drink too much, rather than guidelines.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/27/16/4F70A0C700000578-0-image-a-5_1535384675015.jpg","title":"BMW reveal iNext new electric driverless SUV interactive seats","story":"    BMW has revealed its new electric, driverless SUV that comes kitted out with a number of James Bond-style gadgets          Due to be released in 2021 as a production car, the Vision iNext features revolutionary ideas including \u0027interactive seats\u0027          The 4x4 has suicide doors, a seemingly transparent panoramic roof and very slim strips for headlights and taillights          \u0027Suicide doors\u0027 is the slang term for car doors hinged at the rear rather than the front.

The girls were so heavy.\u0027Just as they were about to open an emergency fire exit a firefighter screamed at them to stop because that side of the building above was on fire. Ms Mekonnen couldn\u0027t even finish her sentence as she wonders aloud: \u0027If he hadn\u0027t… I can\u0027t believe we are alive.\u0027Ms Mahmud\u0027s husband Mohammed has admitted he often \u0027thinks back\u0027 to that night when it took them all about 15 minutes to get to the bottom floor with his elderly father, telling GetWestLondon: \u0027I thank God we got out early and we made it.\u0027He revealed that his wife\u0027s best friend and his children\u0027s friends passed away, as well as his friend\u0027s mother.He said of his friend: \u0027Me and him, we had both been in the tower since birth.\u0027He told how all their closest friends were there and how he \u0027prays\u0027 that they\u0027re going to be \u0027reunited\u0027 with them one day.             Meghan poses with women at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West LondonMs Mahmud wrote of her involvement with the book: \u0027Last summer, we were placed in a hotel and I had no kitchen to cook for my family.\u0027It was very emotional for me to get in the kitchen. The moment I started cooking I was in tears. I didn\u0027t know why though. I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.\u0027Word started to spread - the mums from my son\u0027s school came along and they told their friends, too. Soon there were women from different cultures all cooking, swapping recipes, talking and laughing together.\u0027She told how Meghan - photographed on the book\u0027s front cover helping out - had been happy to pitch in, continuing: \u0027She wore an apron. I can\u0027t believe I made her wash rice!\u0027After the duchess found out that we could only use the kitchen twice a week due to funding, she mentioned, \u0027How about sharing your recipes with other people?\u0027Ms Mahmud added: \u0027And that\u0027s how it happened.\u0027 TOGETHER: Our Community Cookbook: Amazon.co.uk: The Hubb Community Kitchen, HRH The Duchess of Sussex: 9781529102925: BooksTOGETHER: Our Community Cookbook: Amazon.co.uk: The Hubb Community Kitchen, HRH The Duchess of Sussex: 9781529102925: Books"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/20/504552E300000578-0-image-a-16_1537127327461.jpg","title":"Dreadlocked dog saved abandoned matted barely walk","story":"    A mistreated dog covered with 4lbs of matted hair so thick that it couldn\u0027t move properly has been rescued from its alcoholic owner in Poland          Police and firefighters saved the animal after concerned locals in the city of Lodz called to report the owner          The dog lost half its body weight when the hair was shaved away and has now been named Farciarz, which means \u0027lucky\u0027 in Polish.Rescuers have now renamed the dog Farciarz, which means \u0027lucky\u0027 in Polish.Officers say the dog was left to fend for itself for some time, though other than the matted fur it was uninjured.Breathtaking moment three humpbacks soar into the sky in an...It\u0027s a flock of tea-gulls!

The note to the Russian Consulate in London is dated November 30, 2010, shortly after Assange\u0027s website WikiLeaks had released a first batch of U.S. State Department filesAmong other things, the documents lay out Assange\u0027s campaign to avoid being arrested and extradited to Sweden over allegations that he sexually molested one woman and raped another during a trip to the Scandinavian country in August 2010.Assange has always denied wrongdoing in the case, which he cast as a prelude to extradition to the U.S. The Swedish prosecution jeopardized what at the time was WikiLeaks\u0027 biggest-ever disclosure: the publication of around 250,000 U.S. State Department cables. Swedish authorities issued a warrant for his arrest on November 18, just 10 days before the cables exploded across the web, with bombshell revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, American spying at the U.N. and corruption across the Arab world.Italy\u0027s then-foreign minister, Franco Frattini, described the release as the \u0027Sept. 11 of world diplomacy.\u0027 Enraged American politicians demanded that Assange be treated like a terrorist.Metadata suggests that it was on November 29, the day after the release of the first batch of U.S. State Department files, that the letter to the Russian Consulate was drafted on the Jessica Longley computer.The AP couldn\u0027t confirm whether or when the message was actually delivered, but the choice of Israel Shamir as a go-between was significant. Assange\u0027s involvement with Shamir, a fringe intellectual who once said it was the duty of every Christian and Muslim to deny the Holocaust, would draw indignation when it became public.Shamir told the AP he was plagued by memory problems and couldn\u0027t remember delivering Assange\u0027s letter or say whether he eventually got the visa on Assange\u0027s behalf.\u0027I can\u0027t possibly exclude that it happened,\u0027 Shamir said in a telephone interview. \u0027I have a very vague memory of those things.\u0027Shamir\u0027s memory appeared sharper during a January, 20, 2011 interview with Russian News Service radio - a Moscow-based station now known as Life Zvuk, or Life Sound. Shamir said he\u0027d personally brokered a Russian visa for Assange, but that it had come too late to rescue him from the sex crimes investigation.Russia \u0027would be one of those places where he and his organization would be comfortable operating,\u0027 Shamir explained. Asked if Assange had friends in the Kremlin, Shamir smiled and said: \u0027Let\u0027s hope that\u0027s the case.\u0027Shamir often makes eyebrow-raising claims (in the same interview he said that the U.S. offered Assange $100 million not to publish the cables), but it was true that any visa for Assange would have been moot.On November 30, 2010 - the date on the letter - Interpol issued a Red Notice seeking Assange\u0027s arrest, making any relocation to Russia virtually impossible. With legal bills mounting, Assange turned himself in on December 7 and his staff\u0027s focus turned to getting him out of jail. One WikiLeaks spreadsheet listed names of potential supporters arrayed by wealth and influence a second one titled \u0027Get Out of Jail Free\u0027 tracked proposed bail donations and pledges for surety.As they gathered money, Assange\u0027s allies also plotted what to do once the WikiLeaks founder was released.One document showed Guatemalan human rights lawyer Renata Avila floating the idea of jumping bail.\u0027I will advise him to seek asylum abroad: we already contacted the Ministry of Justice in Brazil, there is a possibility to run out of the country in a Brazilian ship,\u0027 Avila told fellow WikiLeaks supporters in a memo. The document said Assange should \u0027plan to escape and pay the bail money back to his supporters.\u0027Avila didn\u0027t return repeated messages seeking comment. It\u0027s not clear whether her idea went anywhere former Brazilian Justice Minister Eduardo Cardozo, who was serving on then-President-elect Dilma Rousseff\u0027s transition team at the time, told the AP that he\u0027d never heard of an Assange asylum request.Assange would eventually skip bail after exhausting his British legal campaign to block the Swedish extradition effort, darting into the Ecuadorean Embassy on June 19, 2012. The move frustrated the sex crimes prosecution, which was dropped last year, but it sparked a standoff that continues to this day, with Assange refusing to leave the embassy unless he is shielded from extradition to the U.S.Assange\u0027s escape left many of his guarantors in the lurch. When a group of them went to court in late 2012 to reduce their bill, the escape plan went unmentioned.A lawyer for four of Assange\u0027s supporters, Henry Blaxland, told the judge that Assange\u0027s Ecuadorean asylum stunt caught everyone off guard.\u0027Nobody could reasonably have foreseen that\u0027s what he would do,\u0027 Blaxland said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/23/5050579800000578-6175729-John_F_Kennedy_far_right_and_his_sister_Kathleen_Kennedy_center_-m-22_1537222717562.jpg","title":"Rare Kennedy photos inside Americas famous family","story":"In this circa 1948 photo provided by the Kennedy Family Collection, courtesy of the John F.

The new technology also laid the foundation for today\u0027s social sharing platforms such as Instagram, complete with a few amusing instances of Kennedys appearing to photobomb one another.

Miss Stockden lost her driving licence on a night out in 2015 and unluckily for her it was found by Boyce who kept itBoyce was arrested and interviewed and continued to insist that Miss Stockden was the driver and she was his ex-girlfriend.Police questioned Miss Stockden several times.Miss Stockden said: \u0027When I got the letter I realised the licence plate wasn\u0027t mine and thought that was the end of it.\u0027Then a couple of weeks later I was asked to give a statement because the case had escalated.

He said he wanted to say sorry and then admitted who he was.Boyce, from Bournemouth, was handed a 13-month suspended prison sentence and a six-month tagged curfew.He was also ordered to carry out 270 hours of unpaid work, told to pay a victim surcharge of £140 and disqualified from driving for six months.Boyce also received a two-year conditional discharge for a second fraud offence, which occurred in London.Speaking after the case PC Sean Todd, of Dorset police, said: \u0027Muhammad Boyce stole an innocent women\u0027s identity in an attempt to get out of a speeding offence. \u0027Even after he was challenged by officers he continued to spin a web of lies to evade justice.\u0027I hope the conclusion of this case will give the victim some sense of closure after what has been a very stressful time for her.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/13/504C1B4900000578-6176095-image-m-21_1537187394217.jpg","title":"Shocking photos rubbish collected British beach","story":"    Penny Miners, from Cornwall, was so shocked by the sheer amount of litter she found on Praa Sands beach (above) that she took a photo of her growing collection every day for a month  Penny believes most of the rubbish came from holidaymakers, saying: \u0027The next day, once they\u0027d all gone home, it had stopped\u0027          \u0027It\u0027s addictive\u0027: Penny explained that she finds picking up bags of rubbish rewarding because there is the possibility it may save an animal\u0027s lifeShe said: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t like to say it was all holidaymakers but on the last Friday of the holiday I removed a load of rubbish.\u0027The next day, once they\u0027d all gone home, it had stopped.

Until the United Scrap Lead Co. began crushing lead batteries and dumping it on 32,000 cubic yards on the land from 1948 to 1980. Eventually battery acid and rinse water contaminated water wells nearby causing the Environmental Protection Agency to declare it among the 400 highly hazardous toxic waste locations found in the country. Award-winning photographer David T. Hanson captured the image above showing the shocking site in 1985           Hanson traveled to 67 of those toxic sites in 45 states taking aerial photographs while on a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1985. Now, 33 years later Hanson is publishing a book titled Waste Land that showcases the shocking, yet captivating photographs he captured of ‘nineteenth-century mines, smelters, and wood-processing plants to landfills and illicit dumps, large petrochemical complexes, aerospace water-contamination sites, nuclear weapons plants, and nerve gas disposal areas,’ he explained to DailyMail.com. Pictured above is an image Hanson captured showing six acres next to the Delaware River in Philadelphia that was formerly the Metal Banks Site that processed transformers and oil           Hanson, who has had his work exhibited in numerous museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago, noted that he selected sites that ‘represented the broad spectrum of industries that have transformed our landscape over the past 150 years.’ Pictured above is a photo captured by Hanson showing Leadville, Colorado called the California Gulch that has been seriously impacted by lead, silver, zinc, copper, and gold mining activities          Hanson captured the image above showing one of three areas in Renton, Washington that was the proposed commercial and residential development known as Port Quendall in 1985. The area was previously an old Reilly Tar \u0026amp Chemical Co. Refinery established in the early 1900s to receive coal gas residues from the old Seattle Gas Co. plant on Lake Union. It closed in 1970 and during the investigation into the soil in 1983, it was found to contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in concentrations up to 4.8 percent - which is why it was declared toxic by the EPA          Hanson said: ‘I also thought that it was important to include a variety of sites in terms of the visibility of their environmental hazards, from dramatic mine tailings and waste ponds to sites where the hazards were invisible or concealed beneath vast industrial complexes.’ Pictured above is a photo captured by Hanson showing Anaconda, Montana with copper smelter covering 5,000 acres of land thanks to the Anaconda Co. Smelter which operated from the late 1800s to 1980           The image above that Hanson captured shows 15 acres of contaminated land in Crosby, Texas that was formerly The French Ltd. site that contains heavy metals, phenols, oil, grease, acids and solvents. The area is in the floodplain of the San Jacinto River and has been flooded on several occasions  ‘…In photographing the sites (and in my selection of the one photograph that would represent each site), I tried to utilize a range of pictorial approaches to the representation of toxic waste sites—from dramatic abstractions to mundane industrial sites, from banal commercial real estate to purely entropic landscapes.‘I was particularly interested in the possibilities of investigating abstraction and the social realities that Modernist abstraction repressed.’While traveling for a year to the Superfund hazardous waste sites, Hanson said that he was completely ‘stunned’ by the ‘enormous environmental devastation’ that he witnessed across the country.‘I quickly realized how much more visible and dramatic the destruction was from an airplane. From a highway one couldn’t see industrial waste ponds, hidden from public view, leaking in to local streams and rivers,’ he explained.‘From a country road one couldn’t know that a dirt road in the woods led to a midnight dumping site where companies were illegally dumping toxic waste in a backwoods bayou. Seeing the extent of our environmental destruction, day after day, was a very disturbing experience for me.‘I felt like I was working in a war zone.’          Pictured above is the community of Times Beach, Missouri in 1985. According to Hanson\u0027s book, \u0027in 1972 and again in 1973, the city contracted with a waste oil hauler to spray oil on unpaved roads for dust control. It was later learned that the waste oil contained dioxin. In November and early December 1982, EPA sampled the roads and right-of-ways in Times Beach. Soon afterward, the Meramec River flooded the city. EPA expedited the sample analyses and found dioxin at levels from less than 1 part per billion (ppb) to 127 ppb\u0027          While traveling for a year to the Superfund hazardous waste sites, Hanson said that he was completely ‘stunned’ by the ‘enormous environmental devastation’ that he witnessed across the country. Pictured above is Aspen, Colorado where old silver and lead mines were once active from 1879 to 1920. Little mining is conducted now, but the primary concern is the exposure to toxic metals contained in mine wastes, mill tailings and smelter by-products, according to Hanson\u0027s book Hanson decided that after witnessing and photographing the hazardous waste sites that he became involved in ‘creating more public awareness of these issues.’The Stanford University graduate has used his work for decades to promote environmental reform which helped lead the efforts for voters in the state of Montana to pass #I-137 in November 1998 which banned cyanide process open-pit gold and silver mining. It is still the only state in the country to prohibit cyanide heap-leach mining.Hanson also added that of the 67 sites he photographed in 1985 -1986, very few have been removed from the EPA’s Superfund list.‘Since 1980, only a small percentage of the total number of sites have been removed from Superfund, while most remain essentially unchanged, pending litigation, funding or environmental studies regarding feasible solutions,’ he explained.‘In reality none of these places will ever be fully reclaimed or returned to their original condition. Their “cleanup” merely amounts to emergency removal, stabilization, and long-term containment. Often the “cleanup” entails writing off the primary ecological problems as either insoluble or too expensive to consider.‘Many sites present problems for which there are no known solutions others will require years of complex remedial investigations and feasibility studies. A substantial number of sites for which solutions have been determined remain virtually untouched, awaiting the allocation of necessary clean-up funds.‘Many of the iniduals and companies responsible for the contamination have used bankruptcy laws or a variety of other legal maneuvers to avoid paying for the cleanup, thus shifting the financial burden to the American taxpayer.’           Hanson decided that after witnessing and photographing the hazardous waste sites that he became involved in ‘creating more public awareness of these issues.’ Pictured above is a portion of the 27.2-acre hazardous site in Bridgeport, New Jersey where the Bridgeport Rental \u0026amp Oil Services operated from 1969 to 1980. The site holds more than 80 tanks and process vessels, drums, tank trucks and an 11.8-acre unlined lagoon that has 50million gallons of oil, oil-water emulsions, sludge and contaminated water          Pictured above is East Helena, Montana where the Asarco primary lead and zinc smelter has emitted particulates containing metals into the air throughout its history. Hanson also added that of the 67 sites he photographed in 1985 -1986, very few have been removed from the EPA’s Superfund list.          Hanson said: ‘Since 1980, only a small percentage of the total number of sites have been removed from Superfund, while most remain essentially unchanged, pending litigation, funding or environmental studies regarding feasible solutions,’ he explained. In reality none of these places will ever be fully reclaimed or returned to their original condition. Their “cleanup” merely amounts to emergency removal, stabilization, and long-term containment. Often the “cleanup” entails writing off the primary ecological problems as either insoluble or too expensive to consider.\u0027 Pictured above is six acres in Utica, Michigan where the site contains an incinerator for liquid wastes, various industrial liquids and sludges in two lagoonsHanson said the problems are ‘getting worse’ and the ‘EPA is increasing relaxing its regulations on industrial pollution.’He also added that he has ‘grave concerns about the substantive cleanup of Superfund sites as well as the other toxic sites’ across the country. As an example, Hanson explained that what he considers the most dangerous Superfund site, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Rocky Flats Plant near Denver in Golden, Colorado, ‘manufactured the plutonium cores for the nuclear and thermonuclear weapons produced in the United States.’‘In 1996 the DOE estimated that the total cleanup costs for Rocky Flats would be $100 billion. Yet in 2005 the DOE declared that it had completed the cleanup of Rocky Flats for a cost of only $7 billion (although the industrial core of Rocky Flats remains a high-security site whose extensive environmental hazards have not yet been addressed),’ he explained.‘5,600 acres surrounding the weapons plants had been established in 2001 as the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, to be managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in spite of the fact that this land had been heavily contaminated with plutonium over the course of forty years from extensive dumping and more than 200 plutonium fires at the plant.            Hanson said the problems are ‘getting worse’ and the ‘EPA is increasing relaxing its regulations on industrial pollution.’ Pictured above is the Pocatello, Idaho where Hanson photographed the Union Pacific Railroad Co. site where sludge from its oilwater separation plant was dumped into what appears to be a 150-foot by 40-foot unlined man-made pond           Pictured above in the image Hanson captured is Fresno County, California where the Atlas Asbestos Mine operated from 1963 to 1980 on a 16-acre site about 19miles northwest of Coalingo. The abandoned site consists of the asbestos mine, a processing mill, support buildings, and extensive asbestos tailings. Drainage from the site is directly downslope into White Creek, then into Los Gatos Creek. Los Gatos Creek is a tributary to the Arroyo Pasajero, a flood area along the California Aqueduct, according to Hanson\u0027s book           Pictured above in the image Hanson captured is the Martin-Marietta Aluminum Co. produces aluminum on a site covering less than 350 acres in The Dalles, Wasco County, Oregon. Cyanide is present in both the shallow and deep aquifers underlying the site, according to tests conducted by the State and Martin-Marietta. Cyanide appeared in one production well and several monitoring wells, and also in surface run-off and in leachate from a cathode waste pile, according to Hanson\u0027s book           Pictured above is Scotlandville, Louisiana where 55 acres of land was used by the Petro-Processors. It was found by the EPA that toxic organic compounds and heavy metals had been released into local waterways, eventually finding their way to the Mississippi River, and were posing a threat to an underground drinking water supply, according to Hanson\u0027s book‘In 1975-76 a DOE contractor had found 100 billion particles of plutonium per acre on the land that is now a “wildlife refuge” and is currently about to be opened to the public.’He added that plutonium is radioactive and highly flammable and that believes it to be one of the most toxic substances produced by humans.Though the images in Hanson’s book were captured 33 years ago, they are even more relevant today ‘given our growing concerns about energy production, environmental degradation, and climate change—and given the current Administration’s broad dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental regulations, and Superfund,’ he noted.His book can be purchased beginning September 25 and can be found here.          Though the images in Hanson’s book were captured 33 years ago, they are even more relevant today ‘given our growing concerns about energy production, environmental degradation, and climate change—and given the current Administration’s broad dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental regulations, and Superfund,’ he noted. Pictured above is his book cover showing The Silver Bow Creek site in Montana that has been contaminated with a variety of wastes received from industrial, agricultural, and municipal activities for over 100 years. Contaminants such as heavy metals and phosphates were detected in the creek, which was used for drinking, irrigation, and recreation at the time"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/20/504FFF0100000578-6177743-image-a-3_1537213368256.jpg","title":"Female security guard seen running tight ship Wilmington grocery store","story":"    Footage obtained by DailyMail.com shows security guard Chieka Corso single-handedly keeping scores customers in line as they wait to get into Harris Teeter supermarket in Wilmington, North Carolina           Corso, 38, has worked as a security guard at the store for four years and her shtick has made it so that no cops have been called there, unlike other stores and restaurants in the area           People wait in line to buy food and supplies at one of the few places open in Wilmington North Carolina after Hurricane Florence traveled through the area Sunday\u0027If you get out of line and you\u0027re the only person in that line, you get out, you get to the back.

In past hurricanes, flooding at dozens of farms also left hundreds of thousands of dead hogs, chickens and other decomposing livestock bobbing in floodwaters.Some stream gauges used to monitor river levels failed when they became submerged, but others showed water levels rising steadily, with forecasts calling for rivers to at or near record levels. The Defense Department said about 13,500 military personnel were assigned to help relief efforts.Authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of up to 7,500 people living within a mile of a stretch of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, about 100 miles from the North Carolina coast. The evacuation zone included part of the city of Fayetteville, population 200,000.Near the flooded-out town of New Bern , where about 455 people had to be rescued from the swirling flood waters, water completely surrounded churches, businesses and homes. In the neighboring town of Trenton, downtown streets were turned to creeks full of brown water.The rain was unrelenting in Cheraw, a town of about 6,000 people in northeastern South Carolina.

To lose it would be a calamity - and a betrayal by our ministers Commentary by Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail The idea that a firm as prestigious and influential as Unilever, with a British heritage dating back to its foundation at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in the late 19th century, should be proposing to leave these shores is a terrible shock.Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UK.The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next month.          Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UKIf the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companies.The rules of many UK pension funds require that they only invest in UK-quoted companies for reasons of prudence, accountability and governance.Not surprisingly, one of the country’s biggest investors, the insurer Aviva, is rightly crying foul over the idea of Unilever’s move – arguing that the firm would no longer be a British company.Aviva’s chief investment officer, David Cumming, told the Financial Times: ‘We are not supportive and will vote against it. It doesn’t add any value for us and we lose quite a large company from the index. We don’t see any justification for the move.’          The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next monthThe reason Unilever wants to rebase in the Netherlands is founded on its bruising experience last year when it was subject of a £110billion takeover bid, which ultimately failed.In what would have been the second largest corporate deal in history, US giant Kraft Heinz (backed by private equity firms and the support one of the world’s richest men, Warren Buffett) launched an unsolicited bid for the maker of countless household names such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.Unilever’s Dutch chief executive, Paul Polman, a staunch advocate of ethical capitalism, fought off the bid and vowed to protect Unilever’s golden heritage from predators.To try to guarantee this and prevent any future raids, it was felt that the firm’s Anglo-Dutch structure, with share quotations, boards and headquarters in both Britain and Holland, should be simplified. This, management feels, is best achieved by a switch to Rotterdam.          If the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companiesThe intention is that Unilever will follow Royal Dutch Shell and the publishing and media colossus Reed Elsevier (now renamed Relx) which both separately decided to unify their shares under one umbrella while keeping share quotations in London as part of the FTSE 100 index.But Unilever wants to go one step further by coming out of the FTSE 100, claiming that it has more major Dutch than British investors. The truth is that the British Establishment’s reaction has been pathetic.It has shown monumental weakness and done nothing to ensure that Unilever stays here, while the Dutch government has done all in its power to encourage the move.A juicy carrot offered to Unilever chiefs by the Netherlands is the abolition of a measure that forces companies to pay the tax on idends distributed to shareholders upfront. This brings the Dutch system into line with the UK, which did the same several years ago as part of a successful effort to simplify our tax structure and make Britain the most attractive location for inward investment from overseas in Europe.          Prince Harry with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (right) and Paul Polman (left), CEO of Unilever backstage at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Annual Awards Dinner Honoring HRH Prince Harry at Ritz Carlton Hotel in Washington, DCThis tax change may have been the decisive factor for a Dutch-dominated board of directors. But there can be no doubt that their planned move to Rotterdam has been influenced by the Government’s woeful recent record at defending British companies against foreign predators.It’s a tragic truth that Britain has been allowed to become the most open market in the world to overseas takeovers – often with disastrous consequences for our national interests.For example, the £11.5billion takeover of Cadbury by Kraft led to the chocolate giant’s headquarters closing, its tax domicile switching from Britain to low-tax Switzerland and the unpopular meddling with the size, ingredients and taste of emblematic brands, including the Creme Egg.Other leading British brands have also been sold off, such as Costa Coffee being taken over by Coca-Cola, a company that has been heavily criticised for tax avoidance.By contrast, the Dutch authorities are much more protective against foreign takeovers.Last year, the chemical and paint giant Akzo Nobel (the owner of Britain’s Dulux brand) defended itself against a hostile bid by garnering the support of works councils, which have a key role in such takeover talks, as well as using provisions in Dutch competition law. Indeed, there is a clear view among analysts and some shareholders that the real purpose of Unilever’s proposal to move its domicile is to give itself maximum protection from any future bids for the group or attempts to force it to demerge any of its major brands.Aside from any other considerations, I am convinced that the decision to migrate from Britain makes no commercial sense.The fastest growing part of Unilever’s erse business involves beauty brands such as Dove and household products including Persil. There seems to be an insatiable demand for them from emerging economies in Asia and Latin America. The brains behind these best-sellers would remain in the UK because they are expected to make up 75 per cent of global sales, while the teams behind Unilever’s ice cream range Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and lesser products such as Lipton tea will be working in Holland.Whatever the management thinks, the major restructuring decision to separate the share quotation base and domicile from the home of the company’s main business is irrational.Inevitably, too, there are bound to be profound concerns that the Treasury could lose millions of pounds of corporate taxes from Unilever as a result of a switch to Rotterdam.Significantly, Holland has a reputation as a home for tax avoidance, with laws that offer a shield from taxation on profits.Such enticements have lured firms including Starbucks, Google and IBM to set up offices, while the Rolling Stones and U2, too, have taken advantage of Dutch tax shelters.Of course, there has been a widespread suspicion that Unilever’s break from the FTSE 100 is being done as a protective measure in case trading conditions suffer as a result of Brexit.However, my conversations with Unilever executives do not lead me to think this is a major issue, although it may be preying on the minds of Dutch shareholders and bosses driving the process.Even so, I am utterly convinced that if Unilever leaves Britain, the company will do itself great damage.Its shares would be less attractive to both overseas and British investors who value Anglo-Saxon capitalism, the weight of financial expertise in Britain and access to the strongest capital markets in Europe.With Britain’s national interest at stake, is it beyond hope that the Government might finally wake up to the huge potential cost to this country’s economy of what would be a calamitous decision for a company as important as Unilever to move its HQ abroad? "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/16/504D69A600000578-0-image-m-59_1537198254203.jpg","title":"Derbyshire dog owner returns holiday Croatia news Staffordshire terrier down","story":"    Staffordshire bull terrier, Blue, was put down by kennel staff while his owner was on holidayMr Hall, who suffers from depression, said Blue was helping him to tackle his mental health issues.The father-of-four was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 and had to tell his children that their beloved pet had gone to \u0027doggy heaven\u0027.He said: \u0027Blue didn\u0027t have a violent bone in his body.

I couldn\u0027t wait to see him when I got back from my holiday. He was my best friend.\u0027After returning from Croatia Mr Hall phoned the kennels after finding  an information card  posted through his door saying they had his dog.But they told him over the phone that Blue had been put down as he was \u0027aggressive towards the residents and officers\u0027.           Owner David Hall (pictured) suffers from depression and Blue \u0027helped him pull himself together\u0027Mr went to say his \u0027final goodbyes\u0027 to Blue, who was in a \u0027big chest-freezer\u0027 at the kennels. He then collected Blue\u0027s ashes a few weeks later.The council\u0027s policy states that if a dog is not collected within seven days, it is then the property of the council.A Derby City Council spokesperson said: \u0027Mr Hall\u0027s dog was picked up by our contracted stray dog service, after he was reported by a member of the public to be on a public highway.\u0027Some local residents kindly kept the dog until officers were able to get to him. He was reportedly aggressive towards the residents and officers.\u0027The dog had no tag, but officers scanned the dog for contact details of the owner.\u0027We tried to call Mr Hall however got no response, and so visited the address, and an information card was left when there was no answer.          Mr Hall\u0027s neighbour had taken Blue for a walk when the dog ran away and was captured by wardens\u0027As we were unable to reunite the dog with its owner, he was taken to kennels. Stray dogs are cared for in kennels for seven days, after which point, they are legally owned by Derby City Council.\u0027Our kennels received no contact from the friend or owner, and there was no report of this dog being lost.\u0027The dog showed signs of aggression to the kennel owner and kennel staff, so after the seven days had passed, and no contact had been received, we had to take the difficult decision to put the dog to sleep.\u0027Dogs who show aggression and cannot safely be adopted or rehomed are, where appropriate, put to sleep.\u0027We do not take that decision lightly, and would only ever decide to put a dog to sleep if it was deemed absolutely necessary.\u0027Had the kennels received information or were contacted to state that the owners were on holiday then the dog would of course have remained in kennels to allow the owners to come forward. On returning from his holiday, the owner has contacted the Council and we have fully discussed the situation with him.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/30/08/4EAF3F9100000578-0-image-m-5_1532935106602.jpg","title":"RAC withdraws advice drivers avoid speed cameras fierce backlash cyclists","story":"    The RAC was forced to withdraw advice on its website for motorists on how to avoid speed cameras.

He was facing deportation because he had never applied for British citizenship despite having lived in the UK since he was 12.Under UK law, if a foreign national has been sentenced to more than four years in jail “the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances”. Adoboli, who left Ghana when he was four, was sentenced to seven years for the fraud and served half that time.Adoboli’s deportation appeared all but sealed earlier on Monday when the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, refused to intervene to review the deportation order, despite appeals from 132 MPs and a petition signed by more than 73,000 people. Nokes said the decision to deport Adoboli had been “upheld independently, at several stages, by the courts” and it would be inappropriate for her to act.With the hours ticking down to his departure, Adoboli’s lawyers submitted an application for a judicial review of his case in a last-ditch attempt to prevent his “banishment” from his friends and family in the UK.Adoboli had already had an application for judicial review rejected by the courts, and his lawyers were not confident the final attempt – made on public interest grounds – would succeed. But a judge granted the appeal for judicial review and injunction against deportation.Adoboli’s lawyers expect him to be freed from an immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport within days and released on bail until the outcome of the judicial review, which could take several months.Adoboli’s lawyer, Jacqui McKenzie, said: “Common sense has broken out: sending a 38-year-old man to a country where he has not lived since the age of four was always madness, given that he has lived in Britain since the age of 12 and the UK is where his friends and partner live and where his family life is based. It is unquestionably his home. Let’s hope that will be the judgment, as and when it is made.”Hannah Bardell, Adoboli’s MP, who had led a campaign to keep him in the UK, said on Twitter: “A really incredible result, we never gave up hope and we’ll keep fighting!”In explaining her decision not to intervene to prevent the deportation, Nokes said: “Although Mr Adoboli’s offence was not one of violence, he committed a serious offence and this was reflected in the length of his sentence. Financial crime, like all crime, has an impact on the society that we live in and the public expects robust action to be taken against foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crime.Nokes said the government was “committed to a fair and humane immigration policy” and she rejected the suggestion that Adoboli’s treatment was similar to that of the Windrush generation of immigrants.“The Home Office recognises the weight of dissatisfaction towards the treatment of the Windrush generation and officials are working hard to put this right,” she said. “I do not believe that the issues faces by the Windrush generation, who were legally resident in the United Kingdom but did not have the documentation to prove it, are analogous to Mr Adoboli’s case.”Nokes has previously blocked at least two British citizens on Twitter when they asked for her assistance after the Home Office failed to respond to their complaints or appeals from their MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e21cb8a1b0f48a011833078b29c768dcd308298/0_66_5487_3292/master/5487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c3ddef812d4caca48c30f0d42dff94","title":"unilever cant just expect uk fund managers to agree on going dutch","story":"The firm wants to incorporate in the Netherlands, but UK shareholders have a duty to make their voice heard About time too.

The problem is the effect of the revamp on UK funds.A Dutch-incorporated Unilever would retain a listing in London but, critically, wouldn’t be eligible for the FTSE 100 index, the FTSE 350 index and FTSE All-Share indices. Exclusion is a big deal for the likes of Aviva, whose funds mostly track those indices or are benchmarked against them. For such funds, investing in Unilever would become either impossible or harder.The position is unsatisfactory but Unilever has brought it on itself. It cannot expect all UK fund managers just to swallow obediently and do what the board says is best. Fund managers have duties of their own, principally to their end-investors, the people who pay their fees. Cumming is merely doing his job in standing up for UK interests and arguing that a large, cash-generative core holding is not a stock to be surrendered without a very good reason.All the big traditional UK houses – Legal \u0026amp General, Standard Life Aberdeen, M\u0026ampG, and so on – are on the Unilever register. They should know that silence on this issue is not an option. They are paid to have a view – and to justify it to the people whose money they manage. Speak up.Most successful upstart clothing retailers reach a point when the founders decide the business is best run, day to day, by an experienced operator from outside. Here’s Boohoo’s moment. John Lyttle, the No 2 at Primark, is joining as chief executive. Primark resolutely refuses to sell online, whereas that’s all Lyttle’s new employer does, but Boohoo’s co-founders Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane probably figure they’ve got the techie stuff covered.However, one wonders whether they’ve thought about the impact through the organisation. If you were a Boohoo executive outside the boardroom, you’d surely be lobbying for a piece of the same five-year bonus bonanza. And why not? And why not further down the employee ranks? Lyttle may be good but the cult of the superstar chief executive is usually over-done.Jaguar Land Rover, when it cites “headwinds” as the reason for switching 2,000 staff to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant, may chiefly be referring to sluggish demand for diesel vehicles. Brexit-induced uncertainty may be only a secondary factor.Yet there’s still a moral here for Bernard Jenkin and those other Tory MPs who dismiss JLR’s regular warnings about the effect of a hard Brexit as “scaremongering”. Car plants are robust in that they are hard to shift overnight but their economics are simultaneously fragile. A few unwelcome winds can force a change in the direction of investment. If diesel can cause a three-day working week, a hard Brexit next March could do far more damage. Jenkin should pipe down. Car companies, and their workers, are closer to the market than he is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ae89ebb9e9bab01fa3eca64d4daa85a622c2519/262_25_1568_941/master/1568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4de0d3c36dafa7e9c93a50389e85ac42","title":"britains insecure towns left behind","story":"It can be found in the opening pages of a book published in 2014: one of the most influential ideas in modern British politics, given its first airing in the days when Ukip was on a roll, and the forces that would propel Britain towards Brexit were decisively coming into view. “Over recent decades,” goes the text, “deep social and economic changes have hit particular groups within British society particularly hard: older, less skilled and less educated working-class voters. These are the groups we describe as the ‘left behind’ in modern Britain, who could once rely on the strength of their numbers to ensure a voice in each of the mainstream parties.”Revolt on the Right: Explaining Support for the Radical Right in Britain was written by the academics Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford its thesis was that the two main parties had ignored these people for decades, and their resulting resentment was now exploding into the open. In this sense, the term “left behind” was initially focused on neglect by politics and politicians – but it also implicitly referred to matters of culture and economics, and as the national media became newly interested in people and places way beyond the M25, the concept was quickly stretched.Soon enough, the formulation “left behind” took on a deeply condescending aspect, as if people in more affluent cities and suburbs were happily gliding into the future, while many towns were clinging to a sepia-tinted vision of a mislaid Albion and hoping to somehow get back there. The notion that all support for Brexit was reducible to a hopeless nostalgia, tinged with outright racism a yearning, as the venerable Vince Cable later put it, for “a world where passports were blue, faces were white and the map was coloured imperial pink”.In fact, as with so many other towns, what Walsall represents is the social and economic cutting edge, albeit in a very different way from more affluent parts of the country. The future it is entering is not manifested in the gleam of luxury flats, or the promise of lives rendered blissfully easy by technology: the town is troubled, and clearly in need of help, but that does not make it any less modern. Walsall’s economic past revolved around leather and metalwork now, one of its most notable features is a giant TK Maxx distribution centre next to the M6. There is employment to be had in and around the town, but it is increasingly insecure, and vulnerable to automation, a fact brought into sharp focus by my conversation with a man whose work in the logistics ision of Iceland is built on only 20 hours of guaranteed work a week. “Nothing’s solid,” he told me: a pretty pithy encapsulation of the 21st-century condition.Two weeks ago I spent the afternoon at the gates of the vast Amazon distribution centre in the former coal town of Rugeley in Staffordshire, where people from Walsall are brought to work in buses, the blacked-out windows of which give off a strange sense of secrecy and paranoia. The centre sits in the shadow of a disused power station and next to a new Premier Inn and a branch of McDonald’s. It is one of the most surreal corners of England I’ve set foot in: a parade of auguries of the future in which we may all soon find ourselves.Walsall confounds one more stereotype: the idea that Britain is now full of communities devoid of what some call social capital, and unable to organise anything for themselves. I spent a day following the work of an amazing organisation called the Old Hall People’s Partnership, whose activities run from benefits advice through libraries and counselling services, to gardening and household maintenance for people who cannot afford market rates. Its sheer energy and collective refusal to be confined within traditional categories of public service point to two very modern truths: that people have long since pushed beyond the idea that they have to wait for the beneficent big state to help them out and that if austerity is eventually avenged and the public realm is rebuilt, we will have a great deal to learn from what such people have been doing in these supposedly “left behind” places in the interim.If towns such as Walsall are not really “left behind” in the economic and cultural sense, their place in politics has also changed. The idea that elections are always decided in affluent, often suburban marginals has receded. Two years after the referendum, in the corners of politics not consumed by the mechanics of Brexit, a conversation about towns and their predicament is never far away.Labour lost the seat of Walsall North to the Conservatives in last year’s election – one of the five seats the party lost among the 126 in which there was a swing from Labour to the Tories. The loss of Walsall North is evidence of why Jeremy Corbyn’s party is said to have a “towns problem”. Of the 64 seats Labour needs to win a parliamentary majority of one, 31 are essentially town constituencies among its top 100 targets, the figure is 49. This is why, over the summer, Corbyn visited not only Walsall, but Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, Corby, Telford, Stoke-on-Trent South and Mansfield. It also partially explains shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s focus on rising insecurity at work, and how best to deal with it.For sure, in the midst of the insecurity and uncertainty such places often embody, a small minority of people have taken refuge in bigotry and sounding off about immigration. But each time I have gone back to Walsall, what I have heard people express with the greatest regularity is a yearning for things that ought to be beyond argument: community, stability, an assurance that they will be able to plan for next year, and the year after that.These are modern demands voiced in truly modern places – what stands in their way is an enduring disconnect between progressive politicians and the social grassroots. This problem is encapsulated by the fact that the only political offer to have truly cut through in recent years was the chimera of Brexit. Moreover, many people in Walsall are unimpressed by Labour’s transformation, and still see it as a collection of metropolitan people indifferent both to their communitarian values and the nitty-gritty of their lives.This is arguably the biggest challenge Labour faces, and tackling it has to start with a realisation some might see as counterintuitive to the point of logical impossibility: that all of sudden, it is the “left behind” who hold the key to the country’s future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbc457b124b86b2eeb71cb49383623437d8db993/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f5557d43f63becd0a5cff5bdfa298c9","title":"rod liddle spectator race","story":"The publication of racist views is now permissible – and the print media is to blameIn 2010, I started a campaign against Rod Liddle becoming editor of the Independent as it was rumoured he would. When I say campaign, I mean that I joked on Facebook that I should be the editor, not him. People took it seriously as though there were a remote possibility of this when everyone knows I am allergic to offices, don’t believe in meetings longer than 10 minutes and am the world’s crappest schmoozer.My credentials were simply that I loved that paper and did not want it edited by a racist misogynist, which is how I then perceived Liddle. The common assault on his pregnant girlfriend, for which he accepted a police caution but later denied, was public knowledge.Whatever part of the left Liddle claimed once to represent, his downtrodden man-of-the-people-libertarian-shtick was already apparent. He sent me some odd messages, called me “Suze”, slagged me off because I worked at the Mail on Sunday, which had claimed he left racist messages on football forums (some of which Liddle has denied).The best bit was that I had a party to celebrate NOT becoming editor of The Independent, a job that no one would ever offer me anyway, but this is the way I like to carry on in this carousel of nonsense that is the media.Liddle carried on, too, upping the ante in that now-familiar: “Will no one but brave little me talk about immigration?” tone. He moved such views right into the mainstream. Poison is what happens when you speak truth not to power, but to bait the powerless.It is neither funny nor clever, but it titillates the right’s intelligentsia in magazines such as the Spectator. The respectability of a periodical allows Liddle to now write: “I have spent the morning trying to draw a cartoon of a black person without it being racist. It’s bloody difficult. Especially the lips.” Puke-making. From web forum to the heart of the establishment (Muslim women as postboxes, anyone?) – the publication of racist and Islamophobic comments is now permitted.This didn’t happen overnight in a vacuum. We can crow all we like over Katie Hopkins’ recent financial troubles, but it doesn’t change the environment that allowed her to flourish. I lost track of when she went too far, of when she began freelancing for any far-right cause that would have her. She became the woman in the street, the woman who gets her facts wrong, who hates her own weakness so much that she turns her bile on to the very weakest.She does not have the smarts of Liddle. I say that without irony. He knows what he does she is a dumb opportunist. It was OK to call drowning migrants cockroaches. Editors let her do that just as the Spectator enables its “alt-right” bros. The mainstreaming of racist discourse manifests through Ukip, the EDL, the Yaxley-Lennon groupies – but it is made credible by print journalism, by adults saying things for which children would be reprimanded. To discuss the psyches of a Liddle or a Hopkins, who are just begging to be denounced by liberals, is for another day. White supremacy is reaching power in the US and neo-Nazis gather in Europe.We have witnessed full-blown racism becoming respectable as public discourse. Enablers of addicts allow them to escape the consequences of their actions. Editors have done this. So no, I don’t have the wherewithal to edit a paper, but I sure as hell know that these editorial decisions are nothing to do with free speech or even journalism. I would not publish this filth, that’s for sure.You’ve got to love Cerys Matthews staging a one-woman bit of class war on her BBC 6 Music show. She doesn’t want to play music from people who have been given the “leg-up” of going to private school. She would like to play music from a wider pool of people. She said, quite reasonably, that social mobility has stalled and that “we all have the onus on us to keep progress going to make sure all classes, all colours, all creeds, all genders get the opportunity to get where they need to be going. That’s not happening at the minute.”The charts are dominated by folk who went to private school. Just as acting is. Just as publishing is. Every time this is mentioned, some poor sap will say it’s not fair because children don’t get to choose where their parents sent them to school. The public-schoolchild cri de coeur is always: “Its not my fault, but I just happened to have an enormous amount of contacts as well as being supertalented.”Either culture, in the widest sense, represents all of us, or it is simply finishing school with a soundtrack. Certainly, culture failed to represent what was going on in this country, as Brexit seemed an utter shock to the entire artistic establishment.Of course, working-class artists break through and are then fetishised for their authenticity. It was ever thus. The fact that the dreadful Tory MP Philip Davies has called for Matthews’ resignation is a good sign. Seriously, has he nothing better to do?The idea that Cerys will not play Florence + the Machine, Coldplay and Clean Bandit but will play Nina Simone, Ghostpoet and David Bowie means she has not simply class, albeit of the wrong kind, but taste.Is anyone at the Lib Dem conference apart from some TV crews? Where even is it? I speak as someone who used to go to these things, for my sins. There was that rose-garden interlude of Clegg and Cameron, but now where is this flock of super-reasonable beings to find a leader? Gina Miller is there, talking about the End of Chaos, but chaos is at least exciting this is just collapse.

After all, such mainstays of British culture as curry, the Notting Hill carnival and bearded Muslim sports heroes were at one time all viewed as inimical to it. Cultures are dynamic things, developing organically from communities. They do not exist in isolation or remain static. Having a range of cultures in Britain is normal, not novel.If so, then why are so many still resistant? There is a straightforward economic analysis: austerity has shrunk the space we might share, be that schools, parks or hospitals, while growing inequalities supply people with new opportunities to scapegoat minorities. Then there is a barrage of claims about a government policy of encouraging cultural difference at the expense of national cohesion. There is no state-led segregation policy today. British governments are not in the habit of sacrificing the nation on the altar of imaginary cultural preferences. Yet years of anger stoked around this falsehood found, unfortunately, an outlet in the Brexit\u0026nbspreferendum.The thinktank British Future, which commissioned the poll and produced an in-depth study looking at immigration and integration, should be congratulated for engaging the public in a debate about their views and concerns on these subjects. It is no surprise that nine out of 10 respondents either strongly agreed or tended to agree that, in order to integrate, migrants ought to learn English, pay their taxes and respect democracy. There is nothing controversial about such opinions. Immigrant communities as a whole are hardly likely to disagree with any of them. What this research does not do is expose tensions between the demands of integration into wider society and the measures required to preserve cultural ersity.Identity is a fact about us, but it should not define the horizon of our possibilities. It is a paradox that in an age where iniduals have been most sovereign over the identities they assert, the politics of nationalism has become most potent. Some of the reasons why are obvious: nations offer a ready-made identity that is a cipher of commonly agreed myths. But liberal politics across the world has been noticeably susceptible to being overtaken by rightwing nationalists. Too often, this is because defenders of liberal values end up aligning them with a particular way of life, underpinning this by claiming there is a limit to how much ersity a welfare state can tolerate. This thought process leads to many wrong-headed policies – most notably in Britain to an arbitrary numerical cap on immigration.What is lacking to counter such arguments is a project to get people to bridge their differences just as much as they bond over their similarities. The more people from different backgrounds trust each other, the better off their society. Politicians ought to be preaching the need to learn how to get along with strangers. That needs an honest conversation about the laws of association – that is, how we can legally group together. Other nations do this. The US prohibits discrimination in rental housing unless you have four or fewer units to let. One may bond with one’s ethnic peers in an exclusionary fashion as long as one limits the scale of those bonds. What needs attention are the small cliques that hoard contacts, access to information and, ultimately, power. Challenging those would ensure Britain fosters egalitarian and representative cultures. That is what, surely everyone agrees, the country needs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c6539deecb07c0c70d8b97b50fd7cf96c451b0/19_126_2366_1419/master/2366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7e62feecb3da5d10f46c1bb4e1a4d81","title":"burberrys new boss riccardo tisci unveils seductive and serene show london fashion week","story":"Designer Riccardo Tisci says he wanted the brand’s new look to ‘celebrate eclecticism’Riccardo Tisci’s Burberry debut shocked London fashion week in the one way no one expected.An audience braced on Monday for Tisci’s trademark brand of catwalk scandal – men in dresses, women in sideburns, cars on fire, breasts bared – were confronted instead with sublimely elegant, Parisian-accented chic. Knife-pleated skirts were worn with blazers, high-waisted trousers with scarf-print blouses, and everything with neatly coiffed ballerina buns and high-heeled court shoes.And then, just when the audience were getting comfortable with this seductive haute-bourgeois new vision for Burberry, the aesthetic was flipped upside down and a contrasting look took over: zippered mini skirts, metal-trimmed anoraks, with stompy flat shoes and harsh winged eyeliner.The biggest surprise of all was that it was the first section – the serene, ladylike pieces – that stood out as the winning look. Tisci, fashion’s favourite rebel, turns out to be a dab hand at Hermès-esque chic, to which he adds a hefty dose of sex appeal. A leather pencil skirt with a chiffon underlay, fluid black evening gowns suspended from delicately glinting metal straps, a leopard-spotted skirt over a slim leotard and a tailored trench dress had the audience seduced.“Burberry is such a big part of British style. It is like the flag of England,” he explained, adding that he focused on tailoring because “I was the first one to do streetwear on the catwalk – and now I think fashion has got too street.”The changing of the guard at Burberry is the most significant reshuffle to happen to British fashion in years. Burberry is the biggest, most powerful, homegrown fashion brand, which means its new designer has the power to change the weather over the whole of the UK fashion landscape.In 17 years, Christopher Bailey had so steeped Burberry in his Yorkshire-rooted, romantically nostalgic vision of Britishness that few in the industry could imagine the house in a different guise. For 12 of those years, Tisci was at Givenchy, where he remade a house founded on the gamine charms of Audrey Hepburn as a byword for darkly gothic glamour.The twin pillars of the house of Burberry are the trench coat and the house check. Both were given starring roles in this debut. (Backstage the designer described himself as “obsessed” with the trench coat.) Trench-beige dominated the colour palette, while the check – sometimes pared back to a stripe – appeared on bags and blouses, or glimpsed as a lining.Tisci described the collection as “a celebration of the cultures, the traditions and the codes of this historic fashion house and of the eclecticism that makes up the beautifully erse United Kingdom”.He had hinted at a punk take on Britishness with his early choice of collaborators. In the run-up to the show, he tapped up the iconic graphic designer Peter Saville, best known for the album sleeves he designed for Factory Records, including Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures and New Order’s Movement.His counter-cultural leanings made Saville an intriguing person to Tisci to task with reframing Burberry. Saville described the monogram he designed, based on the initials of the house founder Thomas Burberry, as “an identity that taps into the heritage of the company in a way that suggests the 21st century cultural coordinates of what Burberry could be”.December will see the release of a limited-edition Burberry collection designed with Vivienne Westwood, whom Tisci reveres. “Vivienne Westwood was one of the first designers who made me dream to become a designer myself,” he said when the collection was announced. “She is a rebel, a punk and unrivalled in her unique representation of British style.”There was added pressure on this debut because Burberry have been battling a firestorm of negative publicity in the wake of revelations that £28.6 million worth of unsold product was destroyed last year. The policy – designed to guard prestige by making sure Burberry products did not get marked down or languish unsold – backfired dramatically, sparking outrage for being environmentally irresponsible.Marco Gobbetti, who joined Burberry as CEO last year, swiftly issued an apology and announced an immediate end to the policy. “Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible,” he said. The company also announced that it will no longer sell real fur.

Let’s go for a beer … I’m here for you.’”Movember was launched more than a decade ago, growing year by year, and tackles issues around prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and suicide prevention. It is best known for encouraging men to grow a moustache in November.Stockton said a chance meeting with Movember’s Ben Bowers spawned the idea of the charity auction.“Artists, historically, do struggle with mental illness and feeling isolated and lonely … I know I have in the past. I’ve felt very isolated. Our work is very public but in some respects we are very private and insecure.”He said he wanted to encourage men to “talk about their problems rather than keeping them bottled up”.“I strongly believe street art has the ability to breach the social stigma of men’s mental health, to collapse this invisible boundary that’s causing men to keep their struggles to themselves.”The nine other artists giving works are Shepard Fairey, most famous for his Barack Obama “Hope” poster the French urban artist Invader the Puerto Rican painter and muralist Alexis Diaz the Spanish street artist Okuda the Portuguese artist Vhils, perhaps best known for chiselling portraits into walls the Argentinian-Spanish artist Felipe Pantone London-based Irish aritst Conor Harrington and the portrait artist Jonathan Yeo.Bowers, global innovation lead and ambassador for the charity, said: “It gives a great platform to start these conversations around men’s mental health and suicide prevention.“Everyone has mental health and some struggle with it and for a sector like the art world, for these artists to come out from behind the canvas and speak to their own experiences and show that people aren’t alone … it is a powerful way to put this on the agenda.”The works will be on display at Sotheby’s London headquarters from 16 to 19 November before the sale on 20 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d06cda0d87e39ba692d4fc65ec48103d135ff3f/0_0_2251_1500/master/2251.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=86179d1ba2be72a757e6fa3ea87b1c82","title":"asia argento legal action against rose mcgowan","story":"McGowan asked to retract a statement made following sexual assault claim against Argento by actor Jimmy BennettAsia Argento has threatened to take “immediate legal action” against Rose McGowan unless the latter retracts a statement she made on 27 August following accusations of sexual assault against Argento by actor Jimmy Bennett.Argento posted a statement on social media demanding that within 24 hours McGowan retract the “horrendous lies” she claimed were contained in the statement. “If you fail to address this libel I will have no option other than to take immediate legal action.”Argento, a prominent figure in the Harvey Weinstein scandal and who in an October 2017 New Yorker article accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her, was herself accused of sexual assault by actor Jimmy Bennett in a New York Times article in August.

By this time last year, we had already seen seven of the nine nominees for best picture and as the frantic pace of Telluride, Venice and Toronto fades, it’s time to look back on the buzz that’s become most deafening.While using the term frontrunner might be a tad presumptuous at this stage, it appears as if there are two films that have garnered the warmest notices thus far and both premiered during this year’s Venice film festival. The first is Roma, the intimate new drama from Alfonso Cuarón, that’s looking like Netflix’s first best picture contender, a major milestone for the streaming platform given their increase in alliances with world-class auteurs. They’re thirsty for it too, with a splashy campaign under way and reports that the film could be their first to receive an exclusive cinematic release before it heads online. Reviews have been almost universally enthusiastic, with the ’s Peter Bradshaw awarding it five stars, calling it Cuarón’s “best film so far”. But is the often musty academy ready to introduce Netflix to the big league and will the fact that it’s in Spanish restrict its chances to the foreign language film category?A far more Oscar-ready proposition is Bradley Cooper’s take on the music-driven romance A Star is Born, which scored a roaring reception in Venice and continued the hype through to Toronto. It’s a wildly popular crowd-pleaser with Cooper’s name mentioned in both lead actor and director categories but the performance that’s been talked about the most is that of Lady Gaga who has pretty much already won the best actress in a musical or comedy category at the Golden Globes but is set to compete in the best actress Oscar race as well. Her competition will probably include Olivia Colman who impressed Venice and Telluride audiences with her performance as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’s darkly comic romp The Favourite which could also see either previous winners Emma Stone or Rachel Weisz in the best supporting actress category. One performance that quietly made a mark at Toronto last year, Glenn Close in the literary drama The Wife, was finally given a theatrical release over the summer and the six-time nominee could score another nod come January.Audiences at Telluride and Toronto also gravitated towards Melissa McCarthy’s turn in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, the tragic-comic true story of author Lee Israel who became a master of forgery. She’s likely to pick up a best actress nomination while Richard E Grant, who plays her unlikely drinking buddy, is heading for a best supporting actor nod. The film landed better than The Front Runner, another true story also premiering at the Colorado-based festival, the tale of disgraced senator Gary Hart. The Jason Reitman-directed drama, starring Hugh Jackman in the lead, received mixed reviews and by the time it screened in Toronto, buzz was quiet, although in a muted year for best actor, don’t count Jackman out just yet. There was a similar fate at Telluride for Joel Edgerton’s much-anticipated gay conversion drama Boy Erased which, despite a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe and Lucas Hedges, was met with politeness rather than passion and is unlikely to make an impression in this year’s race.The same festival also saw two Oscar winners reveal two very different movies. Robert Redford looks like a sure thing, playing a stick-up artist in Old Man and the Gun, especially given his decision to retire, while Nicole Kidman’s turn as an amoral detective in Destroyer will probably be too dark for the academy, with the film also receiving mixed reviews.On paper, critics weren’t sure what to expect from Steve McQueen’s Widows, a remake of an ITV Lynda La Plante series that marked a giant commercial leap into the multiplex for the director of 12 Years a Slave and Shame. But his ruthlessly entertaining star-studded thriller proved to be one of the most popular films in Toronto, garnering strong reviews with captivated audience reactions suggesting it will be a big hit on release. But is it too much of a genre offering to impress the academy? It certainly deserves inclusion and if they do go big for it then Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki and a fantastically sinister turn from Daniel Kaluuya could also figure in the race.The circuit also brought new films from Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins, two directors who dominated the Oscars back in 2017 (Chazelle picked up best director for La La Land while Jenkins scored a shock best picture victory with Moonlight). The former picked the story of the moon landing in the large-scale drama First Man, re-teaming with Ryan Gosling who took on the role of Neil Armstrong. Reviews were strong, with a few misgivings, suggesting that both the film and Gosling could factor into the conversation. Jenkins’ adaptation of James Baldwin’s If Beale Street Could Talk might have been bigger-budgeted than his breakout but it was far from a step into commercialism, its lyrical, slow-paced ode to the power of love unlikely to please everyone. But it was met with deservingly strong reviews from critics and is close to a sure thing for academy and guild voters, its beautiful artistry likely to be recognised in a number of categories (everything from production design to costumes) with Emmy-loved Regina King also seeming like a strong possibility for best supporting actress for her performance as a strong-willed mother.One of the season’s biggest surprises came near the end of Toronto with the premiere of Green Book, a charming crowd-pleaser from Peter Farrelly that could be this year’s dark horse. It’s a broad look at racial tensions in the 60s with a warm heart and will likely continue to play like gangbusters until its smartly timed Thanksgiving release. Expect it to show up in a number of categories, including acting recognition for Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. It also pulled off a shock victory, winning the people’s choice award in Toronto. Many had expected it to go to A Star is Born (with help from some little monsters) but Green Book was voted the most popular film with audiences and given that in previous years, the title has gone to 12 Years a Slave, The King’s Speech and Slumdog Millionaire, it’s a strong sign of things to come.The furore over the now-axed popular movie category was largely populated by pundits viewing it as a patronising way to ensure that Black Panther received some academy love but the film’s phenomenal year could see it become the first superhero adventure to receive a best picture nomination anyway. Acting-wise, Michael B Jordan’s show-stopping turn as Killmonger might see him receive a deserved best supporting actor nod too. If nominated, he could face Timothée Chalamet whose haunting performance as a meth addict in the grim drama Beautiful Boy received universal acclaim in Toronto even if the film itself was met with a mixed response. In Ben is Back, another film about addiction that premiered at the festival, Julia Roberts earned praise for playing a struggling mother and given her academy history, she could also gain a nod.There are still some major films to debut, however, and ones that could have a huge impact on the race. The biggest of these is Vice from Adam McKay, following up The Big Short with a dramatisation of the life of Dick Cheney, played by Christian Bale, with Amy Adams taking on his wife. With a cast that also includes Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, Sam Rockwell as George Bush, Bill Pullman as Nelson Rockefeller and Tyler Perry as Colin Powell, expect it to be a contender. There could also be love for Mary Poppins Returns, a film Disney has so much faith in that it reportedly led to them releasing their annual Star Wars offering in the summer just to avoid a clash. Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Colin Firth star. Netflix also has Susanne Bier’s post-apocalyptic thriller Bird Box which could be big for star Sandra Bullock while both the actress and best supporting actress races could see nods for Mary Queen of Scots, starring Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. Finally, Fox hopes to rise above the negative on-set drama for Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody which could launch Rami Malek into the best actor competition.Robert Redford – best actor, Old Man and the Gun"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/581e3f2e79009025b4a0866a7170c7173881ac3e/0_2289_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9255f69f6859f3fc43424a483392a49f","title":"photographs by iranian film makers abbas kiarostami jafar panahi","story":"Despite facing censorship, house arrest and exile, directors such as Jafar Panahi and the late Abbas Kiarostami kept Iran at the forefront of world cinema.

That was eclipsed by a return of 91 from Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané for Liverpool, however, as Klopp’s team set a competition record of 47 goals in 15 Champions League games en route to the final defeat by Real Madrid. The Liverpool manager insists he would not change any of his forward line for the world’s most expensive player, the prolific Uruguayan or France’s World Cup winner.Klopp admitted Liverpool’s impressive start as a defensive unit will be severely tested by the French champions at Anfield. “It is the biggest test of our defending so far for sure, not only of our defence. If you let them pass in specific areas, they decide alone if they score or not because of the speed, because of the mix of speed and technical abilities. All of them want to score goals.”Klopp channelled his inner Madonna to explain how last season’s run to the final could benefit his team. “We have to start new, use the experience but not rely on it,” he said. “The best way is when you are experienced and you use your new knowledge and start again like a virgin.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d679b567f30263a4070bf135f5711dfbee91b4c/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c6e2a25183a98a578e686a273ba2240","title":"southampton brighton premier league match report","story":"Southampton actually enjoyed some breathing space. It was not for long, admittedly, given it took Brighton a little under two minutes to set home nerves jangling again. Saints’ players may struggle to recall that blissful century of seconds when the stuffing appeared to have been knocked out of their opponents and they were coasting serenely towards only a second home league win in 10 months. In the end the overriding sensation was one of familiar, numbing disappointment, of the kind they endure too often on their own patch.That was soon overtaken by livid frustration. “We were 2-0 up against an opponent we have to beat … it’s not good enough,” grumbled Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, scorer of the game’s most spectacular goal far earlier in the match. As panic gripped in stoppage time, he watched aghast as James Ward-Prowse was penalised for fouling Shane Duffy and the referee awarded a penalty.Brighton are making a habit of eye-popping comebacks but that was no consolation for Southampton. They have dropped 26 points from winning positions in the Premier League since the start of last season, and 13 in 13 matches under Mark Hughes.It was Glenn Murray, inevitably given his penchant for scoring against Saints, who maintained his composure to convert the penalty, stroking his 98th Brighton goal beyond Alex McCarthy to complete a second successive two-goal comeback.The goalkeeper must still have been staggered that it had come to this given his excellent save to deny Jürgen Locadia seconds earlier only for Ward-Prowse, one of the smaller players on the pitch and seeking to block off Duffy at the set piece, to commit his offence at the resultant corner. Hughes pointed out the centre-half is “a big boy and has gone down a bit easily” but his real exasperation centred on the wastefulness of it all. Brighton might have been buried by the break. They should certainly have been seen off at 2-0. To have claimed some kind of reward from such an anaemic first-half display said much about the character of Chris Hughton’s side. It had been Hojbjerg whose goal had left them winded, the Dane taking a touch as he collected 30 yards out and, with Yves Bissouma slow to close him down, cutting across the ball with the sweetest of connections to rip his shot towards the far corner where it swerved beyond the sprawling Mat Ryan.That merely confirmed Saints’ dominance given the excellence of Ryan Bertrand and Nathan Redmond down the left. Mohamed Elyounoussi and Danny Ings should already have scored by then. Southampton had departed at the interval mystified by their lead being still so slender.Ings would earn himself a clearer sight of goal after the break after darting into the penalty box and slipping in a tangle of legs under Gaëten Bong’s challenge. A third reward in four games was claimed from the penalty spot, with Gareth Southgate watching on from the stands and presumably more inclined than ever to recall him to the England fold. As the players ambled back into position from their joyous huddle, Southampton dared to dream they had done enough.Brighton had already offered flashes of renewed urgency even before Ings’ goal but Duffy’s immediate reply, nodding Anthony Knockaert’s free-kick down and beyond McCarthy, pepped the visitors’ belief and punctured Saints’ optimism.“After the way we performed in the first half we got away with one,” Murray said. “We were poor, under par, but the second half was a different game.”Locadia and Alireza Jahanbakhsh injected pace, buzzing disconcertingly at the striker’s back, with Jahanbakhsh flicking a shot on to the post. Knockaert, unleashed, tormented his markers and in the end Saints cracked.Hughes, slumped in his dugout, had seen this all before too often. He praised his team’s “progressive approach” and pointed to their initial urgency as evidence they can play with confidence in a stadium where winning has become so elusive. But he was left to bemoan an inability to close out contests “when opponents say: ‘Sod it, let’s throw people forward and take a few risks.’”They had somehow preserved a lead at Crystal Palace in their previous game, McCarthy denying Christian Benteke from point-blank range before the visitors scored a second with virtually the last kick, but that felt like an exception. This late wilt has long since become their norm. That breathing space was always a deception."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2941f2bb53e6909fc05bcdaf43e0074174796d/0_59_3435_2061/master/3435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7ae8ed3673275db5ae21f1c532d582a","title":"tottenham inspiration bale game inter champions league","story":"Tottenham were 4-0 down after 35 minutes against Internazionale at San Siro and the situation was so embarassing even their opponents felt sorry for them.“I was up against Samuel Eto’o, my fellow Cameroonian,” said Sébastien Bassong, who played at centre-half for Spurs that night in 2010, “and I noticed he was steering away from me, he wasn’t running at me. I asked him what he was doing and he said: ‘I don’t want to expose you.’ He was giving me sympathy and pity.”Needless to say, Eto’o’s best intentions went down badly with Bassong but then, as everybody knows, one Tottenham player decided enough was enough. “When Gareth Bale started his show, Eto’o was saying to me: ‘Who is this?’” Bassong said. “He was going crazy, shouting at his defenders: ‘Stop him!’ I said: ’You haven’t seen the half of him.’ Gareth got us out of that mess himself. He was a superhero.”Tottenham are back in Milan for Tuesday night’s opening Champions League game against Inter and ever since the draw the memories of “the Bale game” have framed it.It was the match when a 21-year-old Bale exploded to global prominence with a second-half hat-trick, his second and third goals coming on 90 and 91 minutes. What people do not always remember is that Spurs got on the ball in the 92nd and final minute to hint briefly at 4-4. It did not happen. That would have been too much.The 4-3 defeat has come to be considered almost a victory – influenced, perhaps, by what Bale and Tottenham did next. When Inter visited White Hart Lane for the return, Bale destroyed Maicon, then one of the world’s finest right-backs, and Spurs won 3-1. “Taxi for Maicon,” bellowed the home crowd.“I don’t remember watching the 4-3,” Christian Eriksen said. “But since I joined Tottenham in 2013 I have seen clips of it so many times. It is always being replayed on social media. Hopefully we can make our own memories at the San Siro.”In many ways that game was Spurs’ 2010-11 Champions League campaign in microcosm – Harry Redknapp’s cavaliers were raw, naive, talented and exciting. It was a wild ride, in which anything could and did happen, and it took them all the way to the quarter-finals, where they lost to Real Madrid.“Before the away game against Inter we were a bit shaky – not scared but apprehensive,” Bassong said. “When it started, we just let it go and, at 4-0, it was horrendous. We were not ready mentally to approach such a high-intensity game. Experience plays such a big role and, during the game, you realised the gap between us and the top teams. It’s not something you can explain. You just have to feel it.”The roles have been reversed. Back then Inter were the defending champions and Tottenham the new boys, making their Champions League debut. Now Inter are back in the competition for the first time since 2011 and Spurs, preparing for their third campaign in succession under Mauricio Pochettino, can claim to have the knowhow.In 2010 there was the feeling anything was a bonus for Tottenham but now they are expected to get a result at San Siro and then qualify for the last 16. With Barcelona in their group, the importance of earning some reward is lost on no one.“I think you can put a value on the experience we have gained in the last two seasons,” Eriksen said. “We have learned it is a tough tournament, a tough place to play and learn but a good place.Inter have won only one of their four Serie\u0026nbspA games this season but Tottenham are at a low ebb after consecutive Premier League defeats by Watford and Liverpool. Pochettino continues to lament those results, particularly the one at Watford, when the mentality was wrong, and he made the point again that his team would not be “realistic contenders in any single competition if we show the same face as against Watford”.Pochettino veered into seagulls and trawler territory when he considered the role his players’ greater Champions League experience could play. “It’s like a cow that every single day during 10 years sees the train crossing in front at the same time,” he said. “And if you ask the cow: ‘What time is the train going to come?’ – it’s not going to have the right answer.”What Pochettino meant was that experience in itself was pointless unless the players had learned from it – that they had become hungrier and cleverer in the process.Eriksen said he was simply determined to inspire an upturn at San Siro and heroic failure – like 2010 – would not suffice. “It would be mixed feelings if I scored a hat-trick and we lost.“Personally you might be a bit happy but ultimately you would be disappointed. Hopefully, if I scored a hat-trick in the San Siro, it would mean a win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84b98027754c49e5f77ad86170a8192aea7f9549/0_167_4254_2552/master/4254.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a56c7b8d17efb9a8e0bdc913f1ac260","title":"gaining too much or too little weight in pregnancy could affect babys health","story":"Eating for two is a myth, say researchers, with weight gain linked to insulin resistanceMidwives should be given guidelines on how to advise expectant mothers about managing their weight, their professional body has said, reacting to research that suggested the commonly held belief that pregnant women needed to eat for two was a myth.Gaining too much weight during pregnancy could put the future offspring at an increased risk of insulin resistance and affect their blood pressure in childhood, according to the study published in the journal, Diabetologia.Tam dismissed the idea of expectant mothers “eating for two”. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists note that women do not need extra energy for the first two trimesters and only need an extra 200 calories a day in the last three months of pregnancy.“This research highlights the need for guidelines on weight gain in pregnancy in the UK,” said Mandy Forrester, the head of quality and standards at the Royal College of Midwives. She said that, in the absence of such advice, some British midwives have to “use their own initiative and refer to American guidance”.Forrester added: “There is a clear need for midwives to have the tools, guidance and training they need so that they can offer women the best possible support and care. This is especially pressing because of the potentially serious complications that can arise in pregnancy as a result of women being overweight or obese. It is a real concern that some midwives do not have access to that most basic piece of equipment, scales.”The mention of scales raised the spectre of a return to the weigh-in for expectant mothers. The NHS practice of routinely weighing women during pregnancy was phased out in the early 1990s on the grounds that it caused undue stress for little benefit.In their article, Tam and colleagues described how they followed the health of 905 pairs of mothers and their children in Hong Kong.The mothers’ weight before pregnancy was self-reported and the weight at delivery was taken from medical records, allowing both body mass index and weight gain during pregnancy to be calculated. The women were then classed as either gaining too much, too little, or recommended levels of weight – according to US guidelines – during pregnancy.Between 2009 and 2013, when the children were seven years old, the offspring were examined for measurements including weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure.After taking into account factors including the child’s gender, birthweight and age, maternal glucose levels during pregnancy, mode of delivery, and childhood exercise, the team found that children of women who put on more weight than guidelines recommended during pregnancy were more likely to be heavier, taller and have a higher BMI and waist circumference than offspring of women who gained the recommended levels of weight.They also tended to have a higher blood pressure and signs of greater insulin resistance – factors the team found appeared, at least in part, to be linked to the children’s greater BMI.The effects for children of mothers who gained less weight than recommended during pregnancy were less marked, possibly because there were fewer such children to study and less dramatic deviations from recommended weight gain, but there were some signs that such offspring might also have a slightly increased risk of insulin resistance and higher blood pressure.Tam said the size of the effects were not necessarily cause for alarm and that the study only showed associations, while the children needed to be followed up into adulthood to further explore the effects. The team also noted that the pregnancy weight-gain guidelines were developed for American women, whereas the study involved only women of Chinese ancestry, and weight gain in pregnancy was not measured at multiple points in time. Tam said women needed more support to monitor their weight throughout pregnancy and guidance on recommended levels of weight gain from the outset.Debra Bick, a professor of midwifery and maternal health at King’s College, London, said the focus needed to be on helping women before they become pregnant.“I would advise women planning pregnancy to think about their weight as it can have important life-long consequences for them and their child,” she said.Dr Daghni Rajasingam, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “These findings add to the growing body of evidence that shows the increase in risk of health complications from too much or too little weight gain during pregnancy.“These findings have particular relevance in the UK where one in five pregnant women are obese. Women are encouraged to maintain a healthy weight before, during and after pregnancy by eating a well-balanced diet and taking part in regular exercise. It is also important to avoid dieting during pregnancy, even if a woman is obese, as this may harm the unborn baby.“Having a healthy weight before conception increases the chances of falling pregnant naturally and reduces the risk of pregnancy and birth complications for both mother and baby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46ec5abb890b12e51db082fb71654ed5470f4957/0_0_6847_4109/master/6847.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d41b98b3f4d78d2ce44788de8acb82bb","title":"ofcom to push for regulation of social media platforms","story":"Media regulator’s chief seeks action to prevent online harm Tech companies such as Facebook and Google could be regulated in the same way as the mobile phone and broadband industry, the head of media regulator Ofcom was expected to say on Tuesday.Sharon White was due to outline a potential system regulating social media companies’ in-house complaints processes. Targets would be set for how quickly they removed offensive content and substantial fines issued if they failed to meet these standards. Such a system could be modelled on the existing British method of regulating telecoms companies.“Trust in them is already weakening,” she was expected to say in comments first reported by the . “Our research shows that people see social media platforms as the single biggest source of online harm – and most people want the rules to be tighter.”An Ofcom spokesperson made it clear that the ultimate format of any regulatory system would be a matter for the government.White was expected to describe the current situation, where TV and radio broadcasts are strictly regulated but large swaths of the internet are not, as a “standards lottery”. “As a regulator, we are required to keep audiences safe and protected – irrespective of the screen they watch or the device they hold. Without even knowing it, viewers are watching the same content governed by different regulation in different places or none at all.”Ministers and media industry executives, especially those belonging to newspaper groups, which have felt threatened by the advertising dominance of Facebook and Google, have become increasingly bold in their calls for social media regulation. Their case has been boosted by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and growing public concerns about the impact of harmful social media content on mental health and the quality of public debate.However, those calling for regulation in the UK have often been vague on what form this could actually take, whether it was possible for the UK government to impose controls on global social media companies that have US headquarters and exactly how hands-on the regulation should be.Concerns have been expressed that regulation could close the social media market to new entrants due to the increased cost of doing business, potentially cementing the dominance of the existing market leaders such as YouTube’s owner Google, Twitter and Facebook, which also controls WhatsApp and Instagram. Tech firms have hired tens of thousands of staff in recent years to improve their moderation systems.White’s decision to go public with her proposals reflects the growing willingness of Ofcom – which regulates television, radio and mobile networks – to play a role in shaping the future of internet regulation. Less than a year ago, White expressed doubt over the direct regulation of tech companies because of the “fuzzy boundary with censorship”. Over the past year, however, her language has toughened, culminating in this summer’s more direct warning to the likes of Google and Facebook.The BBC director general, Tony Hall, was also due to give a speech on Tuesday where he will complain that video streaming firms such as Netflix and Amazon have substantially more financial firepower but are not regulated to the same extent as British public service broadcasters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec520c80fa862f4c6f2f81b3c76460769944e3b8/177_266_3759_2256/master/3759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0e516e201bec4165ee80b25cc4b611f","title":"we did it behind the decks at paul oakenfold stonehenge rave","story":"He’s played Everest and the Great Wall of China. So what happened when Oakenfold set out to become the first person ever to DJ at Stonehenge? Our writer grabs his glow stick and heads for the A303Yet here he is, in a business park just off the windy road taken to Basingstoke, dressed in tracksuit bottoms and exuding a surprising degree of nervousness about his next gig. Later today, he will become the first-ever DJ to play at Stonehenge, as the advance publicity has it. In fact, he almost certainly isn’t – someone must have played records between performances by Hawkwind and Gong at the infamous Stonehenge free festivals in the 1970s and 80s. But, technically, those events took place in fields adjacent to the stones, while Oakenfold is doing his stuff right in front of them.Besides, it is the first time English Heritage have officially permitted a live performance at the monument, albeit in front of a select, invited audience of 50, among them actor Andy Serkis and a number of Oakenfold’s peers from the early days of acid house and the “second summer of love”: Danny Rampling, Carl Cox, Terry Farley, Nancy Noise, Mark Moore of S’Express. Moore’s presence underlines Oakenfold’s belief that the event functions as “a celebration of electronic music, club culture as we know it being 30 years old”.The event is the brainchild of Alon Shulman, who is a special adviser to English Heritage, a partner with Oakenfold in a promotions and events company, and the boss of Universe, the promoters behind the vast Tribal Gathering festivals of the 1990s. He says it took a year to organise the event – which serves as an announcement that “Universe is relaunching on the world stage” – as well as being a fundraiser for English Heritage. Once government funded, it is now a charity that needs to reduce its annual subsidy requirement to zero within five years. This is why Oakenfold’s set is to be released as a charity album, while Shulman and the DJ have co-authored a song to commemorate the event, prosaically titled Stonehenge, replete with samples of “sounds from up there – the birdsong and, in the faint distance, cars”.Oakenfold has been preparing for weeks. He proffers what looks like an inflight menu, which is covered in scribbled notes of track titles and timings. “I’ve been in Ibiza, playing music, timing music to sunsets. It’s dramatic, a sunset. How do I build up into it? How can I touch you emotionally? Can I play something you’re shocked by, that makes you go, ‘Oh my God, I can’t believe he’s playing this,’ but then you let it go and say, ‘I understand, because I’m looking at the sunset at Stonehenge’? There are many questions because it’s such a big moment.”For all of his preparation, a degree of apprehension persists. Oakenfold peers out of the hotel window glumly. “You might not be able to see the sunset because a cloud might get in the way, right?” And he frets about whether the team can set everything up in the 35 minutes between Stonehenge closing to the public and the event starting. “We did a rehearsal yesterday,” he frowns. “And that went wrong, to be honest with you.”Still, his nervousness is surprising, because playing Stonehenge is the kind of grandiose gesture of which Oakenfold seems fond. He has DJed on the Great Wall of China, in the middle of a rainforest in Argentina and at Mount Everest’s base camp, an event that sounds as if it would put you off grandiose gestures for life.You could see these events as symbols of a steely ambition that has marked Oakenfold’s career from the time he and four other British DJs returned from a 1987 holiday in Ibiza, where they sampled both ecstasy and the music played at the island’s outdoor club Amnesia – and resolved to create something similar back home. Danny Rampling may have opened Britain’s most celebrated acid house club Shoom, but Oakenfold’s rival night Spectrum was on a far larger scale. Furthermore, he spotted an opportunity for fame buried beneath the nascent scene’s pie-eyed talk of one-love, every-one-together egalitarianism.By his own account, his career really took off when he remixed U2’s Even Better Than the Real Thing – he says his version outsold the original – and was invited to open for them on tour. But his canniest move may have come at the turn of the millennium, when he refocused his attention on the US, and in the process blazed a trail that EDM, the brash US take on dance culture, would follow. “Thanks Paul! Thanks for all of this!” offers the cartoon Calvin Harris in the graphic novel. “Without you and your friends, this whole world wouldn’t exist! There could be no Calvin Harris without Paul Oakenfold!”The graphic novel has a point. Oakenfold was the first DJ to do the kinds of thing that are now very much the sine qua non for EDM stars, including having a residency in Las Vegas and turning his performances into a grand spectacle. “In Vegas,” he says, “we had 50, 60 people doing trapeze acts. There was a show going on, big screens. It moved me on from just DJing and waving my arms about.”Indeed, now that such things are de rigueur, it’s tempting to see Oakenfold’s penchant for big events in unlikely settings as a means of upping the ante, a headline-grabbing way to underline the fact that, when it comes to superstar DJ grandiloquence, he is still the godfather. But no, he says – his reasons for doing them include “good causes, breaking the cycle, pushing electronic music and flying the flag. I’m very proud of being English.” The Stonehenge gig appealed because, “I see the bigger picture. I’m someone who talks to a young demographic worldwide. If I can share with this younger generation that English Heritage is so important, our culture is so important and we need to preserve these iconic places, then so be it.”And with that it’s time to go. Oakenfold’s concerns about the weather are unfounded: it’s a crisp, clear evening and, whether you buy into the mysticism and spirituality of Stonehenge or not, as backdrops for DJ booths go, it is a particularly impressive one. As the coaches disgorge their passengers, it’s difficult to argue that it is anything other than a unique event, although it’s a struggle to find a suitable noun to describe it.Despite the presence of someone handing out glow sticks, you would never call what’s happening a rave. For one thing, the music is broadcast via silent disco-style headphones, due to concern about noise pollution. For another, no one really dances. They wander around the stones, headphones on, taking selfies. Perhaps, were it the late 60s, it might have been called a happening.Meanwhile, the music Oakenfold plays is certainly eclectic. There is a lot of the trance-like electronica for which he’s best known, but there’s also the Weeknd’s Starboy, U2’s Love Is All We Have Left, bits of film soundtracks – Blade Runner, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Gladiator – and the Grid’s old Balearic classic Floatation. As the sun begins to set, the sound of Irish new age folkies Clannad’s 1982 hit Theme from Harry’s Game comes wafting out of my headphones. It sounds fantastic. More unexpected still, it is followed by the sound of Andrea Bocelli singing Nessun Dorma. Oakenfold’s old second summer of love peers seem to be loving it. “I had a bit of a moment in the middle of the stones,” says Moore with a smile.The event is being conducted in more-or-less eerie silence, so the effect is bizarre if you take the headphones off. There are speakers by the DJ booth, but they are turned down so low they’re drowned out by the sound of traffic from the nearby road. The event must look simultaneously spectacular and baffling, not least because it had to be kept secret lest hoards of Oakenfold fans descended. Anyone driving past would see Stonehenge inexplicably lit up in red and blue, with people creeping around a site that English Heritage spends most of the year keeping them a discrete distance away from.As night falls, Oakenfold stands on the small stage, wrapped in a red padded jacket, sharing DJ duties with Cox. Behind him, projections of flames illuminate the stones and bright spotlights strafe the sky. He says something about how life doesn’t get much better than “playing music in the open air at Stonehenge and seeing the joy in the faces of the crowd”. Then he adds: “We did it!” Another grandiose gesture successfully pulled off.

But palm oil cultivation in south-east Asia is clearing forests and contributing to the decline of orangutans. Here are the key points Think back over the past week in your life. If you’ve applied lipstick, eaten toast or put on a load of washing, chances are, you’ve used a product containing palm oil. Indulged in ice-cream or washed your hair? Palm oil. According to the World Wildlife Fund: “It is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket.” And it’s linked to the destruction of the rainforest and many of the species that reside in it.To stop palm oil being listed as “vegetable oil” or as one of a long list of hard to pronounce synonyms, an EU law was passed in 2014, stating that all food products containing palm oil should be labelled clearly. But the same cannot be said for cosmetics and household products in which palm oil is often used.Indonesia is home to some of the most bioerse areas in the world, including the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers, rhinos and sun bears coexist naturally. The Tropical Heritage Rainforest of Sumatra – of which the Leuser ecosystem is a part – is a Unesco world heritage site, but it’s still in danger from palm oil plantations, pulp production and infrastructure projects. Orangutans are keystone species, which, according to National Geographic, means they help define entire ecosystems. If a keystone species – sea otters, elephants, honey bees, for example – disappears, no other species can fill its shoes, and the ecosystem changes irrevocably. Mainstream media now regularly covers palm oil, campaigns such as Say No to Palm Oil have sprung up and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil runs a certification system, which aims to ensure all palm oil with its stamp comes from sustainably managed plantations. Genuine change is yet to occur, however, prompting campaigners to put pressure on brands that use palm oil, urging them to use their power to genuinely reform their suppliers.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

Brussels wants credible assurances from May that any deal will not be unpicked by her successor.The prime minister was only to be given “a few minutes” to talk to leaders at a dinner on Wednesday night in Salzburg before the 27 talk among themselves the following day, in a sign of the low expectation that she will have anything significant to say until after the Conservative party conference.EU diplomats said they feared that the UK government would have to be pushed to the brink of the economic disaster before it does move on the most contentious issues.“A lot of movement is needed by the UK side before we can actually reach agreement”, said one senior diplomat. “We need a substantial change in the UK red lines still.”A second EU diplomat added: “It seems that the UK needs to have a ‘darkest hour’ moment before they will shift position. But they will have to shift their position.”The EU is insistent that it would not soften its stance that the UK needs to sign up to a Northern Ireland specific “backstop” solution, ensuring there was no hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit in any circumstances.The principle that Northern Ireland should in effect stay in the customs union and single market to avoid a hard border, should no other solution be available, has not been rethought.The Irish cabinet was expected to discuss contingency planning for border controls between Britain and Ireland in the event of there being no deal, at a meeting on Tuesday. The Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, was meeting Michel Barnier to confirm their solidarity.Just hours before flying to Brussels, Coveney issued a statement urging the UK to change its tack in talks and warning time was running out.He said it was vital that UK negotiators started engaging on the issue of the “backstop”, which would operate as a guarantee of no hard border in the event talks collapse or if another government not opposed to a hard border in Northern Ireland was elected.“I will be making very clear our continued strong support for Michel Barnier, welcoming his approach on efforts to de-dramatise the backstop aimed at agreeing the text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland,” he said.“Time is short and it is important that the UK delivers on its commitments and engages constructively with the EU’s proposed backstop. The EU has been clear that without an agreement on a backstop, there cannot be an agreement on the withdrawal agreement”. Brussels was also adamant that the Chequers proposals on a common rule book and customs arrangement do not go far enough in respecting the integrity of the EU.EU diplomats said that ambiguous “language” in the political declaration on the future deal could be found to paper over some of the differences between the EU and UK, to allow them to be dealt with after Brexit.But they have warned that the chasm between the two sides as yet remains too large in key areas for any such compromise vision to be realised.The French official insisted, however, that while the political declaration was not legally binding, its terms should be clear and that they would be held to by the EU during the trade deal negotiations in the possible 21-month transition period after Brexit.The sources added, of the Irish backstop, that it was “something of a life insurance for the Irish border … If there is no backstop accord for the Irish border, there is no Brexit accord”.A diplomat from another member state said: “If you look at the Chequers proposals which have some elements in it that we support – external security, internal security – these are fine.“Chequers had some other aspects that are more difficult. So the technical customs arrangement they proposed I think is too difficult to put into practice.“There is work necessary to find language to express in this political agreement on the future relationship which meets up the four freedoms of the internal market and at same time satisfies the position of the UK, and that of course plays into the backstop discussion on Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0e22fe87ae2e40e128a51d7d50b1cc790f0889/425_264_4819_2891/master/4819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4c4a9ba5e62f19b951b33d4d5e89717","title":"ecb hundred format success twist t20 road test trent bridge","story":"The Hundred, eh? After a couple of low-key pilot matches at an empty Trent Bridge in mid‑September it is possible to report back that the ECB’s funky new format is, to all intents and purposes, still cricket.Indeed, beyond a handful of tweaks – one of which seemed OK and some others that required a touch of mental de-programming (even if the pre-converted are not the targeted new audience) – The Hundred differs little from Twenty20 as a short, sharp event. Should this news, after months of gimmicks being floated, provoke a sigh of relief? Or does it in fact raise the question of whether a fourth cricketing format is required at all?Whatever one’s perspective, the fact is that from 2020 onwards eight newly created teams will be competing in a five-week mid‑summer window as part of a £1.1bn broadcast deal in which 10 of the 36 men’s matches will be aired live on BBC Two. To make the latter happen, and as a secondary consideration allow families to get the little ones home at a reasonable hour, the England and Wales Cricket Board feels it must crunch Twenty20 down into two and a half hours and thus come some of the changes witnessed on Monday.During the matches played, between two sides of county pros notionally called North and South, an ability to forget some of the fundamentals was required. Chiefly this was that overs are a now thing of the past. It is all about balls.There are 100 per innings and these are sent down in blocks of 10. Bowlers deliver five at a time and 20 in total. They can bowl 10 in a row – an entire 10-ball block, if deemed tactically correct – or four lots of five. A bowler can also bowl 10 either side of a change of ends. As the balls count down from 100 on the scorecard, the runs go up. In the first game the North, captained by the former England all-rounder Samit Patel, beat the South by nine runs in two hours and 17 minutes (job done).Patel’s men posted 137 for seven from their 100 balls but the South roared back, smashing 66 from 25 balls (the first 20 of which were the powerplay) via the flashing blades of Warwickshire’s Ed Pollock and the giant Essex all-rounder Paul Walter.But then came another innovation, with a strategic 2min 30sec time-out called that allowed their bowling coach, Nottinghamshire’s Andy Pick, on to the field. Patel regrouped his men and from there the South collapsed to 128 all out with eight balls remaining, the sometime Leicestershire off-spinner Rob Sayer picking up four.Along the way there was another notable difference. When Billy Root of Notts was caught in the North’s first innings, for example, the batsmen had crossed. But here the new man in had to face the next ball (even if coming the ball before a change of ends). Though overriding Law 18.12.2 – something that Daryl Mitchell, the PCA chairman, later revealed may be changed for all cricket by MCC down the line – this was the one innovation that seemed not entirely unreasonable.As Trent Woodhill, the Australian freelance coach who is advising the ECB, explained: “The bowlers play such a massive part in the sport and there’s got to be reward for when they do something well – that’s bowling to the new batsman.”Though Patel did not agree – “I’m a batter. If you cross, you cross” – he did enjoy the time-out from which the collapse ensued, even if he was keen to point out that it was his tactics – rather than any input from Pick – that made the difference.Another interesting decision came in whether to stick with a bowler for all 10 balls of a block or switch. In the case of spinners he felt it was easy to decide. Seamers, on the other hand, should have a greater say in whether they can go the distance. If the fifth ball of a block was hit for six, Patel said he felt compelled to change bowler regardless. His overall take? “It was pretty good, actually. You don’t feel any difference from a T20 game really. I wonder why we can’t stick with T20 but we’ve been told to give it a crack. I’m sure different rules and regs may come in but, so far, I think it’s been pretty good.”While the first match was a thriller – or as close as you will get with an audience of 16,000 plastic seats and the odd ECB employee – the second was a damp squib, with the South rolled for 104 in 92 balls, which the North chased down in 77 with four wickets down.This was day four of six pilot days and aspects like powerplays and substitutes will continue to be tweaked before sign-off in November. But overall it appears the ECB feels the new audience will be unlocked by playing them cricket’s equivalent of the radio edit. For those who prefer the 12-inch version, it will take some getting used to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6e3ce6d7ee57f285feafb21918fee373f02781e/69_366_3092_1854/master/3092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=311d50ef06395f49b2cf6c7ff88db798","title":"lpga tour mixed events female golf prize money mike whan commissioner","story":"The prospect of golf’s leading men and women competing in the same event is edging closer, according to the head of the LPGA Tour, who confirmed talks are taking place with his equivalents at men’s tours on both sides of the Atlantic. Mike Whan also said the concept of women professionals earning identical sums to men is not fanciful.Whan, who has been the LPGA Tour commissioner since 2010, has been in detailed discussions with Jay Monahan of the PGA Tour and the European Tour’s Keith Pelley as golf seeks to boost interest levels with mixed events. Options including full and smaller field events, plus mixed pairs competitions, are being\u0026nbspassessed.“Jay and I have talked about it, trying to figure out an event where the PGA and the LPGA play together, and I have had the same conversations with Keith,” Whan said. “Not only is it just a good thing to do – unique and fun – but, if you ask our young superstars, they are excited about it. If you ask our fans, they want to see it.“Whenever you talk to the media they say, ‘If that event happens, I’m going.’ So there is nothing wrong with a sport saying something that intrigues our fans, our athletes and our media is worth figuring out.“We have a subcommittee alongside the PGA Tour that is working on different format ideas. The challenge for both of us is we have full schedules and there are logistical issues, but both sides are committed to something to give fans and players something exciting to lift attention.”Brittany Lincicome, a leading member of the LPGA Tour, featured on the PGA Tour in July in a special exemption case. “I think more people talked about Brittany in one week than at any of the majors she won,” Whan said. “It creates a curiosity factor that is healthy.”“I absolutely can see that. I don’t know if I’ll see it in my time as commissioner but I think it will happen in a couple of phases. I think there will be a tournament that, economics aside, will say this is a statement it wants to make. Someone will want to be the first one to do that, then once one or two do it, you’ll see a few more follow.”The tour as inherited by Whan was in stark trouble because of economic pressures. It was, as the commissioner recalls, “in a hole”. External improvements subsequently helped, of course, but so did a back-to-basics approach.“I think we are the only sport in the world where, when the athlete signs up for a tournament, the first thing she gets is a card explaining who is the title sponsor, what are their objectives this week, what things the title sponsor hopes you say when you have a microphone in your face,” Whan said. “There are pictures of the most important cheque writers that you will see this week so that, when you see them, thank them and there is usually a mailing address. We ask players to do one handwritten thank-you card a week, just thanking the person who has made that event possible.“They are pretty basic things. I feel pretty comfortable saying there is no more customer-centric group of athletes in the world than players on the LPGA Tour. Word quickly spread that the athletes were engaged. It wasn’t just about hanging a sign on a tee box.”An intriguing subplot relates to the growing Asian influence on the LPGA Tour and coincided with Whan’s arrival. “I could just tell, between players and board members, staff and a load of partners it was really uncomfortable. They looked at me and said: ‘What are you going to do about this?’ – as if I was going to put a road block up. I told them two words: ‘Embrace it’.”The LPGA scenario contrasts starkly with that of the Ladies European Tour, which has been beset by bad publicity because of a lack of scheduled events. Whan earlier offered essentially to take over the LET but was rebuffed. “It wasn’t because I wasn’t being selfish – I was,” he said. “I want to make sure that great European Tour players not only have a place to play but also have a place to aspire to. Without a lot of Europeans on our tour the LPGA is not as strong.“I think the idea of a) us running it, it becoming a LPGA Tour and b)\u0026nbsptheir top players having a direct pass to the LPGA ... they didn’t really love either of those things. I don’t necessarily understand those concerns but I respect them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc0539ec6caa40796d1fc74333e79dd3da0e8cef/0_192_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a40f3a69edd663336543c4b6be8757f1","title":"sub two hour marathon not fanciful eliud kipchoge","story":"Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge finished the Berlin Marathon in 2hr 1min 39sec on Sunday but advances in shoe technology, carbohydrate drinks and mindsets may close the gap furtherWhen Eliud Kipchoge woke to a dazzling Monday morning in Berlin he was greeted with global headlines lauding him as a “long-distance Usain Bolt” and “the fastest man in the world”. No wonder, given that he had just “pulverised” – as Marca put it – the marathon world record by\u0026nbsp78\u0026nbspseconds.According to Die Welt, the Kenyan had also performed another feat of wizardry by contradicting the late Czech runner Emil Zatopek, in 1954 the first man to break the 29‑minute barrier in the 10,000m and a visionary who famously said that “fish float, birds fly, and humans run”. The paper insisted: “The 33-year-old did not run. He flew to a new world best.”As Kipchoge soared across the line in 2hr\u0026nbsp01min\u0026nbsp39sec, even sober minds began to entertain the fantastical. His time, after all, was just 100sec from the holy grail of distance running: the sub-two-hour marathon. Suddenly the pipe dream did not look so potty.Certainly Kipchoge, who ran 2:00.25 in Monza last year as part of the Nike Breaking2 project – although it did not count under official rules as pacers were subbed in and out of the race – thinks it is possible. “It is not rocket science to break this barrier,” he insisted. “You simply have to believe in it. And you need a great team that believes in it and in you, the perfect shoes, and to be stronger than any runner before. Then everything is possible.”Intriguingly, some scientists agree. “It is now a significant step closer,” says Dr Michael Joyner, an expert in human performance at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. “We might see something like a Tiger Woods effect – when he arrived on the golfing scene he was a quantum leap forward, yet eventually there was a catch-up.”Joyner, who wrote an academic paper 27 years ago suggesting that it was physiologically possible to run a 1:58 marathon, says that if more athletes concentrate on the distance earlier in life it could also make a difference. “There was an 18‑year‑old Ethiopian who ran the 5,000m in 12:43 last month,” he says. “That’s 10 seconds faster than Mo Farah’s personal best. What might he do over 26.1 miles in a few years?”Others, however, are more sceptical. The highly respected sports scientist Dr Ross Tucker believes that sub-two is “probably at least 15-20 years away” although there is a substantial caveat. He is unsure how much improved shoe technology and science helped Kipchoge – and how future tech boosts could further improve times.On Sunday Kipchoge’s manager, Jos Hermans, cited another factor – an energy drink made by the Swedish company Maurten. Not only does it contain more carbohydrates than other such drinks but, crucially, it also forms a hydrogel when it reaches the stomach – thus supplying more energy during a marathon without causing gastrointestinal problems.“So is that the shoe? The carb‑drink? The mindset? I am not sure,” says Tucker. “But if it is the first two then the sub-two is a lot closer than you would think. Because all it will take is a similar step-up in technology as we have seen in recent years.“However if technology is not a massive factor, then a sub-two is a lot further away because the physiology of humans isn’t going to change as quickly.”A lot depends on how much of a phenomenon Kipchoge is. Remember Paula Radcliffe’s women’s marathon record was set in 2003 yet still stands today.Meanwhile Mark Burnley, a sport scientist at the University of Kent who specialises in high performance, says the “big\u0026nbspthree” physiological parameters of VO2max, lactate threshold and running economy remain the biggest limiting factors in going under two hours.Burnley says that critical speeds of just over 21km per hour are possible in 10,000m athletes, which is sub-two-hour pace, but it places a severe strain on their carbohydrate reserves and the probability of hitting the wall is very high.For Kipchoge, however, walls are something over which to joyously leap. “No human is limited,” he says. “Everything is possible, and records are there to be broken.” Yes, even his remarkable one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d68589cf55a821dec850f052a8f967569d9eae5e/0_178_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e70d58c51b65383df140b8162fd84dfb","title":"lewis hamilton singapore sergio perez","story":"A weekend that had begun with such optimism for Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari ended with the team and driver bearing the demeanour of the defeated. They should have done better. Vettel had hit the wall in FP2, ending his session. He insisted it made no difference to his preparation but crucially second practice was the only one run in exactly the same night conditions as qualifying. Lewis Hamilton pointedly noted that small events have ramifications and he was right. The race might have been different had Vettel been on pole but, forced to go aggressive, Ferrari’s strategy failed. The undercut did not work, he hit traffic and he was on the wrong tyre – losing second to Max Verstappen. The title looks as if it has gone and the Scuderia increasingly appear to need a comprehensive overhaul. Vettel can deliver but he needs the car and sharp minds on the pit wall that have been missing of late.Hamilton has put in some extraordinary performances to take the 40-point lead he now enjoys over Vettel. He has been open in his desire to improve his qualifying and he proved in the wet in Hungary and Belgium just how well it has gone. But nothing has quite demonstrated his mastery of the single lap as the run in Singapore. Mercedes had done well to improve their car’s performance on what was considered a bogey track for the team but nothing prepared them for where Hamilton took their machinery. Pete Bonnington, his race engineer, summed up the remarkable reaction in the garage as Hamilton pumped in a series of unprecedented sector times. “You were impressed by the silence,” he said. “There wasn’t a lot of jumping. It was a lot of jaws hitting the floor, to see a gap like that.” The superlatives flowed deservedly and bear repeating – this was a driver on a different level altogether.Perhaps overshadowed by Hamilton’s superlative weekend, Max Verstappen put in a performance to remind everyone of just how good he can be when his judgment is spot on. He was suffering with engine mapping problems all weekend but drove an exceptional lap to take second on the grid, three-tenths up on Vettel. In the race he matched it. Vettel came at him off the start and, when the German made a superb move round the outside of turn seven on the opening lap, there was no clumsy defence. Verstappen gave him just enough room to make it and to Vettel’s credit he did. The Dutchman stayed focused, however, and pumped in the laps to ensure he was in front again after his pitstop. With track position he flew ahead and secured a fine second place. This was the performance that underlines his potential future world champion credentials and a world away from biffing Valtteri Bottas at Monza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cebd286b9ef50e8647c874c093aad8373a74aae/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab3c66eaf7281f5759c7cacd4e91fee5","title":"british diver vernon unsworth sues elon musk over pedo claim","story":"Vernon Unsworth files lawsuit in LA seeking damages after row over Thai cave rescueA British er who helped rescue young football players trapped in a Thai cave is suing the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, for defamation.Vernon Unsworth alleges that Musk falsely accused him on Twitter of being a paedophile. A lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court seeks at least $75,000 (£57,000) in damages and a court order preventing Musk from making further allegations, while Unsworth is also bringing action in the English and Welsh courts.Musk called Unsworth, who was instrumental in the successful rescue operation, a “pedo” after the er criticised him in a television interview. Musk and SpaceX engineers built a small submarine and shipped it to Thailand to help with the cave rescue. The device was not used and Unsworth called it a PR stunt.The er alleges in his complaint that Musk later accused him of moving to Thailand to be with a bride who was about 12 years old. Unsworth says Musk “embarked on a PR campaign to destroy” his reputation after becoming angry at an interview he gave to the US television network, CNN.Unsworth had told the broadcaster that Musk’s device “had absolutely no chance of working”, that Musk “had no conception of what the cave passage was like” and that Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts”.The er accuses Musk of “publishing false and heinous accusations of criminality against him to the public”. In the court filing, seen by the , he adds that Musk posted a series of tweets directed at Unsworth on 15 July, calling his claims about the submarine into question and adding: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.”The complaint notes that Musk deleted the tweets and posted two more that “purported to be an apology” three days later.Lawyers for Unsworth wrote to Musk threatening to sue on 6 August, though Musk publicly claimed about two weeks later that no such action had been taken. “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? “ he tweeted in response to another user.The complaint says: “Musk’s 28 August tweet conveyed to the average reader that Mr Unsworth’s failure to sue him was evidence that Mr Unsworth is, in fact, a pedophile and guilty of the most heinous crimes.” That accusation was followed by a host of further similar allegations in an email from Musk to a reporter at Buzzfeed, which Unsworth’s lawyers argue are also untrue.“Instead of retracting his false accusations and ceasing his campaign to impugn Mr Unsworth, Musk publicly stated, ‘I fucking hope he sues me,’” the US complaint says.On Monday, Unsworth’s lawyer in the US, Lin Wood said: “Musk’s influence and wealth cannot … protect him from accountability for his wrongdoing in a court of law.”“Elon Musk is being brought to account for repeatedly attacking and taunting the good name of an ordinary spelunker, Vernon Unsworth, who answered the call and, with others, put his life on the line to help rescue the 13 trapped in the caves in Thailand. I still carry the light of hope that Mr Musk will withdraw his baseless allegations and properly vindicate Mr Unsworth.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd2b52239fd1ea019239723d64bd9c93f41669c/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5270ee774b9147d485734a11cc2657c9","title":"instagram is supposed to be friendly so why is it making people so miserable","story":"For a growing number of users and mental health experts, the positivity of Instagram is precisely the problem, with its relentless emphasis on promoting ‘perfect’ lifestyles. Should everyone just stop scrolling?When 24-year-old fashion blogger Scarlett Dixon posted a picture of herself having breakfast, the internet turned nasty. “The best of days start with a smile and positive thoughts. And pancakes. And strawberries. And bottomless tea,” Dixon wrote on her scarlettlondon Instagram feed, under an image of her looking flawless on a freshly made bed flanked by heart-shaped helium balloons.The sponsored post – for Listerine mouthwash, a bottle of which is visible on the side of the shot – was swiftly reposted on Twitter. “Fuck off this is anybody’s normal morning,” wrote Nathan from Cardiff. “Instagram is a ridiculous lie factory made to make us all feel inadequate.” His post, which has garnered more than 111,000 likes (22 times as many as Dixon’s original) and almost 25,000 retweets, prompted a wave of criticism, with the more printable comments ranging from “Fakelife!” and “Bunny-boiler” to “Let’s pop her balloons” and “Who keeps Listerine on their bedside table? Serial killers, that’s who.”That hostility feels par for the course on Twitter. The social network is a notorious hotbed of abusive strangers hurling abuse at other abusive strangers, who then all occasionally come together to bully a celebrity off the internet over some minor failing, such as being a woman in a Star Wars film. Instagram, by contrast, looks like the friendliest social network imaginable. It’s a visually led community where the primary method of interaction is double-tapping an image to like it, where posts that go viral tend to do so because of positivity rather than outrage and where many of the biggest accounts are famous dogs and cats. What’s not to like?But, for a growing number of users – and mental health experts – the very positivity of Instagram is precisely the problem. The site encourages its users to present an upbeat, attractive image that others may find at best misleading and at worse harmful. If Facebook demonstrates that everyone is boring and Twitter proves that everyone is awful, Instagram makes you worry that everyone is perfect – except you.In the days following her initial Instagram post, Dixon pointed out the irony that this fear – that the unreality of social media is harming people – was itself being used to justify the thousands attacking her.“Each time I refresh my page, hundreds of new nasty messages pour on to my Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, some of which have contained malicious death threats,” she wrote in a follow-up Instagram post, accompanying a picture of her in Venice with an ice-cream. “There are now hundreds of thousands of tweets circling the internet, shaming me.”“My feed isn’t a place of reality,” Dixon added. “I mean who spends their time in such a beautiful city, perched on a ledge, ice-cream in hand and smile permanently affixed to her face? It’s staged, guys.“I personally don’t think my content is harmful to young girls, but I do agree Instagram can present a false expectation for people to live up to.”But whether or not Dixon’s feed is harmful, there is growing support for the idea that Instagram isn’t great for its users’ mental health.In 2017, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), an independent charity that seeks to improve people’s wellbeing, conducted a UK-wide survey of 14- to 24-year-olds, asking them about the big five social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram. Users ranked how their use of the platforms affected everything from the quality of their sleep to their Fomo – the fear of missing out on what others are enjoying.Instagram came last, scoring particularly badly for its effects on sleep, body image and Fomo. Only Snapchat came close in its overall negativity, saved by a more positive effect on real-world relationships, while YouTube scored positively on almost every metric – except its effect on sleep, for which it was the worst of all the platforms.“On the face of it, Instagram can look very friendly,” says the RSPH’s Niamh McDade. “But that endless scrolling without much interaction doesn’t really lead to much of a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing. You also don’t really have control over what you’re seeing. And you quite often see images that claim to be showing you reality, yet aren’t. That’s especially damaging to young men and women.”The risk of developing an unhealthy body image is often highlighted, but McDade emphasises that this is just one aspect. “Some people may be looking at feeds full of cars, and it’s giving them anxiety and depression as they can’t afford them.”For Stephen, a 24-year-old from London, the unreality led him to develop unhealthy behaviours online. “I was going through a bit of heartbreak at the time,” he says, “and any experience of seeing my ex’s name on Instagram killed me. I was pretty down and found myself predominantly using Instagram to either ‘punish’ myself by looking at my ex, or using the browse feature to distract me. I found myself looking at attractive women a lot when they’d come up in the browse feature, which would then cause more to be shown.“The problem with Instagram is that you, almost exclusively, share content that is meant to reflect positively on yourself,” he says. “On Twitter or Facebook, you see much more content that isn’t, ‘Hey, look at my great life.’”Almost every user adds fuel to the flames. Even as we’re being made miserable by the unreal lives that we follow, we share an unreal version of our own lives. “I have been on Instagram since 2013 and in the beginning I enjoyed it,” says Adnan, a 25-year-old Syrian who lives in Cape Town. “But, as the years passed, it changed from being a friendly environment, where most people posted food pictures, into a competitive social platform where everyone filters out their lives to represent a life that does not exist. Nobody looks good all the time, nobody is always happy. When things get tough, I get really upset when I see other people having the ‘perfect’ life.” And yet, Adnan says, “I am also guilty of trying to show the best side of my life to people.”But Instagram has always been about looking flawless. What has changed to spark such a backlash? Among users I spoke to, one event was cited time and again: the introduction, in mid-2016, of Instagram’s algorithmic timeline. It was one of the largest changes to the platform since it was bought by Facebook in 2012. Rather than presenting users with a cross-section of what the people they were following were up to at any given moment, Instagram began populating feeds with the most noteworthy posts from those accounts, often reaching back days or even weeks to pull in particularly compelling content. In effect, the service began promoting a curated, unrealistic version of an already curated, unrealistic feed.Talya Stone, a parenting blogger at Motherhood: The Real Deal, went cool on Instagram shortly afterwards. “For a long time, Instagram was one of the only places where the interaction felt real,” she says. “Then the algorithm came along and blew that out of the water. The whole point of these social platforms is that they are supposed to enhance social connectivity – yet, bizarrely, they are based on an algorithm that seems to be working against this very notion.”Victoria Hui, who runs the lifestyle blog the Lust Listt, says there is another issue affecting “pro” Instagram users – those who make a living (or hope to) from advertising and sponsorship. “The new algorithm creates a popularity contest between creators, so that they resort to unethical business decisions in order to keep themselves at the top of the food chain.”Unscrupulous creators started buying followers, likes and comments in an attempt to fool the algorithm as Instagram clamped down on that, Hui says, those users formed secret “comment pods” conspiring to share “each and every post with each other in order to generate ‘authentic’ and immediate engagement”.While influencers such as Dixon often get the lion’s share of the blame for the epidemic of unreality on Instagram, it’s just as prevalent at the grassroots as it is among the “Insta-celebrities”.I stopped using the app earlier this year, when I realised that I reliably felt worse after opening it than I did before I started. But my Instagram – a locked account, with just a couple of hundred followers and posts – is almost exclusively for keeping in touch with people I got to know in other ways. The closest I get to following influencers is the pop star Carly Rae Jepsen and an Instagram-famous husky.Still, every time I open the app, I’m presented with an endless feed of my friends and family doing incredible things, having a wonderful time, without me.There’s the friend whose wedding I wasn’t invited to I found out about it through the app. There’s the friend who is looking fantastic after every workout and lets us all know. And there’s the friend who lives in New York, apparently over in London for the weekend without telling me.Meanwhile, I’m doing nothing of note – except sitting on Instagram. At least I don’t suffer the same from the adverts. Because of a glitch in my privacy settings, Instagram believes I am a Bangkok teenager and serves me nothing but adverts written in Thai for acne cures and KFC. This is not a joke.When I tell friends about my dissatisfaction with the app, their responses are mixed. Some cite conventional wisdom, telling me to unfollow the influencers with a commercial imperative to sell me a perfect life and devote the app to keeping up with the friends I care about. Rob, for instance, follows “fewer than 100 people, all family and friends”.But I don’t follow any influencers, and the friends I care about most are the ones most likely to create that familiar pang of Fomo.Others offer exactly the opposite advice, arguing that my problem is not following enough influencers. I should focus less on using Instagram to find out what people I care about are doing and more on using it as a source of information and inspiration. One friend, Lynsey, cites Present and Correct, which sells exquisitely designed office supplies, as her go-to happy place. Another, Marie, recommends her personal mix of “roughly one-third friends, one-third MPs and one-third drag queens”.It’s true that there is a whole world of information best communicated in a visual medium. While some fitness-focused Instagrams leave you feeling like a fat blob of plasticine, others are sources of useful advice, laser-targeted at people in your situation.But I’ve tried that version of Instagram, too, and I worry that it provides only a veneer of engagement, while forever hovering on the precipice of impossibly perfect breakfasts eaten by impossibly perfect people. Even Facebook, Instagram’s owner, warns against using its products in this way. “In general,” the company wrote on its corporate blog last year, “when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information – reading but not interacting with people – they report feeling worse afterward”.Of course, Facebook’s answer was that everyone should post more. But it would say that, wouldn’t it? Another option is to follow the guidance of the RSPH. As part of “scroll-free September” the charity is encouraging users to aim for anything between complete cold turkey and simply stopping at certain times, such as in the bedroom or during meals.There is one final possibility, proposed by a few others when I shared my own Insta-woes: don’t give up on Instagram, just give up on people.There are enough dogs, cats, birds, otters and ferrets to fill a social network of their own – from Jiro the otter to Gotcha the cockatoo – and it’s very hard to scroll through pet Instagram and feel bad about yourself.Though you may start wishing for a more photogenic labradoodle.For more information and advice on issues with social media, go to the RSPH: rsph.org.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049ab09ba055deeed1a7129366e1999c9d411c96/21_168_3982_2390/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b4874f54773893d41a3acf59ff2342","title":"black earth rising recap episode two is anyone safe","story":"There’s a big twist this week that rivals Bodyguard in terms of shock value. In the aftermath, Kate comes to the fore but is facing up to an uncertain futureEpisode two of Hugo Blick’s series is mostly owned by Michaela Coel’s Ashby, who gets to show all the facets of her complex, prickly, vulnerable character - resourceful, mordant, lacking in social filter, terrified. But for all of her tough carapace, not only is she groping in the dark for much of this episode but she as yet doesn’t quite realise just how much in the dark she truly is. And her sense of loneliness is exacerbated by the shocking, grisly highlight of the episode.First up, we’re at The Hague. Godwin Hall, Eve Ashby’s assistant is looking round the empty courtroom. A somewhat sinister usher, standing behind the thick glass of the public gallery above him, tries to impress upon him the grandeur of the place. “Impressive, isn’t it?” he asks. “Depends who wins,” shrugs Godwin.The court is in session. By now, we’ve guessed that an attack is in the offing. Two men pass through security at the moment the x-ray machine picks up their guns, a woman nearby conveniently vomits violently, distracting the staff, allowing them to walk through unmolested. They take their place in thew public gallery as Eve Ashby announces to the judge that she intends to submit evidence about Nyamoya outside of the court’s mandate but which will establish a “predisposition of character” on his part. It’s contained in a package “The one thing he thought we’d all forget”, she tells Nyamoya’s team.The two men are joined unexpectedly in the gallery by a school party. The younger man blinks nervously their assassination mission is aborted. They get back in the car with their driver, the older man castigating his partner for his squeamishness. A highway patrol officer watches their car pass by.Outside the court room, Eve and Godwin happen to set eyes on Nyamoya as he is standing in a holding cage waiting to be driven away. They exchange words and it seems like we’re about to learn something “my daughter deserves -” when a shot rings out and Eve is hit. The highway patrol officer is an assassin. Nyamoya is handcuffed, trapped - he is shot dead where he stands. The gunman kills Godwin also. It’s not Bodyguard-shocking, but shocking all the same to lose a character like Harriet Walter’s so early. And dead she is - we are not spared the brain parts nestling in the puddle of blood oozing from her head.Numb yet composed in her grief at the morgue, Kate reveals to the mortician that though her mother still wears her wedding ring, her father died a long time ago. A news item reveals the aftermath of the shooting, with the two would-be assassins and their driver now added to the bodycount, dispatched by the same man, Mr Plan B, who killed Eve and Nyamoya.Following a call to Eunice Taylor in the US, Alice Munezero, former general in the Tutsi army, arrives in the UK for Eve’s funeral. She knows Michael well, it seems - they meet at the bedside of Michael’s daughter but the story of how they met they tell Harper feels concocted. Alone, they converse obliquely. “So - is it all set up?” asks Alice.At Eve’s funeral, Kate delivers a gauche, blunt eulogy in which she says that Eve was “not my mother”. She meant to convey “more than that” but it doesn’t quite come across and Alice wonders to Michael if she is entirely reliable. Later, Alice and Kate meet and she hands him a copy of a photo of her, Michael, Even and her father Ed, who we learned died in a plane crash a week after rescuing Kate from the orphanage. Shortly afterwards, Alice is met by police and arrested. She has been expecting them. This is what had been set up.In the back of a car, Kate pops tablets as Michael looks on sympathetically. He drinks, a lot, he reveals. We later see him piss blood. He tells a confused Kate that to her mother, Nyamoya was not the national hero he seemed but that maybe she saw prosecuting him as a “destination, not a bridge”. Kate is further shocked, as is the British judge, when Alice agrees to be extradited to France on a war crimes charge - killing a French priest. Michael explains to Kate that she just wants to get the case sorted once and for all but it’s like he’s holding something back, even as it’s clear he wants to take Kate more under his wing - each a replacement fatherdaughter to the other.After Alice appears before a French magistrate, Kate is dispatched to meet the witnesses, as well as one Jacques Barré, advisor to the Elysée Palace in the run-up to 1994, whose family made their pile in rubber. It was he who encouraged the dead priest’s mother to seek a prosecution. He refuses to apologise for advising the French to back the “democratically elected” Hutu government and has no qualms about apportioning some blame for the genocide on the minority Tutsis and their invading army. Kate is visibly offended.She makes two further calls - on the Hutu doctor at the refugee camp, who she tricks into giving her the number of his contact, a member of the French Secret Service. When she visits the second witness, the Tutsi lieutenant, at a compound, he gives her short shrift and warns that if she knows about the secret service officer, he will know about her.Shortly afterwards, she takes a swim at her hotel pool, only for an unseen hand to trigger the automatic shutter, trapping her in the water she only just escapes alive. Back in the changing room, she slithers through an air vent in search of her assailant, only to hallucinate - an animated sequence in which a hand reaches down and rescues her - dropping back into the changing room where the word “STOP” has been written into the condensation on the shower door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5201d1ddd63e1e6978fa7161dee3721bc0c3349/0_286_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8966a98fe1fc5cbd93bd123566975414","title":"monkman seagull genius guide britain","story":"The Cambridge college captains hit the road on an unchallenging journey of learning that lacks one vital ingredient: funWas University Challenge always as much of a talking point as it is now? Thanks to the power of watch-along social media, the 56-year-old quizshow has become a temporary star-maker, bringing brief flashes of attention to its more idiosyncratic contestants, though female participants still have to weather a running commentary on their appearance before we get to their brains. None were more prominent than Bobby Seagull and Eric Monkman, captains of rival Cambridge college teams in the 2017 competition, who were lauded for their lightning-fast brains and quirky ways, and then became best friends. They have made the most of a partnership that is, in Twitter hyperbole, “iconic”, teaming up to host a Radio 4 show about polymaths and publishing a book, which no doubt featured questions that were a cut above your average pub-quiz picture round.This show is another attempt to harness the power of the Monkmania brand (poor Seagull, having a name that is so hard to riff on – Seagull-timate Warrior?). The unlikely lads – “no ordinary tourists”, though they look quite a lot like ordinary tourists – are sent off on a tour of Britain to find out about inventions and the history of engineering, as told through the stories of local curiosities. They start in Blackpool, to try out Sir Hiram Maxim’s Captive Flying Machine, a ride built in 1904 to simulate flying, in order to raise funds for Maxim’s attempts to build a non-attached flying machine, which, of course, did not succeed. Monkman explains centrifugal force with the muted enthusiasm of someone far too bright to be explaining the basics of centrifugal force, but nevertheless, he is very charming about it.They move on, to Southport, to visit the British lawnmower museum, which was a missed opportunity for it all to go a bit Sightseers, but allowed Brian, who showed them in, to use two lawn-based puns in barely a second. Then, via a detour to Britain’s tallest tower, the mast at Emley Moor, they end up at Jodrell Bank, marvelling at the power of the observatory’s design and power. For a show that has genius in the title, it didn’t impart a great deal of wisdom, and seemed too skittish to stay in one place for long enough to throw out the truly nerdy facts and explanations that this could have taken. I wanted diagrams, re-enactments, something along the lines of Drunk History – with a little bit of brainy swagger.One of Monkman and Seagull’s attempts to work out the height of the mast involved reading a sign that explained how far the lift travelled in a minute, and then noting how long it took for the lift to get to the top, and working it out from there. I am the proud holder of a hard-earned B-grade GCSE in single science. Even I might have figured that one out.But it isn’t really a How Stuff Works affair. Those shows are spectacles that tend to revel in the whiz-bang of showy experiments, and they usually involve chucking two explosive things together to explain, you know, physics and stuff. This was more of a travelogue, with a few facts thrown in, and a deep appreciation of the awkward moments that arise when Monkman and Seagull drive themselves around the UK.There were Alan Bennett touches here and there, such as when it came to Monkman’s need to break the silence of a long drive by offering biscuits, more than once. The two of them exploring a museum built in a phone box, clearly uncomfortable with their proximity to one another, was held for an extended beat that wouldn’t have seemed out of place in The Office. Their warmth and appeal came from their relationship to one another, rather than them pretending to read a map in wild West Yorkshire winds, or explaining that originally phone boxes were supposed to be silver, and not red.It was all very gentle and amusing, if a little too gentle at times, bordering on slightly slight. I worried that it might skirt too close to making Monkman and Seagull the butt of the joke, rather than celebrating their thirst for knowledge, but to its credit, it never quite did.“It’s given me a desire to continue exploring,” said Seagull at the end, which is handy, as he has three more episodes in which to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e170672ca337d6110b79fa69473692d7cbbde819/0_92_4216_2530/master/4216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0431de7ed74fdc12dc7322b4b1b7e6ca","title":"brett kavanaugh accuser testify senate committee","story":"The supreme court nominee and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexually assaulting her, have been called to testifyDonald Trump’s supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman accusing him of sexual assault have been called to testify in an extraordinary public hearing that could determine the fate of his confirmation.Under immense pressure, Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate judiciary committee, said his panel would hold a hearing next Monday with both Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that he sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers in high school.“To provide ample transparency, we will hold a public hearing Monday to give these recent allegations a full airing,” Grassley said in a written statement, as Republican leaders attempt to prevent the accusation from sinking Kavanaugh’s nomination.Ford’s allegation, made in the Washington Post on Sunday, plunged Kavanaugh’s nomination into uncertainty, delaying a committee vote on his confirmation that had been scheduled for Thursday. But Republicans, including majority leader Mitch McConnell, remained defiant that the process would move forward.Trump said the nominee “looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation” and stands read to testify as soon as the panel calls him.Trump defended Kavanaugh earlier on Monday, calling him “one of the finest people I’ve ever known” while saying he did not have a problem with delaying the vote.“If it takes a little delay, it’ll take a little delay,” he told reporters. He added: “They’ll go through a process and hear everybody out. I think it’s important.”Asked if Kavanaugh had offered to withdraw his nomination, Trump did not answer directly, simply responding: “What a ridiculous question.”Ford, 51, is a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in northern California. Speaking to the Post, she described an incident she said happened when she and Kavanaugh were in high school in the early 1980s.She alleged that Kavanaugh and a friend – both “stumbling drunk” – corralled her into a bedroom at a party. Kavanaugh then pinned her on a bed, she said, groping her and placing his hand over her mouth. Ford said she was able to escape only when the friend jumped on top of them.In a statement released by the White House on Monday, Kavanaugh issued a fresh denial of the claims: “I have never done anything like what the accuser describes – to her or to anyone.“Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I am willing to talk to the Senate judiciary committee in any way the committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.”Ford’s lawyer, Debra Katz, told NBC’s Today Show her client was “willing to do whatever it takes to get her story forth”.Republicans hope to confirm Kavanaugh before the midterm elections in November, when their Senate majority could be at risk. But by midday a growing number of Republicans had sought to delay the vote until senators had more time to examine the claims.Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican on the committee who called for the vote to be delayed, said a public hearing was the “best route forward”.“Obviously these are serious charges, and if they’re true, I think that they’re disqualifying,” he told reporters.Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a senior judiciary committee member and strong Republican supporter of Kavanaugh, said he spoke on Monday to Kavanaugh, who said he was not present at the party where the alleged assault occurred.Hatch said: “I’ve known him for a long time, he’s always been straightforward, honest, truthful, and a very, very decent man.”Democrats have called for the FBI to handle the matter by reopening Kavanuagh’s background investigation.“Republicans and their staff cannot investigate these allegations,” Senate minority leader Charles Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. “They’ve already said they’re not true.”Republican leadership meanwhile fumed at Democrats for not previously disclosing this information, during their one-on-one meetings with Kavanaugh or during his confirmation hearing, which drew raucous protests and partisan bickering earlier this month.“Now – at the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that the nomination should be delayed,” McConnell said in remarks on the House floor.Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat, received a letter from Ford detailing the allegations in July, in which she asked for complete anonymity. In the interview with the Post, Ford said she decided to come forward publicly only after the allegations – and her identity – began to circulate.Feinstein and nine other Democrats on the committee have signed a letter demanding that the matter be turned over to the FBI investigate rather than have members’ staff make phone calls.“In view of the enormity and seriousness of these allegations, a staff-only phone call behind closed doors is unacceptable and Democratic staff will not participate,” the letter said. “This isn’t how things should be done and is in complete violation of how this committee has worked in the past.” The allegations have raised the stakes for a handful of moderate Democratic senators and two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, all of whom were already undecided on Kavanaugh’s nomination. On Monday, Collins wrote on Twitter: “Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.”The White House has sought to cast Kavanaugh as a champion for women. As the Ford allegation surfaced late last week, initially anonymously, a pro-Kavanaugh letter was published, signed by 65 women who said he had always “behaved honorably and treated women with respect”.The letter appears to have been orchestrated by confirmkavanaugh, a website funded by the Judicial Crisis Network, a group that relies upon undisclosed donations and backs conservatives for judgeships. The friend of Kavanaugh’s named in the Post report, the writer Mark Judge, said he had “no recollection” of the alleged events.In an interview with Fox \u0026amp Friends on Monday, White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway said it would be up to the Senate committee to decide if Ford speaks publicly or privately.“Let me make this very clear,” she said. “I’ve spoken to the president. I’ve spoken to Senator Graham and others.

In one, the family’s lawyers contest the “arbitrary decision” by the judges to reject witnesses, experts and documentary evidence linking the murder to a wider criminal conspiracy.Victor Fernandez, one of the lawyers representing Cáceres’ three daughters and mother, said: “We will not tolerate or stay silent about institutional abuses, no matter how routine and normalized these abuses are in the criminal justice system in Honduras, because that will guarantee impunity for the criminal structures responsible for the murder.”Cáceres, the coordinator of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh), was subjected to surveillance, harassment, false criminal charges and multiple death threats before she was killed.The eight defendants are also charged with the attempted murder of Gustavo Castro, a Mexican environmentalist who was injured in the gun attack but survived by pretending to be dead. Five were arrested in May 2016. The law requires cases to be resolved within two and a half years after detention. Failing to do so could provide grounds for appeal.“We want justice but we want a fair trial, which respects due process for us the victims and the accused,” said Bertita Zuniga Cáceres, the murdered leader’s daughter and current Copinh coordinator.In a bizarre start to proceedings, the hearing was initially delayed as the judges decided to hear a petition from an unrelated drug trafficking case. Three hours later than scheduled, the jam-packed courtroom was informed that the trial was suspended until the appeal court decides whether the judges are competent to proceed or not.

It seemed too bleak, too depressing, too fraught – get a historical detail wrong and you risked accusations of insensitivity and exploitation.Now, 170 years after a million people died and more than a million emigrated, comes Black 47, a big-screen blockbuster that uses the famine as a western-style revenge thriller. There are lots of muskets, explosions and horse chases, the lead actors are Australian, and many of the interiors were shot in Luxembourg.And the Irish love it. Cinemagoers flocked to the film’s opening weekend, making it the biggest grossing Irish film in Ireland this year with a box office of €444,000 (£395,000).Critics have lavished praise. “It’s The Outlaw Josey Wales with more rain and fewer Comanche,” said the , citing Clint Eastwood’s 1976 revisionist western. “An admirable attempt to go where no one has gone before,” said the Irish Independent’s review. “The kind of Irish film John Ford might have made if he’d been inclined to move beyond the wistful paddywhackery of The Quiet Man.”The Irish famine ran from 1845 to 1849 and killed an estimated one million people from hunger and disease. A million more emigrated.A population boom, extreme poverty and sub-ision of land into tiny plots left rural communities dependent on potatoes. When blight wiped out crops the result was disaster, especially in 1847, creating the nickname Black \u002747.Ireland was then part of the United Kingdom but the British government responded late and feebly, leaving people to eat grass while wealthy landowners in some of the most stricken areas continued exporting food.The catastrophe, which according to some measures continued until 1852, permanently transformed Ireland\u0027s demographics and socio-political structure and led to generations of emigration. Known in Ireland as the Great Hunger, it has been immortalised in poetry, ballads and plays.The $10m Irish-Luxembourgian co-production is set for a north American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this week before opening in the UK and US on 28 September.It stars James Frecheville as an Irish ranger who returns home in 1847 after fighting for the British army in Afghanistan and discovers that his mother has died of hunger, his brother has been hanged, and the rest of his family is inhabiting a wasteland of ruined crops and official callousness in Connemara on the Atlantic coast.When the ranger launches a campaign of bloody vengeance against authority, the British draft one of his former comrades, played by Hugo Weaving, to track him down.Jim Broadbent plays Lord Kilmichael, an aristocrat who exports grain despite corpses piling up in the countryside, and Stephen Rea plays a GaelicEnglish translator. Freddie Fox, Barry Keoghan, Moe Dunford, and Sarah Greene also star.“The famine is one of those essential Irish stories that we haven’t figured out a way to bring to the screen,” the director, Lance Daly, told the  on Monday. “Doing it as a revenge thriller was a really smart way to smuggle the story of the great hunger to a wide audience which might not be first in line to watch a film about famine and suffering and the truly horrid history of the time.”Daly, from Dublin, filmed the exteriors in Connemara and Wicklow and consulted historians on the details.The famine, triggered by a blight in potato crops, ravaged Ireland from 1845 to 1849, a humanitarian catastrophe that flummoxed the British government even as Quakers, Native American Choctaws, the Ottoman empire and others sent assistance.“It’s not just some story,” said Daly. “It’s a story that belongs to everyone. I felt a great responsibility to get the history right, to get the language right, and that didn’t make the British characters out to be villains and the Irish as innocent victims. The deeper you go, the more complex it gets.”Channel 4 prompted indignation in 2015 when it commissioned a television comedy series titled Hungry from Hugh Travers, a Dublin-based writer. Some 40,000 people signed a petition condemning the project.“Murder, genocide, people dying, retching with their faces green from eating weeds, their bowels hanging out of them – no passage of time will make that funny,” Tim Pat Coogan, a historian and author, said at the time. Channel 4 scrapped the series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/192c2c62f785a1ccb572176e92daa89a9269de25/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2a266ae682c078fc724e896f52beee2","title":"italy accuses austria of stoking discord in eu with passport proposal","story":"Rome cancels meeting over Vienna’s plan to offer citizenship to German speakers in South TyrolItaly’s foreign minister has cancelled a meeting with his Austrian counterpart over Vienna’s plans to grant citizenship to the German-speaking residents in the northern Italian province of South Tyrol.The proposal by Austria’s ruling conservative and far-right coalition “deteriorates the climate of mutual serenity and trust, which make up the essential foundations for the success of this type of meeting,” the office of Enzo Moavero Milanesi said on Monday.It denounced Austria’s “anachronistic desire for revenge” in light of this year’s centennial anniversary of the end of the first world war.

But a growing chorus of critics has begun to question it, drawing attention to the crimes committed in the service of Portugal’s colonial project.The current row has its origins in last year’s mayoral campaign, when Lisbon’s incumbent mayor, the socialist Fernando Medina, drew up a list of 25 tasks he hoped to accomplish if re-elected. The list included the idea of building what was initially dubbed the Museum of the Discoveries. The document provided few specifics, giving neither the location nor exact content of the future museum and saying only that the space was to cover the “most and least positive aspects” of the Age of the Discoveries and “include an area dedicated to the topic of slavery”.The proposal went largely unnoticed until April, when more than 100 Portuguese and international academics released an open letter criticising the proposed name as an “obsolete, incorrect expression, filled with wrong-headed meanings”.That letter, which appeared in the Expresso weekly, opened the floodgates for a slew of opinion pieces and TV roundtable debates, with participants coming out for and against both the proposed name and also the very principle of such a museum.“It would only reinforce Portuguese colonial ideology, which portrays that period as heroic and simply glosses over the glaring issues of slavery, mass killings and other abuses,” said Joacine Katar-Moreira, a researcher at the University Institute of Lisbon and co-author of an open letter criticising the proposal that was signed by 100 black activists. “There are already so many statues and monuments paying homage to that moment in history. We don’t need another one, which, like the others, would be an instrument for stroking national self-esteem.”Katar-Moreira and other activists would like to see funds earmarked for the museum put instead towards a monument honouring the victims of slavery.Portugal was the leading player in the Atlantic slave trade, its galleons thought to have transported nearly half of the total 12.5 million enslaved Africans. (The British were a distant second, trading 3.2 million people.) Portugal has, however, long cast itself as the “bom colonizador”, or good coloniser, citing the fact that inter-racial relationships flourished in Brazil and Cape Verde as proof that its colonial practices were somehow “softer” than those of other European powers.Historical evidence refutes such a reading – a point stressed by those who oppose the proposed museum. Other commentators have bristled at the suggestion that Portugal has anything to be ashamed of.“It’s not possible to erase history,” the columnist João André Costa wrote last month in Público newspaper. “It happened. It existed. We can’t go back in time … and we don’t have anything to beat ourselves up about, kneeling for 100 years, with downcast eyes and hearts.”Even the prime minister, António Costa, whose family has its origins in Goa, Portugal’s former colony in India, weighed into the debate. He said in a recent interview: “We mustn’t have a complex, but rather pride in being able to deal, in Portugal, with that period in history when we undoubtedly made our biggest contribution to the world.”The Lisbon authorities have maintained a low profile throughout the debate, except, according to local media reports, to float potential alternative names, said to include the Museum of the Discovery – without the plural – Museum of the Expansion and Voyage Museum. Requests for an interview with Medina went unanswered.With the fate of the museum still unclear, the argument looks likely to continue, stoking a debate many regard as long overdue.“I think it’s a useful debate but I think it needs to happen in a measured way, and not harden into the extreme positions we’ve seen on both sides,” said the director of Público, Manuel Carvalho, who in June wrote an opinion piece entitled The Heavy Burden of Being Portuguese.“I’m completely in favour of us talking about the dark side of the Age of the Discoveries, about the things that weren’t taught to us in school, where we only heard about the heroic side. But you can’t demand a society to change overnight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e46a58309ec489821a24bacce2dc42ce452f4ce/0_131_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ab99ec5e290d5774a2247f2cedeab6","title":"mexico jalisco trailer full of corpses","story":"Locals in Guadalajara complained after they noticed the trailer’s stench following wave of violence that overwhelmed morgues Mexicans have reacted with outrage after authorities in the western state of Jalisco left a trailer full of decomposing corpses on the outskirts of Mexico’s second-largest city following a wave of violence which overwhelmed local morgues.Locals in the Guadalajara suburb of Tlajomulco complained to police after they were alerted to the presence of the trailer by the stench.“This affects our kids, it smells horrible and the longer it stays it’s going to stink even worse,” Patricia Jiménez told Reuters.It soon emerged that the trailer had previously been parked by officials in the suburb of Tlaquepaque, but was moved on orders of the mayor.It has now been moved to an industrial area near the state attorney general’s office, according to news reports.On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbspThe Jalisco state attorney general’s office has not commented, but an official in the office said the trailer was properly refrigerated and never “abandoned”.The office also disputed press reports the trailer contained 157 corpses, with sources telling local media the number was closer to 100.Jalisco’s general secretary Roberto López told local media that the state’s morgue had been overwhelmed by a surge in deaths, adding that a new morgue should be finished in a month and a half. “When it is built, these bodies will be transferred,” he said.The row over the trailer – which erupted as the country celebrated its national day on Sunday – was yet another reminder of the grim toll from the country’s decade-long drug war.Mexico’s homicide rate hit a record high in 2017 with 29,168 murders registered. The country recorded 2,599 homicides in July 2018, its most murderous month since 1997, when Mexico started keeping such statistics.It was not the first time that the bloodletting has been so severe that local morgues have run out of space – similar incidents have occurred in the opium heartlands of Guerrero.But the gruesome episode in Guadalajara has underlined how violence has spread to all corners of the country. The surrounding Jalisco state has deteriorated rapidly in recent months: 15 people were injured in May when a gun battle erupted in the city centre after a brazen assassination attempt on the state’s employment secretary.In March, three film students in the Guadalajara suburb of Tonalá disappeared after unwittingly filming property associated with a drug trafficker when they were working on a college project.Much of the violence in the region is the work of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) which has disputed territories across the country – especially those controlled by the rival Sinaloa Cartel, whose former leader Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán was extradited to the United States last year.More recently, CJNG has itself splintered into rival factions. In July, US and Mexican officials announced that had raised the reward to $1.56m for information leading to the arrest of the CJNG boss Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as “El Mencho”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f396857035a9919b201560c91ff85ac2857957/0_303_4545_2727/master/4545.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77292d0ffc647eaef163710205a4c550","title":"us russia north korea sanctions violations nikki haley","story":"Nikki Haley said Russia sought to evade sanctions on North Korea and then cover it up by suppressing an official UN reportThe US has accused Russia of wholesale violations of international sanctions on North Korea, secretly transferring huge quantities of oil and other commodities to the regime’s ships at sea.In a heated session of the UN security council, the US envoy, Nikki Haley, said Moscow had systematically sought to evade sanctions on Pyongyang and then cover up its operations by suppressing an official UN report.Her Russian counterpart, Vassily Nebenzia, rejected the accusation and said his office had not tried to censor the report by a UN panel of experts, but had merely wanted Russian views to be reflected.But Haley said Washington had “evidence of consistent and wide-ranging Russian violations”.“To evade port inspections, oil tankers come together over the high seas. North Koreans use hoses to transfer refined petroleum products to their ships to bring back home. Many tankers are willing to provide oil to make a quick buck,” the US ambassador added.She said that the US tracked “at least 148” cases of oil tankers delivering petroleum products in illegal ship-to-ship transfers, but did not make clear how many of these cases involved Russian ships. Haley said that the North Korean regime had obtained between 800,000 and 2m barrels of refined petroleum in the first eight months of the year – well above the 500,000 barrels cap set by the UN.She listed other ways in which she said Russia had sought to blunt UN scrutiny and sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear weapons and missile programme.“Step by step, sanction by sanction, and time and time again, Russia is working across the board to undermine the sanctions regime,” Haley said, adding that last month’s UN panel of experts report “contained evidence of multiple Russian sanctions violations”.“We have seen and read this report,” the US envoy said. “But when the panel submitted the report to the security council last week, we noticed something deeply troubling. The evidence of Russian violations that was detailed in the earlier report was missing. It had been removed from the open section of the report.”“Apparently, Russia threatened to prevent release of the report unless its demands to hide the evidence of its violations was met. To our deep regret, the panel agreed,” Haley said.A European diplomat at the UN confirmed that a section on Russian sanction-busting had been removed from the expert panel report.“We heard they were making changes and then last week, they made a quite different report,” the diplomat said.The UK ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, said the panel’s report should be “submitted in its original form”, calling it “extensive and well-researched”.The UN did not respond to questions about the changes made by the panel of experts. In his reply to Haley, Nebenzia said that member states were entitled to communication with the experts panel to present evidence and counter-arguments. The report had not been redacted, he argued, but a particular passage on a Russian company had been removed only from the published version of the report.“The panel of experts ... has become extremely politicised for reasons beyond our control, it has been almost taken hostage by Washington, which is trying to prevent the normalization of inter-Korean relations with all its might,” Nebenzia said. “Sanctions cannot replace diplomacy,” he said.The security council row over sanctions-busting came at a time when the leaders of North and South Korea are preparing for a third summit next week in Pyongyang, in a bid to revive momentum towards defusing tensions and paving the way towards disarmament.Following his own summit with Kim Jong-un in June, Donald Trump had declared North Korea was “no longer a nuclear threat”. However, the UN under secretary-general Rosemary DiCarlo told the security council that “there continue to be signs the DPRK is maintaining and developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program”.The nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, also said last month that it had “grave concern” over the further development of Pyongyang’s weapons programme.Haley insisted however, that the Trump-Kim summit had “set us on a path toward complete denuclearization”. But she added: “But we’re not there yet. And until we get there, we must not ease the powerful worldwide sanctions that are in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9140bd5514f594a2161c24e3e5ea07284d6e0c89/0_168_5192_3115/master/5192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3760ef1aa82336a105b208bbc572d6c7","title":"russia military aircraft syria jet lost contact","story":"Defence ministry say the aircraft was carrying 14 servicemenRussia’s defence ministry said it had lost contact with an IL-20 aircraft with 14 servicemen on board near Syria’s Hmeimim airbase, Syrian state-run Ikhbariya TV reported late on Monday.The US believes the Russian jet was inadvertently shot down by Syrian government anti-aircraft artillery, a US official told Reuters.“The missiles were not fired by the US military and we have nothing further at this time,” a spokesperson for the Pentagon told the .Reports of the downed plane came after missiles were fired from the sea at several locations in the Syrian coastal city of Latakia on Monday.

There are isions between college management and academics in University College Dublin over a new private club for staff on the south Dublin campus.The construction of the University Club, which will not be open to students, was approved at the university’s governing authority board meeting last December. The development will serve as a clubhouse and restaurant for staff, alumni, and visiting guests or dignitaries.The two-storey clubhouse is expected to cost about €14 million to construct, according to sources on the board. The building is expected to be open by next April, and looks out onto the main lake on the south Dublin campus.However, there were isions over the project at the university’s governing board, according to minutes of meetings released under the Freedom of Information Act. Several academic board members and students’ union representatives objected to the project.In a rare occurrence, the board took a vote on the issue, which approved the development by 21 votes to 10.The club will offer “fine dining”, and will be a “high quality” social facility for “small- and large-scale university and corporate member events”, according to documents submitted as part of the successful planning application.Briefings from a meeting of the university finance committee last November, stated the “facility will generate revenue through a combination of membership sales, food and beverage sales, with potential for increased income from conferencing and room rental.” The briefing said income from the clubhouse is expected to pay for the cost of its construction within 22 years.In April, €480,000 had been spent on the project, according to minutes of finance committee meetings. The club will be connected to the existing O’Reilly Hall, which is used for graduation ceremonies.The project is understood to be a priority for university president Andrew Deeks. In a recent email to all staff, Prof Deeks said “most world-class universities have a venue of this nature” and the club would address a “significant gap.”Students’ union president Barry Murphy said he was “firmly against” the construction of the club. “The new building was given priority over more critically needed services and facilities for UCD students,” such as refurbishing the ageing James Joyce library, or investment in under-pressure mental health services, he said.The vast majority of students would “under no circumstances” support the private staff club, Mr Murphy said.The new club will see an existing staff common room in the university’s arts and humanities building re-purposed, which has been opposed by academics.Associate professor of musicology Wolfgang Marx, chair of the committee which runs the common room, said the lounge “has existed since 1975 and is a significant part of UCD’s heritage.”Prof Marx said the new club would be a more formal facility, “to impress political and other high-ranking guests.”In recent weeks a petition has been circulated among academics, to pledge to refuse to join the new staff club, if the common room is closed.The common room committee has also encouraged academics to raise objections to the plan to shut the existing lounge with senior university officials.UCD did not respond to requests for comment on the opposition to the University Club."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3631872.1537211071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey receives second council nomination for presidential race","story":"Clare County Council has become the second local authority to nominate Dragons’ Den star and businessman Peter Casey as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election.Kerry County Council earlier on Monday voted to nominate him, with four nominations needed for a place on the ballot paper on October 26th.

Journalist Gemma O’Doherty was proposed and seconded by Sinn Féin William Delaney was proposed by an Independent and seconded by Sinn Féin.In Kilkenny County Council, a motion to nominate Ms O’Doherty was defeated on Monday.She was proposed by Cllr Breda Gardner (Independent) and her motion was seconded by Cllr David Kennedy (Sinn Féin). Cllr Seán Tyrrell (Sinn Féin), Cllr Melissa O Neill (Ind) and Cllr Tomás Breathnach (Labour) all supported the motion. Eleven members abstained from the vote while seven members voted against the motion. Cllr Gardner told members that she believed that Ms O Doherty “deserves to be on the ballot paper”.Other councils have already nominated three candidates to stand in the election: businessmen Seán Gallagher and Gavin Duffy and Senator Joan Freeman.Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada will also be nominated following her selection at a party meeting on Sunday.This means at least four candidates will compete against the incumbent, President Michael D Higgins, who holds a commanding lead in the polls.Candidates can be nominated by 20 Oireachtas members or four county councils. There are still 19 councils who have yet to nominate anyone.Earlier artist Kevin Sharkey, who dropped out of the presidential race last night, denied his campaign was a promotional tool for his painting career.Announcing his withdrawal, Mr Sharkey called the process of trying to secure support from four county councils a “circus” and a “farce”. His statement also provided details of an exhibition showcasing his paintings entitled, The Presidential Collection 2018, as well as a music single he intends to release.“I make no apologies for being a businessman,” he told The .He said at no stage during his campaign did he “mention or even allude” to his career as an artist.Earlier this month in a presentation to Kilkenny County Council Mr Sharkey, who is black, said he has sold 10,000 paintings and if he had “red hair and freckles” he would have had a statue erected in his honour.Asked why he is withdrawing, Mr Sharkey replied the process was a “pantomime” and “a waste of time”.“It’s bad enough to waste taxpayers’ money with this nonsense, but to waste my time as well!” he said.He cited the example of some candidates who have been nominated by councils despite not making presentations to them. Mr Sharkey said the process was so flawed you might as well “rip up the Constitution”. He said the consequence is a narrow field of candidates, including three wealthy businessmen and a Senator.Mr Sharkey’s platform included a call to bring back the death penalty for attacks against elderly people in their homes. He also criticised how motorways have cut off small rural towns and suggested opening Famine villages to draw tourists.All villages should have a girl with red hair playing a harp in the corner, someone cooking cabbage or someone burying someone outside like they used to do in the old days, he said. “This is a gold nugget that we are sitting on.”He is the first potential candidate to withdraw from the race. He has asked councillors who supported him to transfer their allegiance to journalist GeMs O’Doherty who is running on an anti-corruption platform.“She is a woman of huge integrity and is currently bravely shining a light on the rampant corruption that is destroying our beautiful country and democracy. And she needs to be heard and listened to,” said Mr Sharkey.Four county councils met on Monday to decide on whether to nominate further candidates for the presidency.The majority of councillors on Louth County Council on Monday voted not to nominate someone for the election.However, given the vote was not unanimous, next Monday was earmarked for the required special meeting of the council in case any of the councillors wished to nominate someone before the deadline of September 26th.A number of councillors congratulated Mr Duffy, from Drogheda, on securing a nomination.Alan Sherry, senior executive officer with the council advised members they still had time if they wished to nominate somebody and reminded them that three clear days’ written notice was needed for the required special meeting and next Monday was suggested for it.Initially Cllr Thomas Byrne, said he wanted to nominate Mr Casey although he later withdrew that.When Cllr John McGahon proposed the motion that the council not nominate anybody, there were a number of seconders.Sinn Féin members abstained on the vote while three councillors voted against it.Most of the main Oireachtas parties have said they will support Mr Higgins’s candidacy. However, there are enough Independent TDs and Senators to nominate one other candidate if they can agree one.Councillors in Kilkenny and Westmeath are also expected to vote today on whether to nominate one of the remaining hopefuls.Mr Gallagher and Mr Duffy have asked the remaining councils to back other candidates as both have already secured nominations.Last Thursday, Dublin City Council refused to nominate any candidate. A meeting to hear from potential candidates ended in farce following a presentation by satirical candidate “Bunty Twuntingdon-McFuff” who called for, among other things, burning the dead as a source of fuel.“I’m protesting against the quality of candidate,” she said afterwards.According to a poll published in the Sunday Business Post yesterday 67 per cent of people would re-elect Mr Higgins. His closest opponents are Mr Gallagher at 15 per cent, Mr Duffy at 6 per cent and Ms Freeman at 3 per cent.Those who said they would vote for a Sinn Féin candidate amounted to 7 percent.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3632456.1537211770!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit trade checks must not be on border epp chief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tManfred Weber, leader of the European People’s Party in the European Parliament: “In the next weeks, there are tough decisions to make,” Mr Weber said ahead of his meeting with British prime minister Theresa May on Tuesday. Photograph: Sean GallupGetty ImagesAny new technical or electronic checks on trade after Brexit must be at ports and airports and not on the Border, the leader of the European People’s Party (EPP) Manfred Weber has said.Mr Weber was speaking to The  ahead of his meeting with British prime minister Theresa May on Tuesday.The EPP, which includes Fine Gael, is the largest group in the European Parliament and currently holds most of the top European jobs – including the presidency of the European Commission (Jean Claude Juncker), the presidency of the European Council (Donald Tusk) and the presidency of the European Parliament (Antonio Tajani).“In the next weeks, there are tough decisions to make,” Mr Weber said. “On a technical level, a lot of things have been agreed. Now is the time for political decisions.“Chequers was a good step, but it is not the final position,” he said. The UK government’s Chequers plan lays out its future relationship with the EU.He stressed that the approval of the European Parliament – and therefore of the EPP group that he leads – will be needed for the withdrawal treaty that EU and UK negotiators hope to agree over the coming weeks.“Without a solution to the Border there will be no support from the EPP family . . . We cannot accept a solution where we have strict border controls.”He said that there was “already sometimes checks” on agricultural goods moving from the North to Britain. Asked if those checks could be expanded, he replied, “Exactly”.Mr Weber insisted the EU must “fully respect” the decision of the UK to leave. “But it must be clear that a country leaving is losing advantages . . . For us, it must be clear – it makes a difference when someone is leaving.”He said that far from leading to the further fracturing of the EU, Brexit had instead strengthened the European Union. The “pre-condition” for this was that the 27 remaining countries were united, he said, to face the challenges from “external powers who want to see a weak Europe”.Mr Weber called for clarity in the political declaration on the future relationship that is intended to accompany the withdrawal agreement.“I hear it can be uncertain or unclear . . . I don’t like this. People must know what Brexit is,” he said.Mr Weber is seeking to be the EPP’s nominee in the “Spitzenkandidaten” process, where the major parties in the European Parliament elections put forward lead candidates to head the European Commission after next year’s European elections.As a German Christian Democrat MEP, he is in a strong position to secure the nomination, though Brussels gossip suggests that Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier could also be a contender for the commission job.He says Europe must address the questions of identity , adding: “Where is the end of the enlargement process?”For him, the line is clear: the Balkan states can eventually join, if they satisfy EU norms, but Turkey cannot. “Ninety-nine per cent of people tell me that Turkey is not Europe,” he says.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Six presidential hopefuls were present in the council chamber on Thursday, September 13th, to plead their case for a nomination for the upcoming election. A theatrical presentation from Norma Burke, also know as Bunty Twuntingdon-McFuff, led to outrage and disgust from councillors in attendance.Kilkenny County Council has voted not to nominate any candidates for the 2018 presidential election. A motion to nominate Gemma O’Doherty was defeated on Monday, 5-7, with 11 abstentions.Seán Gallagher’s name went back on the presidential ballot paper after Wexford County Council approved his nomination early on Monday afternoon.Mr Gallagher was one of two nominees, the other being Ms Freeman.Mr Gallagher secured 16 votes from Fianna Fáil and Independent councillors in the 34-person council and Ms Freeman received 10.Galway County Council has nominated Senator Joan Freeman to stand as a candidate in the presidential election.Ms Freeman was one of three candidates nominated at a special meeting of Galway County Council.Also nominated were Mr Casey and Mr Gallagher, although Mr Gallagher did not attend to make a presentation.Ms Freeman won by 12 votes to seven for Mr Casey and six for Mr Gallagher.Two nominations – that of Ms Freeman and Mr Gallagher – had been made to Galway City Council after a presentation by nine candidates to councillors last week.Mr Gallagher indicated he would be happy to withdraw as he had already secured the support of four local authorities.Seven councillors supported Ms Freeman, there was one vote against, and eight abstentions, while two councillors were absent.Former RTÉ Dragons’ Den panellist Peter Casey and journalist Gemma O’Doherty attended a special meeting of Monaghan County Council to seek support for their selection.The council decided to adjourn the proceedings to a further special meeting next Friday to decide on the question of support for potential contenders.Mr Gallagher received his third endorsement of the day in his bid to become a presidential candidate after Leitrim county councillors backed him on Monday.Fianna Fáil councillor Mary Bohan told colleagues that Mr Gallagher had been “shafted” by RTÉ in the last presidential election and deserved a second chance.Seven presidential hopefuls were due to make contributions to a special session of Mayo County Council but only one turned up, Sarah Louise Mulligan.All the other scheduled speakers sent their apologies stating that they could not attend due to similar meetings elsewhere.Strongly backed by Fianna Fáil members, Mr Gallagher was nominated to contest the presidency on a 12-10 vote.Mr Gallagher secured 10 of the 16 votes available.

Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPAAnother false dawn? Or are prospects for a Brexit backstop deal as promising as some in London suggest? Can this week’s Salzburg summit really see a breakthrough?News reports have been hinting at a new flexibility on the part of EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to give Theresa May a break, a new willingness, supposedly, to embrace British proposals on how to deal with the problem of maintaining a frictionless border on the island of Ireland.But there’s a strong element of “pot-half-full-or-half-empty”, wishful thinking emanating from London, and a glossing over of the essential principle of the EU position – still firmly maintained by Barnier – that Northern Ireland will have to be treated separately from the rest of the UK. That it is a case apart.That is what the UK has been resisting strenuously because of the implication, as the DUP sees it, of a “border” on the Irish Sea. The UK alternative is for the whole of the UK to maintain sufficient regulatory alignment with the EU to make separate treatment for Northern Ireland unnecessary.The problem is that such a solution would entail serious “cherry picking” of EU single market rules, a prospect adamantly opposed by the EU 27. Except, they say, in respect of the “small” territory of Northern Ireland in the interest of safeguarding the peace process.Barnier has for weeks been trying to “de-dramatise” the commission’s proposals to make its solution palatable and politically unthreatening to unionists by making it clear that the EU has no ambitions to change the constitutional position of the North.He gave a lengthy explanation of his views on September 3rd at the Commons Brexit committee.“We are ready to simplify these checks, to have them carried out at a number of different places and have checks, thanks to technical means, which could take different forms,” he told MPs.Controls on the flow of goods or animals and animal products, don’t have to imply a political border, or be on a border, he said. They already exist on the Irish Sea for agricultural products.And regulatory controls to ensure goods going into Northern Ireland comply with single market rules might happen at ports, on ships, or even at the factories where the goods are produced.The commission has even embraced a willingness to look at British proposals, suggested last summer and known as “MaxFac”, or “maximum facilitation” as part of the solution – trusted trader schemes, technological monitoring of goods movements, and special arrangements for small, border businesses.“We need to see how and when and where these controls would take place,” Barnier told the Commons. “They could be dispersed. They could take place in different places, on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland, they could be done using technological means, they could be dispersed, as I said, or simplified in technological terms.“Just to make that absolutely clear, we are not talking about a border. We are talking about controls. Some of these controls are already carried out in Northern Ireland on products coming from Great Britain. For example, plant-health checks, veterinary checks, animal checks.”Among the reassurances apparently given to London, the Financial Times claims, is that they could all be handled by UK customs officials without requiring EU officials in tow.Although the commission negotiating taskforce – and indeed the Irish, most vociferously – had previously insisted that the MaxFac measures would not be adequate to guarantee the integrity of the single market and police a UK-EU border regime, it appears that there is a willingness in Brussels to consider them as part of a Northern Ireland backstop solution.The commission, in effect, is turning the tables on the UK, calling its bluff: “You like MaxFac? Fair enough. Now let’s try it out on our backstop . . . these are your proposals and they certainly minimise any requirement for a hard border. Which is what you say you want.”But, critically, the commission remains adamant that its willingness to bend or circumvent single market rules can only apply to Northern Ireland. London still has to bite that bullet and shows no inclination to do so, and certainly not ahead of Thursday’s Salzburg summit. Irish officials, moreover, remain confident that the meeting will see, if anything, a reinforcing of the strong political support by the 26 for Ireland’s position.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Image: Screengrab from  videoA disagreement between Chinese tourists and a hostel in Stockholm over check-in time has turned into a diplomatic spat between China and Sweden, with Beijing criticising Sweden for violating the human rights of Chinese citizens.China has demanded an apology from Sweden over three Chinese tourists who Beijing says were “brutally abused” by Swedish police on September 2nd. The Zengs, a family of three – a son and his two parents – had arrived at a hostel in Stockholm around midnight, hours before their booking. They were allowed to wait in the lobby until the staff ordered them to leave and police forcibly ejected them.Video footage shows police carrying the group outside, while the son yells in English: “This is killing. This is killing.” Another clip shows the three lying on the ground crying loudly while the mother wails in Chinese: “Save me.”The Chinese embassy in Sweden said on Saturday that China’s ministry of foreign affairs and the embassy had “made solemn representations” to the Swedish government “stressing that what the police had done severely endangered the life and violated the basic human rights of the Chinese citizens”.The incident comes as ties between China and Sweden have come under pressure. The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who Beijing considers a violent separatist, visited Sweden last week, and China continues to hold Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen and book publisher, in custody.News of the altercation has attracted widespread attention in China where the search term “Chinese tourists mistreated by Swedish police” has received more than 130 million views and 85,000 posts on the microblog Weibo. Discussion of the incident has turned into a debate about the behaviour of Chinese tourists at home and abroad.“This is shameful. The image of China has been disgraced in the hands of these people,” one Weibo user wrote. “The Dalai Lama visits Sweden and the foreign ministry uses this incident as a pretext to make a fuss. That’s more embarrassing than the performance of this family,” another wrote.“These people feel the world should move around them, if not, then they lie down on ground and scream for help,” one commenter wrote in an essay posted on WeChat.Mr Zeng told the Global Times he had asked the hostel to let his parents, who are elderly with health problems, stay until their room was available. The staff refused and called police to remove them.“I broke down and lost my mind,” Mr Zeng said. “I was not able to think whether it is was appropriate or not. I just wanted to denounce the police and seek help from pedestrians.”Swedish prosecutor Mats Ericsson told the Swedish newspaper, Aftonbladet, that no preliminary investigation had been initiated because “we made the assessment that no crime on the part of the police had been committed”.A manager at the hostel told the newspaper the family had arrived the day before their booking and refused to leave. The hostel said staff called police sometime after midnight, when the tourists began to make verbal threats.“We only know that we have done everything we could do for this guest, but at the same time we can not accept that our staff are exposed to threats and that other guests will suffer from a threatening situation,” the hostel manager said, according to Aftonbladet. – "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

This is a pity because if we ever needed a laugh, it’s now.”He went\u0026nbspon to warn that a generation of comic writers could be lost as the focus changes towards immediate high ratings – something that has been achieved by the BBC’s latest drama, Bodyguard. “Controllers find it easier to say no\u0026nbspto comedy because it’s risky, and yes\u0026nbspto another procedural drama,” he said.TV preview: The 18 shows to look out for before the end of 2018Emma Stone \u0026amp Jonah Hill star as two people in a three-day drug trial which promises no complications or side-effects whatsoever… Things do not go as planned.

It doesn’t make sense. Why is laughter considered so much cheaper than tears?”Plowman also relayed how dramas are much easier to sell to foreign markets, unlike comedies.

June 22, 2017It\u0027s strange to think, but Kendrick Lamar hasn\u0027t actually appeared at Glastonbury Festival before. This year he topped the Coachella bill and also appeared as a headliner at Reading \u0026amp Leeds, so he\u0027s no stranger to festivals. Glastonbury seems as though it\u0027d be a great fit for the hip hop star, but perhaps he\u0027ll be too busy working on a follow-up to 2017\u0027s acclaimed album,\u0026nbspDAMN.\u0026nbspThe Australian pop star recently said she would love to get a headline slot, after she was forced to pull out in 2005 to undergo treatment for breast cancer.\u0026nbspI think I would have been the first solo female to headline in however many years it was, so I was really proud of that at the time, she told the\u0026nbspPress Association.\u0026nbspObviously it didn\u0027t happen. So yes, it would be amazing and very emotional to be standing there and doing what I didn\u0027t get to do all those years ago, for sure.Michael Eavis has been after Fleetwood Mac for years, but said in 2016 that unfortunately he just couldn\u0027t afford what its members were asking for.\u0026nbspAdele did it for less, Rolling Stones did it for a reasonable rate, he said. We can\u0027t afford to spend £4-5m on people to play. Mick Fleetwood said he would do it himself, but come on. I\u0027d like the rest of the band and they all want to be paid a lot of money.Emily Eavis says one Glastonbury 2019 headliner is already bookedMick Fleetwood talks Lindsey Buckingham ahead of Fleetwood Mac tourA brief history of Fleetwood Mac\u0027s ever-changing lineupHe then suggested in 2017 that Stevie Nicks as a solo performance would be a good alternative: Maybe I could get her on her own.However, things may be looking up – despite the band\u0027s split from Lindsey Buckingham – Fleetwood Mac recently announced tour dates for 2019. Mick Fleetwood also teased an appearance last year, suggesting: One day we\u0027ll just get on a plane and come over and do it.The pop megastar\u0027s\u0026nbspReputation\u0026nbspworld tour runs until the end of 2018 with a closing date at the Tokyo Dome in Japan, but there\u0027s\u0026nbspscope for it to continue beyond that if Swift decides to return to Europe next summer.Her close friend and fellow pop star Ed Sheeran, who headlined last year,\u0026nbspsuggested she may not be keen on a Glastonbury slot because she doesn\u0027t like festivals. However, given the success of her headline appearance at the BBC\u0027s Biggest Weekend festival in Swansea – dubbed the Glastonbury replacement for 2018 – perhaps she\u0027ll reconsider. There\u0027s no doubt whatsoever that she\u0027d put on an amazing pop spectacle – earlier this year\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspgave her opening\u0026nbspReputation\u0026nbspshow in Manchester five stars out of five and called it the biggest event on the 2018 pop calendar.\u0026nbspOne person who might convince Swift to appear at Glastonbury is another rumoured performer: Sir Paul McCartney. The Beatles legend recently revealed that one of the songs on his new album\u0026nbspEgypt Station\u0026nbspwas inspired by Swift and her positive anti-bullying messages to fans.\u0026nbspI was actually thinking about Taylor Swift and her relationship to her young fans and how it\u0027s sort of a sisterly thing, he told the BBC of his song Who Cares. I was imagining talking to one of these young fans and saying: \u0027Have you ever been bullied? Did you get bullied?\u0027Then I say: \u0027Who cares about the idiots? Who cares about all this? Who cares about you? Well... I do.Paul McCartney reveals advice he\u0027d give himself after Beatles splitPaul McCartney: What makes the most successful pop star keep writing?Asked by Jo Whiley about the potential of Macca getting his own headline set, he said: Oh we always want him – he\u0027s top of our list. We\u0027ll have to see. He last headlined in 2004, and with his 17th\u0026nbspsolo album\u0026nbspEgypt Station\u0026nbspnow released and topping the charts in the US, a Worthy Farm visit doesn\u0027t sound completely beyond the realms of possibility.\u0026nbspIt wouldn\u0027t really be Glastonbury without another Oasis reunion rumour flaring\u0026nbspup, as unlikely as it still appears to be. However, with both the Gallagher brothers releasing solo albums this year, perhaps the festival will find space for both of them. Although it\u0027s probably safer to keep them on separate stages.\u0026nbspThe grime king released his debut album Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer\u0026nbspin 2017, receiving critical acclaim, an appearance on the Mercury Prize shortlist, and earlier this year a mindblowing performance at the Brit awards. As one of the hardest-working people in the music industry, no one could say he doesn\u0027t deserve a spot on the Pyramid Stage.\u0026nbspIt was Stormzy himself who sparked the rumours of his potential Glastonbury headline slot, after he shared a cryptic Instagram story which showed a quote by Noel Gallagher on previous Glasto headliner Jay Z: No, I\u0027m not havin\u0027 hip hop and Glastonbury. F***in\u0027 no chance.The comment is a slight mis-quote from the former Oasis star who was asked how he felt about Jay Z\u0027s watershed moment at the festival\u0026nbspin 2008.Sweden holds world\u0027s first major \u0027women only\u0027 music festival Stormzy has launched a Cambridge scholarship for black studentsStormzy announces #Merky Books imprint with Penguin Random HouseIf it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it, Noel said. If you start to break it then people aren\u0027t going to go. I\u0027m sorry, but Jay Z? no chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curveball in on a Sunday night you go \u0027Kylie Minogue?\u0027 I don\u0027t know about it. But I\u0027m not having hip hop at Glastonbury. It\u0027s wrong.Festival organiser Emily Eavis contradicted Noel earlier this year, explaining that genre was irrelevant when it comes to booking a good act.It\u0027s about who is going to produce the most exciting show and is making the best music, she said. We always encounter debate, which is great, that\u0027s what it\u0027s all about. Most music fans are open minded and many discover new music by coming to festivals and getting blown away by some amazing artists that they\u0027ve never seen before.Enter your email addressFill out

Sketch.Toddlers exposed to bacteria-killing products more susceptible to obesity\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspgut organisms altered,\u0026nbspstudy suggestsClick to followThe IndependentPopular home disinfectants are being linked with childhood obesityHousehold disinfectants may be making children overweight, scientists findEveryday disinfectants and surface cleaners could be making children overweight by altering the bacteria in their guts, a new study suggests.Babies exposed to household disinfectants have a higher body mass index (BMI) at the age of three, while excess weight is less common in toddlers from homes that clean with eco-friendly products, researchers have found.Although the scientists warned that no causal link had been proven, they said the results suggested gut microorganisms were “the culprit” in the link between disinfectant use and children becoming overweight.The Canadian experts took samples from 757 infants for their study, during which they followed participants as they grew from the womb,\u0026nbspinto childhood and adolescence.Babies from homes where antimicrobial disinfectants were used at least once a week were twice as likely to have higher levels of a bacteria linked with obesity when they were three or four months old than those whose families did not frequently use disinfectants, the study found.When the children with higher levels of the bacteria\u0026nbspLachnospiraceae were three years old, their BMI was higher than that of their peers, according to the report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.Higher levels of Lachnospiraceae are linked with higher body fat and insulin resistance, although it is normal to find them in the gut, said Anita Kozyrskyj, senior author of the study.The human gut hosts tens of trillions of microorganisms, including an estimated 1,000 species of bacteria.The researchers did not find any links between\u0026nbspobesity and\u0026nbspthe use of washing detergents that did not contain bacteria-killing ingredients such as bleach and hydrogen peroxide.Ms Kozyrskyj, a paediatrics professor at the University of Alberta, said the results suggested that gut microbiota – groups of microorganisms – were the culprit in the association between disinfectant use and becoming overweight.Past research has drawn a connection between gut microbiota composition and weight in adulthood.Piglets born indoors and raised in conditions where disinfectant aerosols are frequently used have perturbed gut microbial balances compared with those not reared under such conditions, the scientists noted.They said babies living in households that used eco-friendly cleaners had different microbiota and were less likely to be overweight as toddlers.“The eco-friendly product-using mothers may be more healthy,” the professor said, adding that the mother’s overall healthier lifestyle and eating habits may benefit both the gut bacteria and their children’s weight.It is possible that some disinfectant products contained\u0026nbsptriclosan, which is no longer used in UK cleaning productsMs Kozyrskyj said she could not recommend buying eco-friendly products as a direct result of the study, since a causal link had not been confirmed, but she said the findings had opened her mind to using green products such as homemade vinegar cleaners in her own home.Sally Bloomfield, honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said more questions needed answers before conclusions could be drawn.“This study must be regarded as only a preliminary indication that disinfectant use might be a contributory factor to reducing gut microbe ersity, alongside factors such as c-section birth, overuse of antibiotics etc, she said.A major flaw is the non-homogenous nature of the products in each category.\u0026nbspIn some cases, the commercial products were categorised into disinfectants or detergents\u0026nbspwithout detailed knowledge of ingredients.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

It still leaves a whole host of questions, since it did not explain the threat in any detail at all, but appeared to rule out the more extravagant and extraterrestrial theories.AURA has been cooperating with an on-going law enforcement investigation of criminal activity that occurred at Sacramento Peak, it said, in reference to the hill where part of the observatory is located. During this time, we became concerned that a suspect in the investigation potentially posed a threat to the safety of local staff and residents. For this reason, AURA temporarily vacated the facility and ceased science activities at this location.It said that the unexplained threat was enough to force it to evacuate staff, because they couldn\u0027t be protected otherwise.The decision to vacate was based on the logistical challenges associated with protecting personnel at such a remote location, and the need for expeditious response to the potential threat, it continued.\u0026nbspAURA determined that moving the small number of on-site staff and residents off the mountain was the most prudent and effective action to ensure their safety.Astronomers at the facility will now be able to go back to their work, and people kicked out of their homes during the shutdown will be allowed to return. But there will continue to be substantial amounts of security as that return happens, it said.Given the significant amount of publicity the temporary closure has generated, and the consequent expectation of an unusual number of visitors to the site, we are temporarily engaging a security service while the facility returns to a normal working environment.And it also made clear that it was aware the silence and mystery around events had helped add to that speculation. But it said that it had no other choice.We recognise that the lack of communications while the facility was vacated was concerning and frustrating for some. However, our desire to provide additional information had to be balanced against the risk that, if spread at the time, the news would alert the suspect and impede the law enforcement investigation. That was a risk we could not take.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/17/16/toy-nursery-rhyme.jpg","title":"nursery rhyme late night mystery loudspeaker ipswich alarm spiders","story":"Created with Sketch.Unnerving tune woke up residents in Ipswich by\u0026nbspplaying over and over againClick to followThe Independent‘It’s raining, it’s pouring, the old man is snoring, he bumped his head and went to bed, and couldn’t get up in the morning’A sinister recording of a children’s nursery rhyme being played repetitively late at night tormented a woman\u0026nbspfor over a year before investigators solved the mystery.Alice Randle was one of several residents who heard the creepy rendition of “It’s raining, it’s pouring”\u0026nbspcoming from somewhere outside their homes on the outskirts of Ipswich.Sometimes the tune played just once at 2am or 4am, but other times it repeated over and over again for hours.The rhyme, which relates the story of an old man who bumped his head and couldn’t wake up, left Ms Randle frightened and questioning whether she was imagining things.“It’s sung by what sounds like a very young child,” she told The Independent. “It’s very haunting, people have said it’s like something out of Freddie Krueger.”Rare jumping spider discovered in UK for first time everParents to receive advice on teaching nursery rhymes and alphabetIona Opie: Scholar of ‘The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes’ Ms Randle, who has two children,\u0026nbspfirst heard the nursery rhyme in September last year and initially tried to ignore it before finally calling Ipswich Borough Council in desperation two months ago.\u0026nbsp“The last couple of months I’ve been quite committed to finding out what it was,” she said. “I’ve been out with a friend of mine, we went on a mission, calling local businesses.”\u0026nbspThe council’s rapid response team drove out to the scene several times in an attempt to track down the noise only for it to fall silent before they got there.They finally tracked it down when Ms Randle called in after being woken up by the same recording at 11.15pm on 10 September.“It was only in the last couple of weeks that it started to play over and over again,” said Ms Randle. “I told them they would definitely hear it if they came this time.”The team arrived at her home in\u0026nbspBramford Road 15 minutes later.“We did hear the nursery rhyme playing and it sounded very eerie at that time of night,” a spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the council said.The\u0026nbspchild’s voice was being played through a loudspeaker on\u0026nbspa warehouse\u0026nbspa few hundred yards away on the Farthing Road industrial estate.“We don’t know at this stage why it is playing – it might be simply an alarm that is being triggered – but we will be visiting the operators to find out more,” the spokesperson added.“We appreciate that people living nearby would find it quite spooky.”Ms Randle said the owners of the site had told her that the nursery rhyme was being triggered by spiders.“When they examined the motion sensors there were\u0026nbspspiders and webs across it, so that’s how they know,” she added.A\u0026nbspspokesperson\u0026nbspfor the site\u0026nbsptold the\u0026nbspIpswich Star\u0026nbspnewspaper:\u0026nbsp“The sound is only supposed to act as a deterrent for opportunistic thieves that come onto our property, and it is designed only to be heard by people on our private land.“We are now aware of the problem – the motion sensors were being triggered by spiders crawling across the lenses of our cameras and it looks like we’ve had it turned up too loudly.“We’ve spoken to the resident who brought it to our attention and adjusted it so this should not happen again.”“It’s a massive relief and I’m looking forward to getting some actual sleep from now on,”\u0026nbspMs Randle said. “The last week has been lovely.”UK news in picturesIt\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

(Kabul, March 22, 2015)The number of Afghans in a food “crisis” was abnormally high, the\u0026nbspFamine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a US-funded\u0026nbspmonitoring service, said in a report on 31 August.“Crisis” is step three on a five step scale, where four is “emergency” and five is “catastrophe” and possible famine.Emergency outcomes are expected to emerge in Badghis and Faryab provinces in January, FEWS NET said.“Normally, during this time period, food security outcomes begin to seasonally improve in much of the country, but due to drought and severe reduction in wheat production, reduced labour opportunities\u0026nbspand continued conflict, more households face crisis outcomes than normal,” said the network.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’.

While LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in the country enjoy equal rights in some areas, including military service, housing and age of sexual consent, they are banned from giving blood or adopting as a couple.The socially-conservative country has few LGBT-friendly politicians and the Orthodox Church enjoys widespread influence.But in July, LGBT+ couples won a rare victory after Romania’s constitutional court ruled that residency rights must be given to the same-sex spouses of European Union citizens.Several LGBT+ campaign groups lobbied the constitutional court before its latest verdict on the gay marriage vote, with Amnesty International warning the change “could result in making it impossible to protect same-sex unions in the future”.Barbora Černušáková, Amnesty International’s researcher on Romania, said it would be a “backward step”.The definition of ‘family’ put forward by the supporters of this referendum is frankly inaccurate it only captures a very limited fraction of what family means to people in 2018Arpi Avetisyan, ILGA Europe\u0027s litigation officer, added: “Romania has a responsibility to protect all its citizens – straight and LGBTI.The definition of ‘family’ put forward by the supporters of this referendum is frankly inaccurate it only captures a very limited fraction of what family means to people in 2018.And it is also very out-of-step with reality and with the ersity of families being recognised by international human rights bodies and European courts.Supporters of a constitutional amendment have claimed it would protect Romania’s “traditional family”.The debate mirrors efforts by conservative groups in Russia, backed by President Vladimir Putin, to limit LGBT+ rights under so-called gay propaganda rules agreed in 2013.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg","title":"putin erdogan syria idlib sochi russia turkey talks","story":"Created with Sketch.Gathering is second in 10 days for the Turkish and Russian leadersClick to followThe IndependentBattle for Syria\u0027s last major rebel bastion on hold as Putin and Erdogan meet to discuss next movesThe leaders of Turkey and Russia are meeting in Sochi on Monday for hastily arranged talks\u0026nbspover the fate of Syria’s last major rebel stronghold.For now the impending\u0026nbspoffensive on Idlib province, touted for weeks by Damascus and its Russian and Iranian backers, appears to be on hold as a result of Turkish diplomatic agitation and military manoeuvres.Turkey is struggling to prevent an onslaught by pro-Damascus forces on the rebel-held Idlib province, but its moves may have also escalated the potential dangers of the conflict.“We will continue our efforts with Iran and with Russia,” Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a press conference in Islamabad late last week. “We will continue our efforts on international platforms as well.”In recent days, Turkey has begun fortifying positions in Idlib ahead of the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive. Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles. The military positions were set up in cooperation with Russia and Iran as mechanisms worked out during a series of talks that began in the Kazakh capital of Astana to monitor local truce deals.Fears for 3m people in rebel-held Idlib ahead of regime offensiveA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the oppositionA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition“These 12 observation points were equipped with limited military equipment and their main role was to monitor the agreement done in Astana,” said Nawar Oliver, a Syria specialist at the Omran Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in Istanbul. “At the moment when the regime started to mobilise its forces around Idlib, Turkey started to send reinforcements to some of these points.”Syrian forces aided by Russian air power could easily overrun the outposts. But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1018522_1.jpg","title":"brexit latest news britain european union withdrawal agreement irish border","story":"Senior Government officials and diplomats in Brussels, the UK, and other European Union capitals have said the deal will be presented at a yet-to-be arranged summit in the Belgian capital before Christmas.According to respected political website Politico differences still remain between the two sides, particularly on how to solve the Irish border issue, but the diplomats claimed that if a deal is clinched, it will be quickly approved by EU27 leaders.It would be seen as a pivotal moment for under-fire Prime Minister Theresa May, with the step up in momentum helping her force the deal through Parliament before opponents can challenge it in any great detail.Britain and the EU are now working closely to get the deal over the line, intent on avoiding any issues that critics could potentially pick apart and delay the process further.

He would then begin drafting the text.The Northern Ireland border issue remains a potential stumbling block, so EU officials said reaching a resolution on the withdrawal agreement will require reassuring language to ensure Dublin feels its interests are protected.But one EU diplomat told Politico this would need a rare concession from Mrs May, who has so far rejected the EU\u0026rsquos backstop plan aimed at avoiding the need for a hard border.Brexit: Theresa May would still need to get the agreed deal passed through Parliament  (Image: PA)The diplomat said: \u0026ldquoThey want to deal with this as part of the future relationship, but you can\u0026rsquot be sure that the future relationship stuff will work out. For us, it\u0026rsquos a matter of trust.Once the final withdrawal details are agreed, Mrs May would then have to get it through Parliament, but Brussels fears failure to do so could trigger complete chaos, such as a general election or a second Brexit vote.Politico said it approached 14 diplomats close to Brexit negotiations and not one said they believed the UK is serious about exiting the bloc without a deal.One said: \u0026ldquoThe Brits will keep on publishing material on it, no doubt, but it\u0026rsquos really difficult to believe in it.

French MP slams EU handling of Europe migration crisis\u0026ldquoIt was they didn\u0026rsquot want a situation where they could see people coming from the European Union having those automatic rights in terms of coming here to the United Kingdom, and a set of rules for people outside the European Union.What we will be doing is putting forward a set of rules for people from the European Union and people from outside the European Union.Mrs May\u0027s remarks could mean that when Britain leaves the bloc, European migrants could be subject to non-EU citizen restrictions, including visa applications.Caps could also be put in place on the number of skilled and unskilled workers entering the UK from the EU.It is likely the PM will unveil the new immigration plans during her Tory conference speech  (Image: Getty)However, Whitehall sources have predicted a tense showdown over migration due to concerns over the scheme from colleagues including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark.Mr Hammond was reported to want to promote a scheme which would not cut EU migration, so that the economy would continue to benefit from a constant supply of labour.Nevertheless, Brexiteers are likely to welcome tougher rules on EU migration and will reject any plans that promote freedom of movement.Passionate Brexiteer MP Liam Fox recently suggested the UK could use the end of freedom of movement in the aftermath of Brexit as a tool to lure international partners into investing more in the UK.                The DIRTIER the Brexit the more damage to BritainPhillip Hammond reportedly wants a scheme which would  not curb EU migration (Image: Getty)Speaking to Sophie Ridge on Sky News, the Tory Brexiteer said: It\u0027s about not having a system that\u0027s skewed towards EU citizens.We need to see that that free movement is brought to an end.From the points I have been making, it\u0026rsquos very clear that it has its advantages, not just in terms of stopping public services being used by those who haven\u0026rsquot contributed, but it can be an extra tool in the box when it comes to future trade negotiations with other countries.Net migration fell below 250,000 for the first time in three tears earlier this year - but it remains over the promised 100,000 target first set by David Cameron in 2010.Mrs May has previously hinted she will battle to get the level of immigration below 100,000 by 2022 - the end of the next five-year Parliament despite pressure from her own Cabinet to ditch the controversial target.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a dead has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.The former Foreign Secretary claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of hard - Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.     A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004332280201-e1536969175592.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"josie russell is a walking testament to the power of human spirit her mum would be very proud","story":"In 1996, when she was just nine years old, she survived a hammer attack that killed her mum Lin and little sister Megan.The three of them were walking down a quiet country lane near the Kent village of Chillenden when they were tied up, blindfolded and ­repeatedly beaten.Josie’s mum and sister were found dead at the scene. The ­family’s beloved pet dog was also killed by deranged Michael Stone.Josie herself was left with such severe head injuries that medics at she scene thought she was dead before finding a faint pulse.This little girl was a fighter.It must have been horrendous for both of them.Josie couldn’t speak for a year after the attack, had to have an operation to put a titanium plate in her head and her recovery was slow. It was all about small ­victories, and it was down to the tenacity of a little girl who just wanted to live a normal le.Now she is flourishing.Josie has become a successful artist, is engaged to her soul mate Iwan Jones and recently bought the family home in Wales where she spent her early childhood before they all moved to Kent where the attack happened.The house is full of happy memories and Josie dwells on events like her mum bringing home Rosie the pony when she was just five years old and teaching her to ride.Rosie is now a grand old lady of 27 and one of the most ­important things in Josie’s le.The feisty little pony is a link to her mum and little sister and played a massive part in her recovery. Learning how to ride again gave her confidence and a sense of freedom.Josie graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2009 and built up her own art business, first by selling handmade cards at fairs and now producing beautul ­textile landscapes.I’ve met Josie several times over the years, most memorably shortly after the accident when she was still coming to terms with the double tragedy of the death of both her mum and sister.She was shy and wary but gradually I gained her confidence and we spent a lovely afternoon together with her dad Shaun and Rosie the pony.I caught up with her again this week, and I’m always struck by her positivity and her refusal to be thought of as a victim.She very much lives in the moment and always tries to seize the day and be positive.Josie is a walking testament to the power of the human spirit and her mum would be very proud of her beautul, talented, happy daughter.LOTS of speculation already over who will be heading Down Under for I’m A Celebrity in November.Names being bandied around include EastEnder Danny Dyer, Corrie’s Michael Le Vell and former Strictly pro Brendan Cole.GMB’s Kate Garraway is keeping mum about rumours but she would be a hoot, although the person I’d really like to see there is my pal and TV colleague Dr Hilary Jones, who we’ve mocked up in the jungle, pictured.A team player and an action man, he also has a filthy sense of humour, doesn’t suffer fools gladly and would dispense medicine and advice when the insects start to bite and tummies get upset after being fed a diet of ostrich bum.And at the risk of objectying the good doctor, I would pay good money to see him in his skimpies having a shower at the famous waterfall.The ambitious project was first discussed in 2004, when I was rector of Dundee University. It’s wonderful to see it spring to le.Inevitably, costs spiralled. But hopefully the increase in tourism, business and the jobs created will more than offset the £80million price tag.As a proud adopted Dundonian, I want the V\u0026ampA to be a museum for everyone. I hope schoolchildren will enjoy the exhibits, friends will meet there for coffee and everyone in Dundee will think of it as their own.It’s here and I can’t wait to celebrate.IT’S a bit icky – and frankly unbelievable – that Corrie has Jim McDonald pretending his current girlfriend is his dead daughter in order to wreak revenge on his clan.More Game Of Thrones than a game of dominoes down the Rovers... and I can’t take it seriously., so I am. I’ve missed him bellowing “ELIZABETH!” and talking about being in the big house, so I have.I just wish they hadn’t oversensationalised his  because the character is big enough not to need such an OTT comeback.It did get me thinking as to who else I would like to see back in Soapland.And one fab character sprang to mind. I’m sure you recall Emmerdale’s Paul Lambert, who made a huge impact during his five years in the Dales.Paul was played by the ridiculously handsome Mathew Bose, who must have a painting in the attic because he hasn’t aged a day since leaving school.Surely his  is long overdue. His family are still in Emmerdale, including dad Rodney Blackstock, auntie Diane Sugden and his half-sisters. There are lots of layers to Paul, too.His alter-ego is drag queen Thelma Louise, while he and his boyfriend Jonny were the first characters in a primetime drama to have a civil partnership, back in 2008.Surely such an interesting character should be welcomed back to Emmerdale with open arms.We will know more tomorrow night, but I’m spending far more time than is good for me speculating about how it’s all going to be resolved.IT’S been a long time since I considered Jacob Rees-Mogg an amusing anachronism, a bit like a pocket watch.Behind this softly spoken throwback to the Victorian age is a flinty hard-liner who would deny a raped woman the right to an abortion.He’s hell-bent on a rock-hard Brexit, and he doth protest too much about not wanting to be Prime Minister for it to ring true. So it’s fair to say I’m not a fan.But I was appalled by the rude, ignorant mob of “class warriors” who heckled his kids and their elderly nanny outside the family home this week.It was cruel, savage and out of order. Rees-Mogg has chosen to be a politician and is used to being barracked.His children, however, are NOT public figures. They are little kids, who looked scared by the thuggish behaviour of the idiots, who did their cause no good at all.They were there to protest about the minimum wage, and one of them shouted at the children that their nanny, Veronica Crook, wasn’t paid very much to “wipe their bottoms”.Veronica, who has been with the family for half a century, was not best pleased by this, and in a brisk, no-nonsense way defended her boss and ushered her charges indoors. You got the feeling she would dearly have loved to give the protesters a very hard stare and sit them on the naughty step.Politicians from all sides expressed their disgust but those responsible don’t think they have done anything wrong.The minimum wage is well worth fighting for, but not like this.The demonstrators managed to humanise Rees-Mogg, and gained him bucketloads of sympathy.

May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs.

The Cowgirl Cafe - made headlines with a photo of Jesus face miraculously appearing in a pancake in 2014.Christ has also been spotted in bird poo, an MRI of a mans heart, and several frying pans.Not to mention the countless times hes appeared in toast.Miraculous icons bearing the faces of Jesus or the Virgin Mary are known as acheiropoieta, meaning icons made without hands.These are images which are approved of by Christians as authentically showing the holy figures.Famous examples of such icons include the Image of Edessa and the Veil of Veronica.But as well as those with the seal of Christian approval, there are plenty of less well-attested examples of Jesus face appearing in odd objects including buildings, rocks, and food.The scientic explanation for many of the sightings people claim to have had of Jesus is due to a phenomenon called pareidolia.Pareidolia describes the brains over-sensitivity to finding patterns in completely random information, such that faces can sometimes be seen on inanimate objects."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434623003.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lib dems brexit referendum","story":"The party voted to adopt a new policy which would see the Government tell the EU we no longer want to leave in March next year.The controversial plan emerged as anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller told Lib Dem activists that quitting the EU is like WW2.The party’s longstanding policy is to fight for a second referendum on Brexit which could overturn the result of the 2016 vote.But at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, party members voted to adopt a more radical policy which might see Brexit reversed on the say-so of Parliament - without the public getting a say.The new policy, backed by leader Vince Cable, calls for the Government to extend the Article 50 process - the formal mechanism of quitting the EU - to give time for a new referendum.But it adds that  Brussels refuses to accept an extension, the UK should unilaterally revoke it anyway - keeping Britain in the EU indefinitely.Today Ms Miller gave a speech at the Lib Dem conference pushing for a re-run of the 2016 referendum.She said that leaving the EU without a trade deal would be like jumping off a clf and harked back to WW2 as she laid into senior Brexit-backing politicians.The businesswoman said: “Too many of today’s politicians presume they know better than that great, idealistic generation -

neighbours retreated upstairs, overcome by the smoke.“We were fast asleep and my phone rang – I’m so lucky it wasn’t on silent.”“I put on my dressing gown, grabbed my little ones and ran out into the

whole building is on fire, your friends and neighbours are burning down, you have nothing to think about, your mind, your brain, everything goes blank.”It would not have been easy, getting her father Ahmed Abdel-Rasoul, then aged 87, and their two children Mohammed, six, and 20-month-old Zahra Rasoul to the bottom of the tower.The Duchess of Sussex has been helping with a new book produced by cooks from the Hubb Community Kitchen, an initiative based near the site of the Grenfell tower in London.The new book, Together: Our Community Cookbook, a collection of 50 recipes from the erse users of the communal kitchen at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, will be used to allow the project to expand and open for up to seven days a week.She first visited the kitchen in January and has made a number other private trips to the centre to meet volunteers and learn more about their work.Some of the recipes are family favourites and all have been created by the cooks who support not only residents affected by the Grenfell fire but others in the community.Meghan helped put the group in touch with a publisher and her Royal Foundation provided assistance with legal and administrative issues.All proceeds will go back to the Hubb and the book will be available in stores this week.I immediately felt connected to this community kitchen it is a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together, Meghan, who first visited the kitchen in January and has made other private visits since, wrote in a foreword.Melding cultural identities under a shared roof, it creates a space to feel a sense of normalcy in its simplest form, the universal need to connect, nurture, and commune through food, through crisis or joy something we can all relate to.Mahmud said she and her friends had approached Al-Manaar to ask  they could use the kitchen there and the Hubb project - hubb means love in Arabic - arose out of it.Last summer, we were placed in a hotel and I had no kitchen to cook for my family, Mahmud wrote.It was very emotional for me to get in the kitchen. The moment I started cooking I was in tears. I didnt know why though. I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.Word started to spread the mums from my sons school came along and they told their friends, too. Soon there were women from dferent cultures all cooking, swapping recipes, talking and laughing together.The duchess is photographed on the front of the of the book helping out and Mahmud said the royal had been happy to join in.She wore an apron, she wrote.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After 10,000 signatures, petitions get a response from the Government and after 100,000 they are considered for a Commons debate.Following Sky News successfully lobbying for TV debates in the 2010 election campaign, three head-to-head clashes between Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg were held.But since then broadcasters and politicians have failed to agree on terms and there were no head-to-head debates between the leaders of the main parties in the 2015 or 2017 general election campaigns.     The first party leader to back the Sky News campaign was the Lib Dems\u0027 Sir Vince Cable, who praised the 2010 TV election debates and said: \"They energised the whole election campaign.\"It\u0027s surely right that the ground rules should be decided in a non-political independent environment of the kind you suggest.\"We should now be putting this structure in place so there\u0027s no argy-bargy in the few weeks before the next general election.\"For the Tories, former Downing Street director of communications Katie Perrior said Theresa May had been wrong to refuse to take part in TV debates in last year\u0027s general election campaign.\"Having called the election, to then refuse to debate against her political opponents was a mistake,\" she said of her former boss on TalkRADIO. Signicantly, the current director of communications at 10 Downing Street, former TV executive Robbie Gibb, was editor of the BBC\u0027s election debate during last year\u0027s election campaign and a big supporter of such debates in his former role.But Mr Corbyn\u0027s unequivocal backing for the Sky News campaign will increase the pressure on the prime minister to drop her opposition to debating with the Labour leader in a future general election campaign.From the Conservative back benches, leading Eurosceptic MP Peter Bone said the Sky News proposal was closely aligned to one he has already tabled in a private member\u0027s Bill which is due to have its second reading in the Commons next March.When he first tabled his Bill, its sponsors included the former TV presenter Esther McVey, now in the cabinet as work and pensions secretary, and another veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP, Sir Christopher Chope.     He now hopes to attract more sponsors.\"These debates should not be left to the political parties,\" he said.\"They should be decided by an independent commission and we need to get this sorted out, not in the frenzy of a general election but before.\"The one dissenting voice amid a chorus of support came from the Tory deputy chairman, James Cleverly, who tweeted: \"I\u0027m not a fan of leaders debates.

Fortunately for new husband James Coad, 30, it wasn’t a case of lost delivery drivers, but all part of his cunning plan. The secretive spouse organised the giant Subway sarnie to be delivered in the middle of his wedding speech, as a special reminder of his very first date with his new we, Lucinda, 26. James, of Hemel Hempstead, said: “Lucinda and I have been together for five years now.  We met at work, as you do, but we didn’t really hit it off at first – in fact she thought I was a bit of an idiot. “I fancied her a little bit, and one night in 2013 we all went on a typical work night out to welcome some new faces in the office. “Lucinda and I hit it off with a bit of flirting, then we went to our local nightclub, Veeda, and shared a passionate kiss in the R’n’B room. “Later in the night I took her to Subway and thought I’d be romantic by offering her an Italian 6-inch BMT. “But when I handed it to her – she dropped the whole lot on the floor. I didn’t offer her mine though, that went home with me. “We always have a laugh about Subway now, and when we walk past we joke about the way we first met.”  However, it wasn’t until wedding planning was well underway that James had the bright idea to involve the sandwich chain in his big day, making sure nobody else knew about it – not even his best man. He said: “I was writing my speech and thinking of the first time we met, and was stumped because ours wasn’t love at first sight, she didn’t really like me that much. “The Subway story came to mind straight away. I ordered three sandwiches, an Italian BMT, Ranch Chicken and Veggie Delight. But it’s the BMT that links back to that special night in 2013.” "},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

Dividing the opposition – as the SDP did in the 80s when they cemented Maggie Thatcher in No10 – would be a fresh gt to the Tories. Listen for two minutes to the Labour kamikazes hell-bent on destroying their left-wing leader. It becomes clear some so-called moderates would prefer the Tories to Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister. In Brighton this week, Vince Cable’s shop-soiled Liberal Democrats seem so contaminated by the disastrous ConDem coalition they have nothing to lose from starting again. But let nobody be under any illusion – the governing party would immediately benefit from what would be billed as a realignment of politics. Conservatives understand that they rule by sticking together. A party that last split in 1846 over the Corn Laws is the most likely to survive Brexit basically intact.  Labour malcontents such as Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna – who are part of a dozen-strong group toying with following Thatcher-admiring maverick Frank Field out of the party – are mistaken  they think the grass is greener on the yellow side. Cable enjoyed more parties than Katie Price before settling on the Lib Dems. Behind his lugubrious air of a funeral director officiating at his own burial he is trying to recruit a Labour terracotta army to guard his tomb. I fail to see how a new Liberal-SDP Alliance could deliver what evaded the originals in the 80s. Then the Gang of Four, who led almost 30 defectors from Labour, were substantial politicians. No disrespect intended to Umunna or Leslie, but they are not a Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen. Bill Rodgers perhaps – the one everybody forgets.

Glee Club is the party\u0027s truly bizarre annual singalong. Every year on the last night of party conference, literally hundreds of activists gather to sing bawdy, often quite mean-spirited songs about politics. And they frequently take aim at the leading lights of their own party. For example, one notorious song, included in this year\u0027s songbook for the third year running, mocks late-Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy over the alcoholism that led to his early death. And this year, former leader Farron\u0027s problem with gay sex is the target of their satire. Farron was blasted in the run-up to the last election, when he admitted his Christian faith led him to believe gay sex was a sin. Of course, once it was out there, it became more or less the only question he was asked for the remainder of the campaign. So, obviously, Glee Club will tonight have the option to sing It\u0027s A Sin, to the tune of the Lowe \u0026amp Tennant\u0027s 1987 hit of the same name. Here\u0027s some highlights from the lyrics   A Christian can\u0027t become PM,   Except for, you know, all of them,   Please feel sorry for poor Tim.

He ruled out a  to politics as a British Emmanuel Macron, despite a loud roar of support for the suggestion from party faithful. And he took an enthusiastic swipe at deputy leader Jo Swinson, widely expected to be the party\u0027s next leader, for criticising the Lib Dems role in the coalition government. Swinson told Lib Dem conference in Brighton yesterday that it was time for the party to own the failures of the coalition. But Clegg hit back, telling a packed event on the fringe of the party\u0027s conference in Brighton today: We entered into government eight, almost nine years ago. And there\u0027s something quite Lib Dem about still going on about things you did that made you feel uncomfortable so long ago.  He added: The narrative is that \u0027you went into government, you sold your soul, basically just merrily went along with a savage, ideological, uncompromising approach to austerity which deliberately penalised the poor and rewarded the rich. It is not true. Arguing the Lib Dems had been blamed for everything from bad weather to traffic jams, Sir Nick went on to attack Labour, accusing them of hypocrisy for attacking the coalition, then failing to block Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan. He said: It’s quite extraordinary that a party that sanctimoniously lambasted us for half a decade because of our sincere attempts to try and basically clear up a lot of the problems which they presided over in the first place, that they are the footsoldiers of a Tory, regressive Brexit. It just beggars belief that these people dare call themselves progressive.   He said because Jeremy Corbyn is “a very old fashioned, 1970s Euro socialist who regards the European Union as a club for big business, he’s been going along and providing support to Theresa May.  “The extraordinary thing is, this government is so rubbish, a half decent opposition party not only would be 20% ahead, I reckon a half decent opposition party could destroy this government in a week.”  He asked the hall how it was possible that “the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn can be as pants as they are? Why are they so bad at their job?”  "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa must plan b brexit","story":"NewsTheresa May must have a Plan B for Brexit  her Chequers deal is rejected, say criticsThe Prime Minister continues to insist the UK will crash out of the EU with no trade agreement  the Chequers deal is rejectedShare\u0026nbspByAndrew GregoryPolitical Editor00:00, 18 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/politics/video/theresa-believes-well-good-deal-13261529,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May must come up with a fallback Brexit deal, her critics will demand today.

Glamour girl Taylor Rose, 26, has taken to Twitter to tout her old breast implants after inflating her latest pair to a whopping 30H.

When Rebecca Barrett was 33 weeks pregnant she had an emergency ceasarian after it emerged her boys had contracted acute twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This happens when there is an uneven blood flow from the placenta to both babies. One of the boys, Alfie, was starved of oxygen for 24 hours and as a result he has spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and is profoundly deaf.  Rebecca, 23, from Walkergate in Newcastle, told ChronicleLive : “Rory was the donor twin. Alfie got less then 1% of blood.   “We were out of the risk zone for twin-to-twin transfusion, as the risk zone ends at 24 weeks. “After that it’s very unusual and extremely rare. “It’s even more rare for both of them to survive. “We didn’t know whether either of them would. It was awful.” After spending time at Sunderland\u0027s neonatal intensive care unit, the family was allowed home - but Alfie was kept on oxygen for another eight months. At just three months old, doctors realised Alfie was deaf and he was then diagnosed with cerebral palsy at nine months old.  Both conditions happened as a result of the oxygen deprivation he suffered before being born. Now aged 23 months, Alfie has recently had cochlear implants fitted and the family is learning sign language so they can communicate. But mum Rebecca says Alfie struggles to play with his older brother. “He absolutely loves being able to hear and because of the cerebral palsy he still can’t talk. “Rory is walking and talking, he’s just a delightful little boy.  “Alfie can only roll, he can’t sit and definitely can’t stand. “Rory is getting very independent but Alfie is dependent on us for absolutely everything.” To help the brothers play together, Rebecca and Zak, 25, are fundraising for specialist equipment which would transform Alfie’s le.  The family are hoping to raise \u0026pound10,000 which would pay for an adaptable Squiggle chair and for a lt to be fitted at the boys’ nursery in Heaton.  Rebecca said: “We would like to have a proper seat for him. A Squiggle chair can be adapted to floor level or table level and it fully meets his needs.

While it has yet to be tested on humans, the results in trials on rabbits suggest it has the potential to save lives. “We think this is going to be a very good vaccine, and could induce immunity after a single dose,” says the study’s lead investigator, Professor Matthew Waldor, from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Hard Medical School.

Rats and mice have to eat 60 per cent of their body weight to die from the poison. Obviously because there’s loads they just aren’t dying, and we all know how fast they breed! Council fill the holes with expanding foam and then they just chew back through it. All night we were up with chewing noises and came out onto the landing and they’re chewing through the ceiling! The council workers have said themselves they don’t see this ending. Pest control have just been into the attic and there’s not even any insulation in there.

But not as slowly as the three days he spent trapped on the floor because no carer was allowed to lt him. Arthur, 84, is housebound, wheelchair-bound and alone – and completely reliant on care visits four times a day, which have drained his le savings. That’s the proceeds of the sale of his modest \u0026pound90,000, two-bed house, plus what he managed to save throughout his working le on the railways – and which he had hoped to leave to his two children, but which will soon be gone. In , his care is private, but council-contracted, which, at best, provides al basics and, at worst, has been shockingly neglectful and, arguably, inhumane.  In the past, bedtime visits have been missed and Arthur, who cannot use his legs and is slowly losing all use of his hands because of a stroke, was left in his wheelchair all night. Once, he spent three days on the floor after a fall, because his carers were not qualied, equipped or permitted by red tape to pick him up – and his case was not deemed a priority by the cash-strapped 999 service. “I felt completely helpless, and embarrassed,” he says. “My carers gave me a blanket, pillow, food and drink, and helped me with a urine bottle. They were placed in a very dficult situation, to be honest, they didn’t have the training or the equipment.” He explains: “Care’s on a ration, but it’s bankrupting me. I worked for 45 years, night shts, early shts, I never took a sick day. I bought my own home, I had some savings. But it’s going. “I have rips in my sweatshirt,” he adds, showing me the holes. “But I have to think twice before I buy a new one.” Arthur has about \u0026pound20,000 left. As he now falls below the Government’s controversially designated \u0026pound23,000 saving pot “floor”, he is receiving some contribution to his care. His sheltered flat is subsidised, too, although he still pays rent and bills. It is only when his savings hit \u0026pound14,000 – not much to show for a letime – that his local council will be prepared to completely fund his care. This though, will rob Arthur of what he clings to – choice. It could mean a move to a cheaper care home, even outside his local area, which horries the independent-minded man.  And then, on top of these worries, there’s the excruciating loneliness. With his children living abroad, and we deceased, visitors are few and Arthur’s carers don’t hang around to chat. “It feels like I am just existing,” he says, softly. “In solitary confinement.” Arthur – not his real name – has asked us not to identy him because he feels so vulnerable. He has invited me to spend the day with him because he knows, tragically, he could be any one of tens of thousands of pensioners today suffering from the social-care crisis. Arthur moved to this accommodation more than 10 years ago when his home could not be adapted for his disability. Although there are carers on site, he is only permitted to pull his red chord for emergency “toileting”. “When I first came, there were about 10 in-house care workers, now it’s three – and only one at night,” he explains. “We used to have coffee mornings, bingo, a hair salon – that’s all stopped. There are no activities now.” Instead, Arthur’s weekly highlight is to pay \u0026pound12 for the “ring-and-ride” to take him to a supermarket – the only one in town which will provide help.  I arrive at 7.15am for the carers’ morning visit to get Arthur out of bed, washed, dressed and fed. Today he gets a shower, but that’s just twice a week. Time drags until a half-hour visit at lunchtime, then teatime and, finally, bedtime. The two carers are polite but purely al. There’s no chit chat – I hear them refer to Arthur as “he”. “You put his deodorant on,” says one. “Have you done his hair?” To which Arthur pipes: “Yes, she’s done it.” Carers, under extreme pressure for often poor pay, don’t last long. Arthur explains: “I’ve had a stranger come to wake me up before. Some have set timers on their phones. “I would like them to be better trained, more understanding of my condition. When they move me, they accidentally hurt me. I understand they do what they can, but it’s the basics.” "},{"url":null,"title":"katie hopkins end inevitable just","story":"NewsopinionKatie Hopkins\u0027 end was inevitable - she was just a story, not a journalistShe paid the price in the end, says Fleet Street FoxShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist14:40, 17 SEP 2018Updated00:30, 18 SEP 2018Newsopinion\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI have long felt sorry for Katie Hopkins. She is a woman not only out of her depth, has not only floundered for more than a decade, but has no idea where she\u0027s gone wrong. It\u0027s hard to see her without thinking of a fly batting itself against a window until it expires, able to see the fresh air but unable to find it. If she reads this - which she might, because she defines herself only by what others think of her - she\u0027ll assume I\u0027m a Left-wing liberal about to rail against her Right-wing freedom of speech. No, Katie. Someone who knows more than you is going to explain how the hatred has suffocated you. We both have epilepsy - mine very mild, hers very severe. The condition strikes in her sleep, led to her being expelled from Sandhurst, to break vertebrae and frequently dislocate her shoulders. She recently had brain surgery that ended the seizures but left her with a hole in her skull and needing to re-learn how to climb stairs. She blames the medication she has needed since young for the fact her oldest daughter is autistic and her youngest was born with a deformed hip that required many surgeries to correct. Those would be enough disability for most people to deal with. But Katie has an extra one - a mistaken belief that she\u0027s a journalist.  Let\u0027s not be precious about the Street of Shame. It is a trade, not a profession, and the only qualication necessary is a level of enthusiasm bordering on mental illness. But somewhere along the line most journalists get training. They get it from a practical degree, a vocational course, or at worst from paying attention to people who\u0027re doing it already. Katie became a journalist because first she became a media star, and she managed THAT with what she called being outspoken and everyone else called being a right cow. On The Apprentice in 2006 she hogged the camera by making amusingly-nasty remarks about maternity leave, fat people, and fellow contestants. She resigned at the end of the penultimate show citing childcare concerns, which others mocked because she had known what she was getting into. But it\u0027s perhaps worth noting both that her concerns were for two disabled daughters, and also that she was mocked mainly because she\u0027d been so happy to mock others.  Katie sold her story for six-figure sums, had celebrity spats, and was pictured in flagrante in a field with someone else\u0027s husband. She got a regular column in her local paper the Exeter Express \u0026amp Echo , but it ended after an online poll found 84% of the readers wanted her fired. It was a hint she did not take. She was invited onto TV as a guarantee of ratings. Three years ago Buzzfeed reported a former staffer at This Morning said she was always willing to cause controversy from the word go. Such programmes involve a chat with a producer in advance, and Katie would immediately come up with a firm line on something, and then wheeled on-air to spout it with little thought from either her or producers about where it would end. So in 2013 when she told Philip and Holly she wouldn\u0027t let her children play with someone called Tyler or Chardonnay or named after geography, it was pointed out one of her children was called India and the clip went viral.  Katie learned to make money by being rude and unapologetic, and the media learned to shore up their audience figures with a wingnut. Inevitably, she was offered a national newspaper column, a place in the Big Brother house, and more opprobrium as the hate multiplied. In 2015 she used her column to denounce migrants as cockroaches, and it quietly disappeared before she popped up at another website which racked up \u0026pound150,000 damages plus costs for her groundless claim that a pair of Muslim brothers banned from travelling to Disneyland were linked to al Qaeda. She met holocaust deniers, tweeted about being with crew of a Save the Children ship she didn\u0027t board, and had repeated applications to join UKIP rejected. She made a habit out of getting it wrong. She moved on to LBC, left after calling for a final solution to Islamic terror, was questioned but not charged over alleged hate crimes, and more recently staged a picture with children at a school without their parents\u0027 or teachers\u0027 permission, a gross breach of journalistic ethics. She has her own website and, one hopes, has invested in some defamation legal insurance. Now she\u0027s been sued over a defamatory tweet, lost her home, and had to enter an agreement with her creditors. All of it is due to the simple fact that she attempted to be a journalist without any of the necessary skills.  If Katie had experience of working in the media before she became its favourite monster, she\u0027d have known that what you don\u0027t say is just as important as what you do. By all means say you\u0027re snobby about the name Charmaine, but it might be an idea to know Shakespeare was happy to use it for one of his characters. If you make a habit of racking up legal bills for your employer, be careful with what you publish on social media. If you are caught lying, stop doing it. Steer clear of people with swastikas in their Twitter handles and  you don\u0027t know what defamation is, look it up. But more than anything else the lesson that Katie needed to learn was this: that becoming a hate figure is a viable but short media career. She chose a path that was an ever-decreasing spiral of bile, and it was only ever going to lead her into peril. I\u0027m not sure she knows how she got there. She started out as entertainment, and ended up with the twin Pyrrhic victories of being praised by Donald Trump and winning an IPSO ruling against the Daily Mirror about the fact she was not detained for taking ketamine in South Africa, but for spreading racial hatred. Now she\u0027s broke and the only people still paying attention are creditors and knicker-snfing Nazis.  Katie was not a journalist but a controversialist - built and brought down by her ignorance of how journalism works. Her name is flung at others who make a much better fist of it, along with accusations they all want to be like her. Nothing could be further from the truth - journalists, above all things, want to be right. Katie was just a story, and it\u0027s a sad indictment of the media that it relied for attention on a sick woman spouting proto-fascist lies. But the principal blame is on Katie herself. She had enough clues, from as early as her first interview after leaving The Apprentice when Nick Hewer said her new brand had made you famous, but it\u0027s made you loathed. And where\u0027s it going to take you now? She never seems to have asked where it would lead. Even with training, she would never have made much of a journo. She has a thick skin and bloody-mindedness, but seems to lack empathy, accuracy, self-doubt or persuasiveness. She is a curiosity, but doesn\u0027t have any. The first rule of journalism is \u0027never become the story\u0027. Not just because it\u0027s professionally embarrassing, but because all copy finishes the same way - with the word \u0027ends\u0027. * Fleet Street Fox\u0027s new book, A Bluffer\u0027s Guide To Journalism, is published in March.

Gerry McCann, 50, accepted the interview to tackle the taboo surrounding men with mental health issues. The eminent cardiologist has said that he will discuss his torment in honest, personal and sometimes painful terms for the Radio 4 show. The programme is set to feature Pearl, by Simon Armitage, a modern translation of a medieval poem about a father\u0027s grief after losing his daughter. Gerry said: As a family we\u0027d worked with Simon Armitage before, and know what a sensitive, thoughtful writer he is.  When I read the Pearl poem, I could see echoes in it with Madeleine\u0027s situation and our loss. I decided it was a good opportunity to say something about the special bond between fathers and daughters, thinking that speaking openly might help other men in similar positions. It feels like the right time. Simon Armitage said: Pearl is one of the most moving poems in the language, written by a man grieving over the loss of his young daughter. While translating it into modern English I kept thinking of the McCann family and their daughter Madeleine.  I\u0027d written a poem for the family to mark the one thousandth day of her disappearance, spending some time with Kate and talking to her about le without Madeleine and the campaign to find her. He added: Gerry\u0027s voice hasn\u0027t been heard as much, and after reading the poem he agreed to give an extended interview, to tell his side of the story in terms of how men deal with loss and grief in a world where they\u0027re usually expected to stay strong and silent.  The couple promised never to stop looking for their little girl, who would now be 15, after her sudden disappearance sparked a worldwide search in 2007. Kate and Gerry had ed to their apartment in Algarve\u0027s Praia da Luz after having dinner in a nearby restaurant when they found her bed empty. Their twins, Sean and Amelie, who were toddlers at the time, remained in their cots. Her whereabouts still remains a mystery despite a \u0026pound12million police investigation.

The Duchess of Sussex made several secret visits to the area before her wedding to Prince Harry, and met a group of women who came together to cook for friends, family and neighbours whose lives had been torn apart by the disaster. When she discovered they could only offer the Hubb Community Kitchen service two days a week because of funding, she suggested they released a cookbook to raise extra cash. Now the idea has become a reality, and Meghan has today released details of the book - Together: Our Community Cookbook - including a three minute video of her cooking in the kitchen with the women. She says: Together is a cookbook, but it\u0027s also the story of a west London community who gathered together in a kitchen and discovered the healing power of sharing food.  In January 2018, as I was settling into my new home in London, I met a group of women whose lives had been affected by the Grenfell fire. They had decided to get together to cook fresh food for their families and their neighbours. And so, for two days every week, these women were able to cook and share their delicious recipes together.  I\u0027m proud to be supporting this cookbook Together. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. The book, which is supported by The Royal Foundation and published by Penguin Random House companies,showcases over 50 recipes from women whose community was affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. In the book\u0027s foreword she writes: I immediately felt connected to this community kitchen it is a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together. Melding cultural identities under a shared roof, it creates a space to feel a sense of normalcy – in its simplest form, the universal need to connect, nurture, and commune through food, through crisis or joy – something we can all relate to…  Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive. The duchess went to meet those affected at least twice at the beginning of the year, including a trip to the Al Manaar community mosque, which lies in the shadow of the charred shell of Grenfell Tower. She was without Prince Harry but was accompanied by a royal protection officer and one of the prince’s aides. The visits were compared to many made by her late mother-in-law Princess Diana, who often carried out charity work in secret. Speaking at the time, a leading Grenfell community member said: Meghan\u0027s visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts. A royal source added: Ms Markle has regularly been making private visits to organisations as she gets to know the charity sector.

Sophie Hinchclfe , known as Mrs Hinch , has become an online sensation after filming herself cleaning her immaculate Essex home, which she shares with husband Jamie and pet pooch Henry.  Her spotless kitchen and lounge have become the envy of many and her amusing commentary as she cleans is now inspiring others to don their rubber gloves and whack out their feather dusters. People are so in awe of her vivacious personality and catchphrases - including \u0027All the best\u0027 - she has won a legion of fans. With 468,000 follower and counting, they call themselves Hinch Army.   Sophie even appeared on This Morning today, alongside presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, sparking even more of a cleaning frenzy.  The 28-year-old, who got married last month, admits she cleans for at least 30 minutes a day. Her pride and joy is her shiny, streak-free kitchen sink. She stores a lot of her products in a wardrobe in her garage which she calls her \u0027Narnia\u0027. And she swears by certain items which she buys from shops such as Wilko, B\u0026ampM and Poundstretcher. Some of these stores have now even dedicated shelf space with the sign \u0027Hinch Army\u0027 for shoppers, The hairdresser has also given all her favourite cleaning items unusual nicknames.  The one item fans will be most familiar with is \u0027Minkeh\u0027 which has become like gold dust and is sold out everywhere, thanks to Sophie. She uses Minkeh , Dave , Buddy , Pinkeh  and Vera . Her other top products are Flash with Febreze Bathroom Spray, CIF Stainless Steel Spray, Toilet Duck 4in1 Liquid Cleaner in the scent Fresh Pine, 1001 Carpet Spray and Zoflora. Most of the products cost \u0026pound1 but because of Sophie\u0027s recommendations, many are selling out, or going on sale online at massively inflated prices due to the high demand.  Sophie created her profile @MrsHinchHome_X_ in March.  However, it has only been since July that the number of followers has sky rocketed since she started sharing her cleaning routines.  It just spiralled and I couldn\u0027t be more grateful, she said. It started off as around 200 or 500 [followers] a month and now it\u0027s as many as 35,000 a day. It\u0027s in the last four to six weeks that it has gone viral. I\u0027ve got followers from Ireland, the US and Australia and they are all amazing. Sophie also admits cleaning has helped her cope with her anxiety. I\u0027m a worrier, she added. For me, to keep my mind off of what was worrying me would be to clean and organise something and love the end result.  It took my mind off worrying. It helps me control my panic attacks too. Since I\u0027ve started the account others have messaged me saying I\u0027ve changed their lives and helped them with their mental health which to me is simply amazing. I get thousands of messages each day like this. Here are a selection of tips from her ever-growing Instagram page. 1. What to do with plugs Pour some soda crystals down each plug then use white vinegar spray then use neat disinfectant  while boiling the kettle. Wash it all away with boiling water. 2.How to get sinks sparkling Use disinfectant spray, add a little bit of water, then wipe down excess before using stainless steel cleaner  before using a cloth to finish it off.  3.Removing food mess from wooden floors Spray degreaser over the affected area and use an electric toothbrush to remove it before using a cloth. 4.Keeping your hob stain free Use a cloth and cleaning paste, such as The Pink Stuff. After a few minutes rinse with another wet cloth and repeat.  5.Cleaning your washing machine Slide out the drawer and use a bathroom spray, before spraying limescale remover into the gap where the drawer was. Pull back the rim and use bathroom spray before wiping down and using an electric toothbrush to remove any dirt. 6.Making sure mirrors are streak free Use white vinegar spray, and use a fluffy microfibre cloth to wipe until all smears are gone. 7.Getting rid of mattress stains Sprinkle bicarb on the affected area and rub in with latex gloves. Then you can vacuum it off after an hour.

This was to be spent on drugs - and Lorna\u0027s innate generosity and kindness meant that she spent a lot of her inheritance on other struggling addicts.  She once was flush with cash and was spending almost \u0026pound18,000 a month on drugs or \u0026pound600 a day. Lorna now had the inheritance and started to spend. She said: When I got the money I was living locally, staying round friends and everything. My mates are all addicts so there was no way that I was going to leave them without. If I could have balanced it a bit more I would have done something with it. I am glad the money went to the area. The dollar has got invested. I don\u0027t mean any disrespect to my family. I lost a lot of weight and had a nervous breakdown. The heroin stopped me eating. It\u0027s very painful when you put weight back on your body and then you lose it. When you have a nervous breakdown it is very painful to your body. Lorna said she then attempted to rent a home in Cambridge but even with a small fortune in the bank she said no-one would let a property to her.  She said: I am an addict myself and I was dossing around dferent places. I tried to get a place but they weren\u0027t having none of it. That\u0027s what I don\u0027t understand. I had local connections and I was trying to rent a place. I had money to buy. I would have got a boat. Somebody must have been using my ID, plus the fact that I am adopted which doesn\u0027t help. Lorna spent most of her inheritance on feeding her habit and giving money away to addicts. She has little to show for it now and lives a hand-to-mouth existence. And in a heartbreaking moment, Lorna admitted her regret in not giving more of the money to her daughters and how she longs to see them again. The day before she spoke to Cambridgeshire Live she thought her daughter had driven past the spot in Mill Road where Lorna can be found on most days. She said: I guess I bought a few little bits and pieces - some jewellery. I bought both my girls some school kits. I love my girls. I have heard that they are doing really well. I hope so. I haven\u0027t seen them. I don\u0027t know  that was my daughter that I waved to the other day. I am not sure where they are. I would just like to see that they are safe. Sasha will be coming up to her mid-twenties and Faith eight years behind. They are both firing on all cylinders. They have all their pistons.  Lorna spoke of her le on the street and the camaraderie she felt with other rough sleepers. And she told of how many of her pals had been lost to drugs and violence. She said: It\u0027s not too bad on the street. We have a good crew around and we all look out for each other. Everyone has their own situation but no one will let anyone down. We\u0027ve all got each others backs here. We\u0027ve just lost some friends recently, but there\u0027s no way anyone is going to go unnoticed. No chance. That\u0027s not happening. Lorna also knew Peter Anderson, also known as Blue, who died from multiple stab wounds after being attacked on Stourbridge Common on July 25. Two London men have been charged with murder. Lorna said Blue was a gentle man and was shocked when she learned he had died. She added: I knew Blue. It is surreal to me like it hasn\u0027t happened. It\u0027s just surreal. I don\u0027t get it. And she spoke of the trouble in Mill Road and how traders wanted to clean up the area. She said: I score here but I\u0027ve not noticed much trouble. It\u0027s probably other people getting involved and other people coming down here  the truth be known. I know people locally and there are things that they go through. But I think it\u0027s other people getting involved. Asked  she would have done things dferently, she said: I had wanted to bless my children. I wanted something for them. Lorna has been through the courts over the years. In March 2012 armed police were called in after Lorna was seen carrying a kne by an ambulance crew. She was jailed for eight months after Cambridge Crown Court heard she had armed herself for protection before a confrontation with another woman.

The Met Office has issued a \u0027yellow\u0027 warning for road, rail, air and ferry delays and power cuts as winds of up to 60mph batter parts of the UK. Millions of people across Southwest England, South Wales and Central and Northern Central England are set to be affected. The warning starts at 9pm on Monday night with the disruption set to last until Tuesday at 6pm. A Met Office spokesman said: Although now expected to bring less strong winds, the remnants of Storm Helene will move northeastwards across Wales and England during Monday night and Tuesday. A spell of strong winds is expected, initially mainly in the far southwest of England and across west and south Wales. The strongest winds then transferring across the Midlands and parts of northern England during Tuesday morning and into the afternoon. Winds are likely to gust 40-50 mph quite widely across the warning area whilst some coasts and hills of southwest England and Wales could have gusts of 55-60 mph.    The Met Office has warned to expect...  Some damage to trees is possible, for example large branches or trees falling in a few places. Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely Some short term loss of power and other services is possible  However, forecasters expect temperatures to remain high - with a sultry 24C in some areas. Warm and humid air from the continent, combined with a tropical flow from the remnants of Helene, should lt temperatures between 21 to 24C in southern regions, but into the mid to high teens across the north.  Tuesday should start dry and sunny for England and Wales, according to forecast models. However, it will become overcast with moderate to heavy rain for south-west England, Wales, Ireland, north-west England and Scotland with fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds through the afternoon and evening. Gusts could reach 60mph in isolated spots. Heaviest rain looks likely to be across western parts, with the southeast perhaps staying dry and very warm.

Kate Parry dropped five dress sizes and lost six stone over the past five years.  And she has gone from having no interest in exercising, to becoming a fitness fanatic keen on helping others achieve their goals.  The 25-year-old used to eat Chinese takeaway for lunch four or five times a week and at her heaviest, weighed 18 stone. She blamed her huge weight gain on a combination of laziness, poor diet and long nights on the computer playing The Sims and talking to friends on MSN.  Speaking to Hull Live , she said: My school was close to a Chinese take away, so we would go there most days for lunch which wasn’t ideal.   At first I wasn’t bothered about my weight but all my friends at school had boyfriends and I never had one, no boys were ever interested in me. Going out with her friends became uncomfortable as Kate started comparing herself to others, and leaving school only made her more conscious of her weight. Being called fat and made things worse and Kate’s self-confidence plummeted. Something had to give and she eventually mustered the motivation to go to the gym and joined Xercise4Less. Honestly, I think it was me who motivated myself, I had it in my head that I wanted to lose weight and feel good about myself and once you see results from all the hard work it makes you even more motivated to achieve more, said Miss Parry. Using a personal trainer for six months was a huge help as Kate learned about the benefits of weight training to achieve her goals. Now, she trains four to five times a week depending on her schedule.  Kate’s diet needed to change along with her exercise habits, and she ditched the Chinese food and late-night chocolate for more substantial foods. Now I usually eat porridge for breakfast, tuna, rice and vegetables for lunch and then dinner usually consists of Quorn with potatoes and vegetables. said Miss Parry. Discipline with her diet and training regime is key for Kate, but she is adamant that numbers on the scale are not important. I don’t weigh myself anymore, I don’t believe that the number on the scale represents anything at all, said Miss Parry. It’s just a number and in the past I’ve got to a point where I became obsessed with weighing myself and it made me unhappy. I go by how I feel and how my clothes fit but last time I got weighed I was around 12 stone.

The huge soft drink company is closely watching the fast-growing marijuana drinks market for a possible entry that would expand the world’s largest soft drink maker’s ambitions further away from sugary sodas. Coca-Cola announced its interest in a statement on Monday, responding to a report from BNN Bloomberg that said it was in talks with Canada’s Aurora Cannabis Inc to develop drinks infused with cannabidiol , the non-psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. Coke would join a rush by major alcohol makers and a cigarette company to test the cannabis market and find partners ahead of the October 17 launch of legal recreational marijuana in Canada.  Coke and Aurora, in separate statements, each said they were interested in cannabidiol-infused beverages but would not comment on any specics or talks. Aurora’s stock soared 17 percent, while Coke’s edged up slightly. The CBD drinks would likely aim to ease inflammation, pain and cramping, the BNN report said. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog called the news “an exciting potential development” as it would take Coke into another fast-growing healthier segment following last month’s 5.1 billion deal for Costa Coffee and expand cannabis-infused drinks in the area of al wellness products. The CBD products likely would be dferent from those produced by alcohol makers, which would likely give drinkers a buzz from tetrahydrocannabinol , the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.  Beer makers Constellation Brands, Molson Coors and Heineken are all playing in the market for cannabis products. For example, Heineken’s craft beer Lagunitas recently launched Hi-Fi Hops, a beer-flavored sparkling water with THC and CBD. “The THC beverages probably sit better with the beer makers, and maybe CBD fits better with Coke, in terms of playing off the health trend,” said Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg. Canada is the first major economy to legalize recreational marijuana, and shares in cannabis producers have rallied in anticipation. New Cannabis Ventures\u0027 global cannabis stock index has risen about 87 per cent over the past year. Several US states have legalized marijuana but it remains against federal law. Cannabis\u0027 legal status is being reviewed by the UK government - so what does this actually mean? Currently, cannabis is a Class B drug and that is not going to change. That means possession will still carry an unlimited fine and up to five years\u0027 jail - rising to 14 years for dealers. And recreational use will be illegal. But the \u0027schedule\u0027, which sets out how a drug can be used for medical purposes, is now being reviewed by the Home Office. Currently, cannabis is Schedule 1 - meaning it has \u0027no therapeutic value\u0027 in the eyes of the law. If a medical benefit is identied, that schedule will change, meaning you could get it on prescription. This would likely only apply to certain forms like cannabis oil, rather than leaves that can be smoked. Separately, there is already a system where patients can get a \u0027licence\u0027 to use cannabis, even though it\u0027s against the law. This is very rare but has happened in the cases of epileptic boys Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell. This licensing system is also being overhauled, with a new panel of medical experts set up to advise the Home Office on future cases."},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane florence boy one found","story":"NewsHurricane Florence: Boy, one, found dead in North Carolina floodwater after losing grip of desperate mumThe death toll from the extreme weather - which has been downgraded to a tropical depression - has risen to 18 with flood water cutting off a city of more than 100,00 peopleShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter16:51, 17 SEP 2018Updated17:00, 17 SEP 2018NewsKaiden Lee-Welch lost grip of his mum as they both battled in flood water\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A one-year-old boy has become the latest victim of Hurricane Florence in the United States, taking the death toll to 18.  Rescue workers near Charlotte, North Carolina recovered the body of Kaiden Lee-Welch who had slipped out of his mother’s hands after their car got stuck in floodwater on Sunday evening.  Rescue teams searched overnight for the boy after rushing water pushed his mother\u0027s car off the road, the Union County Sherf\u0027s Office said on Facebook .  The mother had driven around barricades on a closed stretch of road, the post said. Police wrote: The mother... continued traveling east until her vehicle encountered rushing water flowing across the road.  Her vehicle left the roadway and came to rest amongst a group of trees.  She managed to free herself and Kaiden, who was in a car seat, but lost her grip on him in the rushing water.  The city of Wilmington, with roughly 119,000 residents, has been cut off with most routes to it submerged in floodwater. Evacuation orders are still being issued as rivers rise and dams are tested. The authorities in Hoke County, west of Fayetteville, told residents late Sunday to flee “due to the possible breach of the dam, reports the New York Times. At least 18 people have died in storm-related incidents, including a man and a woman in Horry County, S.C. who died from carbon monoxide poisoning.  Isolated tornadoes were also a threat on Monday, and forecasters issued about two dozen tornado warnings in North Carolina before 8am local time.  Florence was a tropical depression on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph  as it headed through Virginia  and toward New England.  With the rain and winds headed north, some residents in North and South Carolina started to  to their homes as the sun peeked through the clouds briefly for the first time in days. Tens of thousands of houses have been damaged, but for many parts of the Carolinas, the worst is yet to come as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service.

The Buk missile was built at a plant near Moscow during the Cold War and delivered to Ukraine in 1986 when it was a Soviet republic, the Kremlin claims. A team of international investigators has pointed the blame at Moscow, saying videos and other evidence show a missile launcher being secretly transported into territory held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The investigators claim a Russian-made Buk missile brought down the jet and the launcher used in the air disaster - which killed all 298 passengers and crew onboard - belonged to Russia\u0027s military.  But Russia\u0027s Ministry of Defence claims those videos have been manipulated, and denies claims that Moscow was involved in the July 2014 tragedy of the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. At a news conference on Monday, Russia\u0027s military provided an audio recording which it claims is proof that Ukraine was involved in the air disaster. It claims that the missile used to bring down the jet was no longer in its hands.  Russian officials claim serial numbers found on missile fragments show the weapon was built in 1986 and it was owned by Ukraine when the jet was shot down. General Nikolay Parshin told reporters that the missile was sent to Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic military unit 20152, which is now the 223rd anti-aircraft defence regiment of Ukraine\u0027s armed forces. The general claims that unit was involved in Ukraine\u0027s offensive against Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region in June 2014, just weeks before the airliner was shot down.  In May, the international team of investigators, led by the Netherlands, said Russia\u0027s armed forces supplied the missile launcher that fired a Russian-made Buk missile at MH17 over the war zone. Wilbert Paulissen, head of the Netherlands\u0027 national police crime squad, said the missile was fired from Russia\u0027s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Moscow is not involved in that investigation, and claims the probe is biased.

I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points.

This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out. Still, seven points from the last nine after a tricky start to the season is not too bad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/VA-Dundee-promo.jpg ","title":"ray mckinnon dundee tried to punt ex captain darren odea to falkirk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Falkirk manager Ray McKinnon has revealed the deadline day madness at the Championship strugglers – and even had a Dundee defender offered to him with just minutes to go till the window slammed shut.The former Dundee United boss was only in the door for a few hours after his shock switch from Greenock Morton.McKinnon managed to seal a deal for Rangers striker Zak Rudden on loan but narrowly missed out on former Tannadice loanee Anthony Ralston.He also revealed Dundee boss Neil McCann offered the services of former skipper Darren O’Dea as the clock ticked towards midnight.McKinnon said: “We had Darren O’Dea getting punted to us at 10.30 at night by Neil McCann.

We’ve been rehearsing and have just played at the Glenfiddich Festival Experiment so we’re on a roll. We can’t wait to play for everyone.”Dundee two-piece St Martiins are next up, performing a set at 12.40pm. Featuring Katie Lynch and Mark Johnston, they claim to have crafted a “unique sound” through music “laced with dark tones”.Katie said: “The V\u0026ampA is bringing something new to the creative scene here in Dundee, which has been needing a good refresh. We’re extremely lucky as a band and I want to see more people get the chance to get involved in the music business. Today’s going to be great – we’re so happy that we were asked.”At 1.30pm is Andrew Wasylyk, the alias of Dundee writer and producer Andrew Mitchell.He describes his work as being “cinematic nostalgia” with “elements of Baroque pop and the influence of classic 1970s songwriters”. Andrew said: “It’s a privilege to be involved and to play a small part in the opening of this new chapter for the city. I’m a fan of Kengo Kuma’s architecture and I’m excited to see the V\u0026ampA evolve and grow with the local communities. I’m really looking forward to performing with a nine-piece ensemble.”Kyle Falconer  – frontman of The View – is the most familiar name on the bill and he will appear on-stage at 2.30pm. The Dryburgh lad has been on tour promoting his debut solo album No Thank You of late, and is expected to perform hits from that LP along with a few well-known tunes from the band that made him famous.Another familiar face appears at 3.30pm in Be Charlotte  – the stage name of local singer Charlotte Brimner.She continues to make a name for herself, having signed a record deal earlier this year and performed last night before Primal Scream on the first day of the 3D Festival.Rounding the day off will be Danny Wilson icon Gary Clark, who’ll play a solo set to his hometown from 4.30pm before being joined by Sistema – the children’s schools orchestra – at 4.50pm to bring the festival to a close. Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/VA-Dundee-promo.jpg ","title":"va dundee huge queue as museum opens to wider public after debut weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA large queue of eager visitors has formed as people aim to get their first glimpse of the V\u0026ampA Dundee.After a weekend of celebrations and exclusive access to lucky ballot winners, the museum opened its doors to the general public.The iconic building officially opened at 10am today.\u0026mdash Mary\u0026#39sChapelProject  September 17, 2018Shortly after the opening time, a large queue had formed \u0026#8211 stretching past the RRS Discovery.The iconic £80 million museum welcomed thousands of visitors over Saturday and Sunday.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 2:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117443.jpg","title":"Family support group lends a helping hand","story":"\u0026nbspTHE family of a Black Isle father-of-three who took his own le after he struggled to cope with depression believe they are now helping others to handle their grief.More than 80 people so far have attended Patrick and Wendy Mullery\u0027 suicide support group, which was founded in memory of their son James.The 28-year-old car salesman died last October.The Mullerys, of Bayview Crescent, Cromarty, together with James\u0027 long-term partner Jodie, who is the mother of his three children, run the monthly meet-up at Mercure Inverness Hotel, paying the heavily-discounted room hire cost out of their own pockets.Mr Mullery , a commercial waste manager for Highland Waste Services in Invergordon, said he was surprised at the group\u0027 high turnout, which is now gearing up for its sixth session.\"It\u0027 more than we expected which just shows there is a need,\" he said.\"People come along and just share their experiences.

Additional allowances are also paid for summer holidays, Christmas and birthdays.Foster carers do not have to own their own home and do not need to be married. They can also be single or living with someone, including in a same-sex relationship. They can be from any ethnic background.Training and support is provided.For more information on fostering, contact 01463 702743 or email fostering@highland.gov.ukTuesday 18 Sep 2018 2:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117425.jpg","title":"Gay parade plan for Inverness prompts petition","story":"\u0026nbspHUNDREDS of people have signed a petition opposing a planned parade in Inverness city centre to celebrate gay culture, describing it as unsavoury and deeply offensive.The organisers of Proud Ness, set to take place on October 6, have applied for permission to stage a march along High Street to Eden Court Theatre.But Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , has gathered about 600 names on a petition opposing the parade on moral, religious and biblical grounds and also written a letter to Highland Council.Mr Morrison, of Old Edinburgh Road, Inverness, claimed in gay marches elsewhere members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender  community flaunted their immorality in the most extravagant ways imaginable.\"This becomes evident especially in city centres when they thrust lewdness in the faces of men, women and children alike by frolicking unashamedly on rainbow-coloured floats making obscene sexual gestures,\" he said.\"If this unsavoury event is given planning permission then these desperately sad scenes are now likely to be witnessed very tragically in Inverness on October 6.\"Mr Morrison said the city streets were public places and should be kept child-friendly, family-friendly and people-friendly but maintained this was not the case when immoral behaviour and lestyles were promoted in their spaces.The petition includes signatures from across the region including Ullapool and Skye,\u0026nbsp although Mr Morrison said most were from Inverness and included Christians and non-Christians.

Tony Watt was lurking unmarked at the back post for a cross but Andy Considine cut it out with a last gasp clearance for a corner.Aberdeen were looking vulnerable down the flanks and were also offering very little in terms of attack.It was grim viewing for the travelling Red Army.In the 31st minute Saints again threatened when Blair Aston sent a 15 yard glancing header along the face of goal and wide.A first shot of note on target from the Dons finally came in the 35th minute when Gleeson released Logan down the right flank with a cross-field ball.That was the only real effort from the Dons in a grim first 45 minutes for the Pittodrie side.McInnes changed it at half-time by bringing on striker Sam Cosgrove for Forrester.Within a minute of the restart McGinn was denied when his powerful 22 yard drive was pushed wide by keeper Clark.Winger Mackay-Steven injected real urgency when he picked up the ball on the right and cut across into a more central position.He unleashed a vicious 20 yard drive that Jason Kerr headed off the line with the keeper beaten.Moments later Shinnie fired a low drive wide from the edge of the box.Aberdeen did more in attack in the first five minutes of the second half than in the entire first 45 minutes.Keeper Clark did well to get down and block a low drive from Mackay-Steven at his near post.The Dons were denied in the 62nd minute when substitute Cosgrove latched onto a cross 12 yards out delivered by Logan.Cosgrove headed downwards but was denied by a superb save from Clark.Aberdeen were vastly improved in the second half and were running rampant.The goal the Dons second half play merited finally arrived in the 69th minute via a superb free-kick from McGINN.The winger lted a 19 yard effort up over the defensive wall and beyond the ing Clark into the top corner for a deserved equaliser.Moments later Joe Lewis saved a powerful drive from Blair Alston.

A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identication. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September. For the year so far that’s over 200 kids\u0026#8217 days out in total with around 60 kids at the Oban festival and around 70 kids at the Campbeltown festival.With funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust and the Ventient Energy A\u0026#8217 Cruach Community Fund administered by Foundation Scotland it is hoped to increase the number of festivals kids can attend and to get more teams through to Lochgilphead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"come on scotland","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/09/18, 5:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA healthy Mid Argyll support will be at Hampden this evening  to see Scotland take on face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium at Hampden Park.A bus load of 40 youngsters from Lochgilphead Soccer Centre headed off to Glasgow on Friday afternoon to cheer on Scotland in their friendly game.The match is a warm-up before the serious business begins on Monday September 10 as Scotland begin the inaugural Nations League at home to Albania.Here we go again.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

MTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country. Now Furys has been selected as one of the elite for broadcast. MTV will provide a DJ for the night and all revellers have to do is turn up and get their groove on. Furys manager Steven Muir said: “MTV are doing a freshers’ tour for filming and they asked  we want to be part of it. “They were targeting big university cities and some towns. “They picked us as they had seen we won the nightclub award and UWS had grown in stature.” Steven said Furys is getting bigger and better and they are delighted to be selected as one of the clubs to be filmed.  He added: “MTV film the night and it will be aired later on in the spring on the Club MTV chance. “This is the people of Ayr’s chance to get on TV, so what we have done is ask that people come dressed smart and show off the town. “It will just be a normal night in Furys, and they asked to do it on one of our iconic nights. “So Skints on a Thursday was chosen, as that’s a busy night for students and has been running for about 10 years. “We sold out all the booths within a few hours of advertising, and the tickets are flying off the shelves. “I am advising everyone to get tickets soon, as this will no doubt be a full house.” The event occurs on Thursday, October 4 at Furys Nightclub on Nile Court.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further

the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum.

by council planning officers.\u0026nbsp\nRobin Purdie, of High Cross Avenue, Melrose, wants to convert 37 Bank Street into a mortgage shop, but has been refused permission despite the building laying empty for the last two years.\nThe property is currently categorised as a retail or food outlet, and converting the shop into a financial services outlet would require planning permission for a change of use.\nMr Purdie has now appealed to the Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos local review body, where councillors will be asked to either refuse the application or overturn the planning department\u0026rsquos decision.\u0026nbsp\nIn his request for a review, Mr Purdie wrote: \u0026ldquoMy company has had an offer accepted to purchase 37 Bank Street, which has been empty and on the

currently based in Edinburgh, but I am a born and bred Borderer who has been arranging mortgages around the Borders for the last 18 years.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThus fair, change of use has been

that Galashiels is open to inward investment from businesses that want to relocate there.\nFootfall in Scottish Borders town centres has fallen dramatically over the last decade, leading to an increase in empty shops.\nGalashiels has been especially hard hit, with a recent retail survey showing that 37 retail units are currently standing empty in the town centre.\nRecently, the council agreed to relax restrictions on businesses opening up in Galashiels as part of a retail pilot aimed at reversing the decline in footfall and occupancy rates.\nLeisure businesses, professional or financial services and non-residential institutions will now be tolerated along the town\u0026rsquos two main shopping streets, and businesses such as tattoo shops and travel agents will be able to open providing they can prove they will generate footfall for the area.\nIn explaining their reasons for refusing Mr Purdie\u0026rsquos application, planning officers stated: \u0026ldquoAny continued

formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer  members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again ening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.  Darren\u0026rsquos mum, Shirley, has been busy ensuring it is a fun day at the lighthouse.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.  Filmed over the summer in Glasgow, the show sees five contestants begin the game with a case containing a secret amount of cash. Players answer questions to win visits to a soundproof vault where they can see inside their opponents\u0026rsquo cases. The twist: they don\u0026rsquot know how much is in their own case.  In a fast-paced endgame, players attempt to steal each other\u0026rsquos cases via tense head-to-head challenges, but only the player who gets over the finish line first will win what is inside their case. There is a potential jackpot of \u0026pound5,000.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos totally dferent to other game shows, Debs told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a good bit of comedy in it, which is why I\u0026rsquom there.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot speak, it\u0026rsquos all just done with my eyes and facial expressions.

The 45-minute show starts on Monday at 2.15pm on BBC One and\u0026nbspruns for 20 episodes.  Explaining how the role came about, Debs said: \u0026ldquoI basically got a call asking  I could speak to production. It was quite surreal. I didn\u0026rsquot have to audition or anything.  The stage is nothing new for the former Centre Stage director. She left the theatre group in 2016 to give herself \u0026ldquoa wee chance and still acts in local productions.  She now runs Quirky Pond, a theatre company, with friend Yvonne Rowley. Their next show is The Naked Truth, running on November 2 and 3.  \u0026ldquoQuirky Pond is getting bigger and bigger, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe Naked Truth will have two days at The Brunton [in Musselburgh].  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about five women who take up pole dancing classes, for a iety of reasons. One of the characters finds out she has cancer, so she wants to have a fundraiser.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a mix between Calendar Girls and The Full Monty but we all keep our clothes on.  But Debs still keeps an eye on Centre Stage with everything else going on.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove offered to help  they need me but I think they\u0026rsquore doing quite well themselves, she said.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom going to try and get to their panto this year.  \u0026ldquoNext year is their 40th year, so it\u0026rsquos a big anniversary for them.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.  According to the planning officer\u0026rsquos report: \u0026ldquoIn a supporting statement submitted with the application it is stated that the proposal is part of Tarmac\u0026rsquos long-term internal upgrade and modernisation programme at Dunbar cement works.  \u0026ldquoIt asserts that the cement mill is necessary to produce new grades of cement required for modern construction and the cement market.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed mill will replace two existing mills on the site and will be more energy-efficient and quieter than those existing mills.  \u0026ldquoThe supporting statement also asserts that the cement works benefits from rail sidings on both the south and north side of the East Coast Mainline.  \u0026ldquoTrains run under a load out structure that feeds cement into rail tankers.  \u0026ldquoAt present, trains are fed only on the south side using adjacent silos where train capacity is already fully used.  \u0026ldquoAdditional products must therefore be exported by road.  \u0026ldquoUntil the late 1980s, the northern siding was also fed by a large silo that was dismantled. It is now proposed to reinstate a modern silo on this side to increase rail capacity.  Oliver Curtin, Dunbar Cement Plant manager, was pleased that permission had been granted, with further permissions to be secured before work gets under way, with staff levels to remain the same.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore pleased that East Lothian Council has approved our application to upgrade the facilities at Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThe plans will allow us to bring the latest technology to our operations, build on our offer to customers and maximise use of the rail network for transportation across Scotland and England.  \u0026ldquoWe will now work with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to secure appropriate operating permits.  \u0026ldquoOnce the necessary environmental permissions are in place, we will create a detailed plan for construction and operational timescales."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-pub-named-scotlands-best","story":"  The Volunteer Arms, known as Staggs, has been named\u0026nbspthe best pub in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Thursday\u0026rsquos vote will not occur.  President Donald Trump telegraphed earlier on Monday that that schedule might slip. He told reporters at the White House: \u0026ldquoIf it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay.  If the Judiciary committee\u0026rsquos timetable slips, it would become increasingly dficult for Republicans to schedule a vote before the November 6 elections.  With fragile Republican majorities of just 12-11 on the Judiciary committee and 51-49 in the full Senate, Republican leaders had little room for defectors without risking a humiliating defeat of Mr Trump\u0026rsquos nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.  Among the Republican defectors was Senator Jeff Flake, a Judiciary Committee member who has clashed bitterly with Mr Trump and is retiring from the Senate.  Mr Flake said he told number two Senate Republican leader John Cornyn on Sunday that \u0026ldquo we didn\u0026rsquot give her a chance to be heard, then I would vote no.  There was enormous pressure on Republican Sensators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, two moderates who have yet to announce their positions on Mr Kavanaugh and are not on the Judiciary Committee.

Earlier, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said it would be \u0026ldquoa deep insult to the women of America  Mr Grassley did not postpone Thursday\u0026rsquos meeting.  Mr Kavanaugh and Ms Ford had each indicated earlier on Monday a willingness to testy to the Judiciary committee.  Debra S Katz, Ms Ford\u0026rsquos lawyer, said on NBC\u0026rsquos Today show that Ms Ford was ready to testy publicly to the Judiciary panel, but she did not respond on Monday evening to efforts to learn whether she would appear.  Mr Kavanaugh, 53, whose confirmation had seemed to be on a smooth trajectory, went to the White House on Monday.  Mr Trump said he did not meet with his nominee and declined to say whether Mr Kavanaugh had offered to withdraw, dismissing the question as \u0026ldquoridiculous.  Ms Ford, now a psychology professor at Calornia\u0026rsquos Palo Alto University, told The Washington Post that an intoxicated Mr Kavanaugh corralled her into a bedroom at a Maryland party when she was around 15 and Mr Kavanaugh was about 17, held her down on a bed, tried to undress her and held his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream.  She said she got away when a companion of Mr Kavanaugh\u0026rsquos jumped on him.

It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9.

He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-on-sunday-diary-grunts-screams-and-funny-names-it-must-be-the-work-of-the-hand-of-god","story":"  Watching last weekend\u0026rsquos US Open tennis final, the loud grunts coming from the players as they served and ed the ball sounded like two disgruntled jungle primates preparing to have a square go. However,  you were a mammal vocalisation researcher listening in \u0026ndash yes there are such people! \u0026ndash you would have been able to tell whether the winner was going to be Novak Djokovic or Juan Martin Del Potro and put your money on Novak to beat the bookies\u0026rsquo odds.  We know that grunting can distract an opponent \u0026ndash one Dutch player was once docked a point for counter-grunting \u0026ndash and can also help a player to hit signicantly harder, but predicting the outcome by grunt? Apparently so. Last year three such researchers at the University of Sussex published a paper in the journal Animal Behaviour entitled \u0026ldquoTennis Grunts Communicate Acoustic Cues to Sex and Contest Outcome. The conclusion was that, when winning, players\u0026rsquo grunts are lower pitched and losers pitch higher.  So  you\u0026rsquore a grunt aficionado you\u0026rsquod be able to confound the Ladbrokes algorithm and cash in. The lead researcher, one Jordan Raine, analysed 394 ying grunts from Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the 2011 Wimbledon final and built his research from there. Nadal\u0026rsquos grunt apparently reveals \u0026ldquodeterministic chaos, akin to a motorbike erupting, while Djokovic\u0026rsquos ies a lot, but the one constant is something that sounds like a stled sneeze. Raine \u0026ndash where did he get the grant for this? That\u0027s what I want to know \u0026ndash also goes to drama schools to clock the sounds budding actors make when they\u0026rsquore told to imagine themselves in a war, or giving birth or falling from a tall building, or perhaps even being in a tennis final?  Raine, an Andy Murray fan, watched our boy in the second round of the US Open against Fernando Verdasco and knew from the first set it wasn\u0026rsquot going to end well because Verdasco\u0026rsquos pitch became lower while Murray just sounded like he was tired and wanted to go home to put his feet up. The denouement became inevitable when Verdasco served and loudly grunted what sounded like \u0026ldquoAu revoir. It was.  SCREAMS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE  Still in the strange but true and absolutely irrelevant category, going up to 11 on the Richter scale of sound effects, is the Wilhelm Scream, the most famous and most-used one in movie history, ululating in more than 370 films to date, from Toy Story to Star Wars \u0026ndash where Luke Skywalker shoots a Stormtrooper on the Death Star who falls off the edge \u0026ndash to Lord of the Rings and Reservoir Dogs.  The effect was called Wilhelm after the on-screen name of an actor who gives it out as he is hit by an arrow in the 1953 Western Charge at Feather River. But it was actually created two years earlier in a Raoul Walsh oater, Distant Drums, starring Gary Cooper, where a soldier is dragged underwater by an alligator and as he goes lets out the bellow. It was dubbed-on in post production by the musician and actor Sheb Wooley who was working on the film as a voice extra.  Wooley has never received proper credit for the scream, nor, I doubt, residuals for re-use. And he certainly shouldn\u0026rsquot get any credit for bringing out possibly the worst-ever song in popular music, The Purple People Eater. It was covered by our own teen pop star in a kilt, Leith\u0027s own Jackie Dennis, in 1958. And by Judy Garland.  In the trivia of unwanted facts useful only in a pensioners\u0026rsquo pub quiz it also went to Number One in Finland, recorded by British comedian Barry Cryer.  COLD COMFORT  The family-owned clothing company Johnstons of Elgin reports a record year in turnover and profits, and work at its mills in Hawick and Elgin is booming.  A growing liking for cashmere knitwear by customers in warm climates, like Panama and Dubai, is largely responsible, which seems like a bit of a contradiction in terms, not to say climates. But apparently it\u0026rsquos because shoppers frequent air-conditioned malls and  it gets a bit parky they pop into a shop and purchase a fleecy warm jumper.  International sales are up a whopping 30 per cent. The \u0026ldquooutstanding results were reported by the company\u0026rsquos managing director.

NEW ROLE FOR THE HAND OF GOD  On Wednesday last week, the French sports diary L\u0026rsquoEquipe published a rather cruel cartoon about Diego Maradona as the news came out that he\u0026rsquos been appointed manager of a Mexican side.  I\u0026rsquove been rather fond of him since witnessing his first international goal for Argentina against Scotland, of course, at Hampden Park in 1979.  It\u0026rsquos been all downhill since he stopped playing, with ballooning weight. He\u0027s also a recovering drug addict.  He also collapsed rather dramatically in a box \u0026ndash not the penalty one \u0026ndash watching Argentina against Nigeria in the World Cup in June. Now, rather strangely, he\u0026rsquos been made boss of Dorados, third bottom of the Mexican second ision. The club is based in Culiac\u0026aacuten, which is the home of the Sinaloa drug cartel. Perhaps he just wanted to cut out the middle men?  MILLAR\u0026rsquoS CROSSING  The professional cycling union, the CPA , is about as democratic as Stalin\u0026rsquos USSR, with Chris Froome calling it a dictatorship, joined by the present Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas firing his own broadside at the establishment.  The presidency is up for the vote in nine days with the incumbent, Gianni Bugno, going for re-election. Under the rules riders can only vote  they turn up to the meeting, which is in Innsbruck, and given the pro racing season is still going strong it\u0026rsquos not very likely that many will.  The sport has often been in the news for all the wrong reasons, or the pre-eminent one, drugs. In one of those gambits you might describe as setting a gamekeeper to catch a thief  step forward the challenger to Bugno, Scotland\u0026rsquos own David Millar.

A new report says just one in ten Scots think that the UK government has managed immigration competently and fairly and the authors say urgent action is need to restore public trust. Across the UK they are slightly more supportive with only 15% backing Britain\u0027s handling of immigration.  The figures come from the largest-ever public consultation on immigration, ahead of the independent Migration Advisory Committee\u0026rsquos immigration report on Tuesday expected to be pivotal to shaping Theresa May\u0026rsquos post-Brexit immigration policy.    Nicola Sturgeon has made repeated calls for a Scottish-specic immigration system in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  But the Home Office believes that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would complicate the system, harming its integrity, and cause dficulties for employers who they say need the flexibility to deploy their staff to dferent parts of the UK.  It says that it will engage with and consider the views of the Scottish Government and businesses when deciding on any action over the MAC findings.  The new report from the National Conversation on Immigration, co-ordinated by think tank British Future and anti-prejudice campaigners HOPE not hate, said that even the English agreed that Scotland should take control.  Some 55% across the UK said the devolved governments should have powers over immigration. The policy is also supported by half of those who live in the Midlands  and the south east  and by Leave  and Remain  voters.    Stuart McDonald, the SNP spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control said: \u0026ldquoThe support for devolution of migration powers recorded by the National Conversation is hugely signicant and welcome. Not only in Scotland, but across the UK, people have had enough of one-size-fits-all migration rules and do not believe that the UK government will deliver competent or fair migration policies.  \u0026ldquoIt is more urgent that ever for the UK government to devolve migration powers to the Scottish Parliament, so we can build a system that is designed to meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and aspirations \u0026ndash for example, a post-study work visa, rules that allow families to stay together, and visas that encourage people to work, start businesses and invest here.  The First Minister has argued that Scotland needs power over immigration to attract more people north of the border where there is a rapidly ageing population.    But earlier this month, CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn, one of the most influential figures in British industry said that businesses are not ready for a separate Scottish immigration system.  Earlier this month, the Home Secretary unveiled a pilot scheme that will allow fruit and vegetable growers to recruit non-EU migrants as seasonal workers - but critics say it goes \"nowhere near\" far enough to plug a recruitment crisis in Scots fruit-picking industry.  The new report calls for an annual \u0026lsquoMigration Day\u0026rsquo in Parliament, where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy that it says should replace the annual net migration target, and would have input from the devolved administrations.    Jill Rutter, director of strategy for British Future and co-author of the report, said: \u0026ldquoThe lack of trust we found in the government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.  \u0026ldquoWhile people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.  Rosie Carter of HOPE not hate, co-author of the report, added: \u0026ldquoImmigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens. Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference \u0026ndash that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.  \u0026ldquoAn official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.    The research by ICM for the National Conversation, which polled 700 people in Scotland also found Scots were more positive about integration with 69% agreeing \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate, compared to 61% UK-wide.  And just 31% in Scotland agree that \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home\" against 39% UK-wide.  But the report also uncovered some dissenting voices in citizens\u0027 panels held across Scotland.  In four of the five citizens\u0026rsquo panels in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh and Paisley \u0026ndash some participants felt that international students were taking the place of Scottish students.  \"This view was more surprising, given that these four citizens\u0026rsquo panels held many positive views about other forms of migration,\" said the report.  Students who live in Scotland or are from EU countries do not have to pay tuition fees in Scottish universities.    \"This seems to have fuelled a belief that Scotland\u0026rsquos universities prioritise international students from outside the EU over Scottish students for financial reasons,\" said the report.  \"However, our nationally representative ICM survey did not indicate any statistically signicant dference in the desire to reduce the number of international students in Scotland  compared with all of the UK .\"  And some over two out of three Scots were happy for the numbers of international students to be increased or remain at the same level.  The Home Office said: \"Our immigration system is designed to work for the whole of the UK. We have no current plans to introduce a devolved immigration system.  \"Scotland, as well as other devolved governments, have dferent ways available to encourage more iniduals and families to move to their part of the UK.  National Conversation on Immigration researchers held over 130 meetings in 60 locations across every nation and region of the UK, with citizens\u0026rsquo panels, recruited to be representative of the local population, in each place alongside meetings with local government, businesses, faith and civil society groups.  In Scotland, panels were held in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Lerwick and Paisley.  Nationally representative research by ICM polled 3,667 people across the UK and an open online survey was completed by nearly 10,000 people.  Other Scottish findings  \u0026bull 62% agree that migrant workers support the British economy by doing jobs British people don\u0026rsquot want to do  \u0026bull 51% agree that public services are under strain because of immigration  \u0026bull 64% agree that migrants bring valuable skills for our economy and public services like the NHS  \u0026bull 51% agree that migrants are willing to work for less money so put jobs at risk and lower wages  \u0026bull 80% think the number of high-skilled migrants from the EU should remain the same or increase while 11% say they should be reduced.  \u0026bull 47% would like the number of low-skilled workers from the EU to be reduced while 34% think they should stay the same and 9% would like more.  \u0026bull 63% agree that the public should be consulted more on important national issues, like immigration.  Analysis:\u0026nbspScottish public are balancers  by Jill Rutter, Director of Strategy for British Future and co-author of the National Conversation on Immigration final report.    Immigration was one of the biggest issues of the EU referendum, but the public have not had a chance to say what should happen next.  The National Conversation on Immigration, jointly conducted by British Future and Hope not hate, is the largest ever public consultation on immigration.  Holding sixty citizens\u0026rsquo panels across the UK, including five in Scotland and a mixed English-Scottish panel in Berwick, it was a chance to hear the public\u0026rsquos voice.  These real-world conversations were constructive and pragmatic, in sharp contrast\u0026nbspto the more polarised online debate. We heard dferent views across Scotland: in Paisley, local faith and political leadership had shaped a public discourse that was more sympathetic to refugees and migrants than in similar places south of the border.  In Aberdeen, awareness of migration\u0026rsquos contribution to the oil industry was mixed with concerns about pressures on school places and housing. The Berwick citizens\u0026rsquo panel showed that views on migration can be toughest in places of low ersity and least contact.  Scotland has a distinctly more positive national immigration discourse. The Scottish public are balancers, seeing the gains of migration for the NHS and economy and wanting practical plans to manage the pressures too.  Asked to rate the overall impact of immigration on a 1-10 scale, the most common Scottish response is six out of ten, with a modest dference between the Scottish  and UK-wide  averages.  Views about whether Scotland should have more control over immigration policy often ided along independence referendum lines. There was more support in Paisley, while citizens in the Shetlands were firmly opposed.  But the sense that Westminster is distant and unlikely to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs transcends the independence question: a pro-Union panel in Edinburgh felt the City of London would dominate in decisions about future policy.  So 64% of Scots support devolving immigration powers, according to the survey that formed part of the National Conversation.    While political, business and civic society stakeholders saw a clear demographic need for immigration in Scotland, it was striking how the public were barely aware of the debate about future population needs. Scotland\u0026rsquos immigration \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo will be ready to hear that case, but a sustained national conversation on Scotland\u0026rsquos demographics will be needed for elite debate to be converted into a public one."},{"url":null,"title":"snps-brendan-ohara-calls-on-chancellor-to-continue-duty-freeze-on-scotch-whisky","story":"  Nationalist MP Brendan O\u0026rsquoHara, who chairs Westminster\u0026rsquos all-party parliamentary group on scotch whisky, echoed industry concerns, saying it was vital that businesses and sectors were protected and not burdened with a counterproductive and unnecessary tax hike.  He said: \u0026ldquoScotch whisky is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos major assets and a global success story. At a time of continued Brexit uncertainty and instability, we cannot risk or undermine our whisky industry by increasing the tax liability on our producers who are already contributing so much.  \u0026ldquoDespite the Treasury predicting lost revenues of \u0026pound225 million from the November duty freeze, they actually rose by \u0026pound113m. By contrast, when the Treasury increased revenues the previous March by 3.9per cent, revenues dropped by 7.2 per cent. Scotch whisky cannot be forced to bankroll the UK\u0026rsquos failing economic strategy, declared the Argyll and Bute MP.  \u0026ldquoFor too long the Treasury has viewed the industry as a \u0026lsquocash cow\u0026rsquo, as evidenced by last year\u0026rsquos counterproductive duty hike. That approach must come to an end and I call on the Chancellor to rule out unnecessary tax hikes and instead take heed of the economic reality and retain the duty freeze on scotch whisky to ensure that this vital Scottish industry continues to grow, he added.  The SNP stressed that scotch whisky was responsible for approximately a fth of UK food and drink exports and recently reported record numbers of visitors to distilleries and tourist centres. The industry supported more than 40,000 jobs directly and through its supply chain, it noted.  The Scotch Whisky Association \u0026ndash the sector\u0026rsquos trade body \u0026ndash has already said that a continued freeze would \u0026ldquonot only deliver greater revenue for the Treasury but also help to support an industry that has invested more than \u0026pound500m in capital projects over the last five years.  The Budget date is not yet known and it is thought Mr Hammond is waiting to name a date until there is clarity over the success or otherwise of the Brexit talks.

Writing in the Observer, Mr Khan warned the UK faced either a bad deal or no-deal, saying: \"They are both incredibly risky and I don\u0027t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people\u0027s livelihoods.  Calling for another referendum, the London Mayor added: \"This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the Government or a vote on a no-deal Brexit  one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU.

As the town continued to expand so, too, did the print industry, alongside the trade in American tobacco and cotton, and Caribbean sugar.  The city had its first newspaper in late 1715, when the Glasgow Courant opened for business. In 1783 came the weekly Glasgow Advertiser, which in 1805 changed its name to the Glasgow Herald.  Now all of the city\u0026rsquos newspaper, book and commercial printing history has been assembled in the Glasgow Print Trail, a booklet and -  there is sufficient interest - a guided, physical trail for visitors to follow.  Maps in the booklet show the geographical spread of printing businesses. Many were clustered in the city centre. Among them were the Foulis Press, 18th century publishers to Glasgow University, in Shuttle Street, and Bell \u0026amp Bain, book and periodical publishers, which was established in Glasgow Cross in 1831 and would later spend a century in Mitchell Street.  But many others were to be found outwith the city centre, including John Cossar \u0026amp Co, in Govan.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos printing industry pre-dates Glasgow\u0026rsquos by at least a century. A Print Trail has already been published, covering the capital.  The booklet is the work of the Scottish Printing Archival Trust, with funding from the Watson Foundation, which was established by John Watson OBE, who for more than half-a-century ran the well-known printers, John Watson and Company.  \u0026ldquoI would say that during the era of Glasgow being the Second City of the Empire, printing was the third or fourth largest industry in the city in terms of numbers employed, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a huge employer in those days. You had McCorquodale\u0026rsquos, which opened a print works here in the 1870s, and Robert MacLehose, who was appointed printers to the university in 1872.  \u0026ldquoThere was such a number of printers. There were many small family businesses, certainly, but you had the big boys as well.  Among the newspapers represented on the Glasgow Trail are the Glasgow Herald and Evening Times, the Daily Mail, and the Daily Record.  Mr Watson describes the booklet as a labour of love.  \u0026ldquoHaving spent my entire working le in printing I wanted to make sure that the rich history of printing in Glasgow was not forgotten. It is a story undoubtedly worth telling, he said.  \u0026ldquoMost people involved with the printing industry would generally agree that there have been more fundamental changes in the last 50 years than in the preceding centuries since Johannes Gutenberg invented printing from movable type back in 1450.  \u0026ldquoThe pace of change has been unrelenting, and with technology and new processes, the ways of communicating the printed word have changed out of all recognition. Sadly the industry has, too, and many of the companies mentioned in the booklet have fallen by the wayside.  \u0026ldquoNowadays there are so many ways of viewing or receiving information rather than from books or newspapers.  He added: \u0026ldquoFor me, the print trail is a walk down memory lane and an attempt to ensure the history of printing is not lost as the years roll by. It really was crucial to the commercial success of Glasgow and I don\u0026rsquot want that strong heritage lost in the mists of time.  \u0026ldquoIt is worth remembering that Glasgow boasted the largest book printers in the world with William Collins \u0026amp Son printing many bestsellers, including the Bible in no fewer than 42 languages. It is well known in the printing industry that every second person one who lived in Bishopbriggs worked for Collins.  Mr Watson added: \u0026ldquoThe idea is that,  there is enough interest in the Glasgow trail, we will run a guided tour, probably starting in Buchanan Street, where the Glasgow Herald was based for many decades until 1980.  Fittingly, the print-trail booklet was printed, free of charge, by Bell \u0026amp Bain, one of the oldest surviving printers in the UK, which is now based in Thornliebank.  * The booklet, researched by archivist Helen Williams, is available via www.scottishprintarchive.org for \u0026pound5."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Times are grim enough    let s not scrap free university tuition","story":"  There are bound to be feelings of excitement and trepidation for students and their parents as the academic semester begins, with the high cost of studying in 2018 doubtless contributing to worries for both parties.

The Scottish Government has always robustly resisted calls to introduce a similar scheme, despite opponents arguing the position is hypocritical, since further education places have been cut to fund the policy.

Normally I\u0026rsquom all in favour of national conversations, especially about the things that really matter. But in this case, I find myself drawn to the opposite response: now is definitely NOT the time to be having this particular debate.  At a time when many of us are already losing sleep over the potentially horrying economic ramications of Brexit, having suffered years of pitul wage growth and the chipping away of conditions that followed the financial crash, do parents really deserve the worry of an additional \u0026pound36k in fees should their children be bright enough to be offered a place at university?

Those in favour of fees talk of a very gradual introduction at a low level, but as English students learned so brutally, such promises are easily thrown out with the bathwater alongside the principle of free education.  The fee brigade in Scotland  often talk of the continuing and shameful lack of young people from deprived backgrounds going on to university, and how free higher education subsidises the middle classes.  But it\u0026rsquos impossible to see how introducing \u0026pound9k a year fees will help these young people, especially when you look again to the experience of English students: despite a massive hike in course fees over a short period, in 2016 maintenance grants for the poorest were replaced with, yes, you guessed it, loans. I speak from experience as the first person in my family to go to university and the recipient of a full grant . I may still have decided to study had fees been in place, but I doubt I would have felt free to chose the academic path I did, one that enabled me to enjoy education for its own sake but also led me to the career I love.

In further extracts from her interview, Mrs May was pushed on whether or not she had ruled out giving a special immigration arrangement for EU citizens and replied: \"What we will be doing is putting forward a set of rules for people from the European Union and people from outside the European Union.\"  She went on: \"Parliament will vote for a deal because people will see the importance of a deal that maintains a good trading relationship with the EU but also maintains good co-operation in other areas but gives us the freedom to take the benefits and opportunities of Brexit.\"  The PM cast doubt on whether or not the EU would offer a better deal  MPs were to reject her final proposal, adding: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament.  \u0026ldquoThe alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM, accused Mrs May of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit.  He explained: \"It is a deep disservice to our democratic traditions to have a Prime Minister now saying: \u0027You\u0027ve got no choices left, it\u0027s my fudge or the abyss\u0027 that is not true. We always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  \"Of all the con tricks we have been subject to in this whole sorry Brexit saga - from the lies in the referendum to the so-called virtues of what is nothing more than an inelegant fudge in Chequers - the worst is now to come, declared the former Liberal Democrat leader, who will be back in the spotlight today as he addresses a fringe event at the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Brighton.  Mr Clegg said: \"We\u0027re now going to be told: \u0027It\u0027s my way or no way\u0027 it\u0027s either the Chequers fudge or a sort of cataclysmic clf-edge.  \"The idea that the only thing this country should accept is a fudge or the abyss is not only an insult to the intelligence of British voters but it\u0027s simply not true.\"  Sir Nick insisted that his experience as an MEP taught him that Britain would be given more time by the EU to reflect on what it wanted to happen ahead of the slated withdrawal date of next March.  \u0026ldquoThe clock is ticking but the clock can definitely be changed, he declared. \u0026ldquoOne thing that is very elastic in Brussels is time. They\u0027ve got a name for it. It\u0027s called \u0027stop the clock\u0027 and it is provided for in the EU treaties.\"  The former DPM said the UK could tell Brussels: \"\u0026rsquoI\u0027m sorry, we\u0027ve got a bit stuck here, we need more time to straighten ourselves out and decide what we want to do next.\u0026rsquo\"  He called for a pause in the withdrawal process so that the UK could hold a \"People\u0027s Vote\" on Brexit.  Sir Nick was scathing about the current Brexit situation, saying: \"It\u0027s the equivalent of leaving your home, locking your front door, chucking your key away and having absolutely no idea where you are going next.\"  The former party leader, who lost his Sheffield seat at the 2017 General Election, said he had been holding talks with European leaders on the Brexit situation to ensure the UK had more choices on what to do about its relationship with the EU.  In her BBC interview broadcast tonight, Mrs May also said she gets \u0026ldquoirritated by the debate about her leadership and criticised Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos controversial \u0026ldquosuicide vest comment.  Britain is heading full throttle for a total write-off of Brexit  it continues with Theresa May\u0027s disastrous plans for the Irish border, Boris Johnson has claimed.  The former Foreign Secretary launched another broadside against the PM\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, saying the Irish border backstop deadlock was being used to force the UK into becoming a vassal state and that the talks were on course to end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".  Mr Johnson argued that the EU\u0026rsquos fall-back position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by Brussels.  Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he declared.  However, the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\".  His comments came as reports suggested the EU was preparing to accept the use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure.  Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.  Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.  \"If we are to get out of this mess and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels.  The former Cabinet minister claimed the EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\".  Both versions of the backstop were \u0026ldquodisastrous,\" argued Mr Johnson. \"One threatens the Union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules-takers.  \"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.  \"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name,\" he added."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8696765.jpg?type=article-full","title":"meghan-markle-cooks-in-community-kitchen-for-first-royal-job","story":"  The Duchess of Sussex visited the kitchen in January and has made a number of other private trips to the Hubb Community Kitchen to meet volunteers and learn more about their work.\u0026nbsp  She has also written the foreword to a new book \u0027Together: Our Community Cookbook\u0027, produced by the women who run the initiative, which says: \u0026nbsp\"I immediately felt connected to this community kitchen it is a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together.  :\u0026nbspHarry and Meghan \u0026lsquoholiday with the Clooneys in Italy\u0026rsquo  \"Melding cultural identities under a shared roof, it creates a space to feel a sense of normalcy - in its simplest form, the universal need to connect, nurture, and commune through food, through crisis or joy - something we can all relate to.  \"Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive.\"    Some of the recipes are family favourites and all have been created by the cooks who support not only residents affected by the Grenfell fire but others in the community.

The flawed introduction of the policy of inclusion, where pupils with conditions such as autism are taught in mainstream classes, also proved stressful.  \u0026ldquoWhen children with a iety of additional needs were included for the first time I thought it was the best thing ever, but at that time there was a great deal of funding and every child was catered for, she said.  \u0026ldquoBy the time I got to Gullane Primary funding for support was getting much tighter. In some cases, where behaviour was very challenging, I felt I could not leave the building. There was a period of two years where that happened a lot.  Mrs Tremmel now cannot see where the next crop of aspiring headteachers are going to come from.  \u0026ldquoI identied six teachers who were headteacher material, but only one took on a management role. The rest told me it just wasn\u0026rsquot worth the stress."},{"url":null,"title":"conference-sketch-corbyns-pants-mays-rubbish-and-the-lib-dems-wonderful","story":"  It could only be the Gospel according to St Nick. The onetime Deputy Prime Minister flew on angel wings to the conference fringe of the day.  Calamity can still draw the yellow faithful. A larger room had to be organised to accommodate the Clegg worshippers, clapping and cheering at their fallen hero, who unexpectedly lost his Sheffield seat in the 2017 snap poll.  Prof Clegg insisted he disagreed with Jo Swinson - never a wise move - who had cast doubt on some of the decisions of the Age of Stability that was the Lib-Con coalition.  St Nick puffed out his chest and insisted he was \u0026ldquoproud of his record in government, including \u0026ldquomassively reining in some of the darker Tory excesses.  Talking of which, he touched on his old Etonian chum that fallen Tory angel Dave. Whatever happened to him?  Cleggy, noting kindly how the thing the head Cameroon would be \u0026ldquoremembered for forever was calling that referendum, argued Dave was a \u0026ldquovery bad Conservative Prime Minister, much worse than when he led the Coalition, at which, St Nick admitted, he was adept.  Savouring the idea, Calamity pointed out that when his Tory chum finally achieved a majority government to lead in 2015, \u0026ldquoit all went utterly pear-shaped.  St Nick suggested the Tory brethren were now worshipping at the \u0026ldquotheological altar of Brexit, refusing to recognise the damage their dark religion would do the economy.  \u0026ldquoHistory will judge Theresa May very, very badly because she has allowed herself to become captive to that theological push.  Calamity\u0026rsquos blood was up.  \u0026ldquoThe extraordinary thing is this Government is so rubbish. A half decent opposition party could destroy this Government in a week. The great imponderable in British politics is how can the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn be as pants as they are. The yellow peril loved that and clapped enthusiastically.  All of which bode the obvious question:  the nasty Tories and Labour were so dire, why weren\u0026rsquot those lovely Liberals doing better in the polls the last one put them on a mighty six per cent.  St Nick blinked quickly and suggested the \u0026ldquowalloping his party received in 2015 was so hard that it would take time to recover. \u0026ldquoIt was like a boxer who was k\u0026rsquooed, as a party we were staggering around, a bit dizzy from the blows we had received.  But what was \u0026ldquowonderful about the Lib Dems was they were now recovering, \u0026ldquorattling the cage and showing their natural optimism. \u0026ldquoI genuinely think we will recover, he boomed.  And with that the lesson ended.

The Scottish Government introduced the tests to provide a more consistent way of assessing pupils across the country.  However, critics argue they are stressful for the youngest pupils and do not provide meaningful data in P1.  Writing in the Herald, the professor said: \u0026ldquoAlerting educators to misunderstandings after one year in school makes sense. Mostly teachers notice these things, but people make mistakes.  \u0026ldquoEducation can learn from other professions.

The issue of standardised assessments is to be debated on Wednesday with the Conservative Party putting forward a motion for P1 tests to be halted.

His colleague, Sir Nick Clegg, bemoaned how the Tories had abandoned their One Nation approach and had become an English National Party, indferent to Scotland and Wales.  The former Deputy Prime Minister told a conference fringe in Brighton that  the right-wingers continued to have the whip hand in the party, then separatism, which he had always opposed, would \u0026ldquoflourish.  \u0026ldquoSo, there\u0026rsquos a real danger we don\u0026rsquot lose our place in one Union, we lose our own Union as well, he warned.  Appearing on a BBC Panorama programme last night to mark six months until Brexit Day, Mrs May expressed confidence MPs would back her Chequers Plan. On Thursday, she will discuss it with fellow EU leaders over dinner at an informal summit in Salzburg.  The PM said: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament. The alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick accused her of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit between \u0026ldquomy fudge or the abyss. He insisted: \u0026ldquoWe always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  Ian Blackford, the SNP\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, was equally aghast at Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum.  \u0026ldquoIt would be utterly unforgivable to impose this reckless false choice. Theresa May must ditch her hard Brexit plans and get behind the SNP\u0027s compromise proposal to stay in the single market before it is too late,\" declared the Highland MP.  His Nationalist colleague, Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, will today warn that Mrs May is leading the UK into a \u0026ldquochaotic blind Brexit with no clarity on the country\u0026rsquos future.  \u0026ldquoIt is misleading and the height of arrogance for the Prime Minister to say the only alternative to no-deal is the Tories\u0026rsquo flawed and unworkable Chequers Plan, which even they don\u0026rsquot agree on.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has been clear that the key economic planks of the Chequers Plan are not acceptable. That means there\u0026rsquos a growing danger that we are heading for a chaotic blind Brexit in which Scotland is dragged out of the EU with key questions on trade and the future relationship undecided and in the hands of hard-line anti-Europeans, he added.  This morning, the Commons Brexit Committee issued a report urging the PM to consider alternatives to her Chequers blueprint, which kept Britain aligned to Brussels to avoid a \"chaotic and damaging\" no-deal Brexit  her plan were rejected. Three committee members \u0026ndash Tories Jacob Rees-Mogg and Andrea Jenkyns and the DUP\u0026rsquos Sammy Wilson refused to endorse it.  The report came after the International Monetary Fund said all likely Brexit scenarios would \"entail costs for the UK economy\" but that a disorderly departure could lead to \"a signicantly worse outcome\".  Chancellor Philip Hammond also warned a no-deal would jeopardise the entire economic recovery since the 2008 financial crash.  Earlier, No 10 slapped down Boris Johnson after he again used his Daily  column to attack the Chequers Plan, saying under it Britain was \"heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit\".  He complained the requirement for a \"backstop\" arrangement at the Irish border would leave the UK a \"vassal state\" of the EU.  But Downing St pointed out how the former Foreign Secretary had backed the plan while in Cabinet.  \"At the time, he congratulated the Prime Minister for her determination in securing the deal. He remained in Government for a full seven months after the joint report was agreed, said Mrs May\u0026rsquos spokesman.  Meanwhile, Labour MP David Lammy, his party colleague MEP Clare Moody and Tim Roache, the GMB General Secretary, together with party members, campaigners and activists will call for a People\u0026rsquos Vote at a march and rally in Liverpool on Sunday as the Labour Party conference kicks off.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusTuesday 18 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 17, 2018 at 3:38 pmIt has been confirmed, today, Monday, that Kirkwall is in the running to pick up a Great British High Street Award.

The poll showed that 64 per cent of Scots back immigration powers being devolved to  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.            Ten per cent of Scottish respondents think that the British Government has managed the immigration system competently and fairly.             The UK-wide trust figure was higher at 15 per cent. A consultation with almost 20,000 people across the country found just 17% trusted the government to tell the truth about the reality of immigration.Even fewer - 13% - trusted MPs to tell the truth on the issue.: Two-third of teenagers don’t want immigration to riseThe research was conducted by thinktank British Future, and anti-racism and anti-extremism charity Hope not Hate, through 130 meetings with communities in 60 locations around the UK.            They also gathered data through an online survey and opinion polling conducted by ICM Research.The report - the National Conversation on Immigration - was published ahead of the Migration Advisory Committee’s report on immigration on Tuesday.Its authors are now urging the government to use Brexit as an opportunity to rebuild trust in the immigration system.The report makes 40 recommendations for the future of immigration policy including greater resources for the Home Office to deliver its goals and a mandatory registration system and Canadian-style criminal vetting for future migration from the EU.            The authors all call for an annual “Migration Day” in parliament where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy - replacing the net migration target.: Humza Yousaf brands immigration policy cruelThey also want the government to start engaging directly with the public through an official National Conversation on Immigration run by the publicly funded Migration Advisory Committee.A spokesman for British Future said participants were asked about the level of trust in the government to manage immigration.But he added distrust has been building for 15 years following previous governments’ failure to predict the large amount of migration from recent entrants to the EU such as Poland and Romania.            Despite the low levels of trust in the present government’s ability to manage immigration, it found the majority of those involved held a more balanced view on the issue than is reflected in the media.Dubbed “balancers”, these respondents felt immigration brings economic and cultural gains to the UK, but also worry about control, fairness and pressures on public services.The research found 65% of people thought migrants bring valuable skills for the economy and public services such as the NHS, while 59% believed ersity is a good thing for British culture.A further 61% of people believed it is better for migrants to commit to remaining in the UK and to integrate, rather than coming to work for a few years before ing to their country of origin.On the other hand, 52% of respondents said public services are under strain as a result of immigration, and a further 52% believed migrants are willing to work for less - putting jobs at risk and lowering wages.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801266.1537196299!/image/image.jpg","title":"investigations into senior cops lengthy and damaging msps told","story":"        The body that represents Scotland\u0026#8217s most senior police officers has hit out at watchdogs over the \u0026#8220y and damaging\u0026#8221 investigations into allegations of misconduct.                The Scottish Chief Police Officers Staff Association  - which represents Police Scotland’s chief constable, as well as assistant and deputy chief constables - has questioned the time it takes the Scottish Police Authority  and the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner  to conclude inquiries.            In a submission to MSPs on Holyrood’s Justice Committee SCPOSA complained that “disproportionate, y and damaging enquiries appear to be undertaken with no route of challenge existing”.            The process for investigating allegations against senior officers was set out in the legislation which created Police Scotland as a national force, replacing eight regional bodies.• : Ex-police authority boss to keep £57,000 golden handshakeBut SCPOSA claimed the Police and Fire Reform  Act 2012 has “inherent flaws” which have not been addressed, despite concerns being raised with both the Scottish Government and the SPA.And with the committee now examining the impact of the legislation, it has called for a review of the accountability of both the SPA and the Pirc.It comes after former chief constable Phil Gormley quit the post in February - some five months after he had been placed on special leave amid investigations into claims of gross misconduct.            SCPOSA said Mr Gormley had “resigned before the resolution of the allegations against him despite enquiries having been ongoing for many months”.SCPOSA stressed it “unequivocally recognises the need for a fair, proportionate, transparent and robust system to deal with matters of complaint, misconduct and allegations of criminality in relation to senior officers”.But the organisation, which is chaired by Assistance Chief Constable Bernard Higgins also said it “strongly defends the rights of senior officers to be dealt with timeously, sensitively and with a recognition of the high profile and relatively vulnerable position which they hold in the policing of Scotland”.Mr Higgins had been suspended in November 2017 after allegations of misconduct were made against him - which he denies. He ed to work in March, as investigations continued.            SCPOSA said in the five years since the Act had come into force it had “become increasingly concerned regarding the  of time taken by both the SPA and PIRC to complete what have been seen as relatively straightforward enquiries or assessments”.It stated: “In many of these cases months have passed with no apparent progress and indeed no explanation of why no progress has been made.”It insisted the Scottish Government “could not have intended such delays” when it drew up the legislation, and “could not have envisaged the damage these y enquiries would cause to the reputations” of Police Scotland and officers being investigated.The submission continued: “Whilst it is accepted that enquiries into allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the most senior police officers in Scotland will always cause a signicant amount of public and press interest the level of intrusion currently being encountered could not have been anticipated at the inception of the new arrangements.“In a number of instances the Association and indeed inidual officers have only become aware of investigations into their conduct when articles have appeared in the media.            “Whilst it is unclear where such information has originated it is clear that it does signicant damage to the officers’ reputations and also to any concept of fairness of enquiries into the matters.”It added: “The Scottish Government and indeed the people of Scotland rightly expect the highest standards from senior police officers who carry signicant responsibilities and pressure.“In , the senior officers should surely be entitled to expect that when complaints are received, they are dealt with in a manner which protects their personal and professional reputations for the future.“In a number of instances this has not been the case.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800841.1537167254!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith cross border business can show benefits of the union","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

By establishing Scottish Business UK, the serial entrepreneur has ensured that business leaders no longer feel intimidated by independence campaigners into keeping their counsel when the country’s economic future is at stake.            In the 2014 referendum, instances of Scottish-based businesses speaking out about what was in their interests to ensure success – and thus create jobs and spread prosperity – were noticeably few. Kilgour often found himself a lonely figure as the only businessman willing to openly challenge the economics of the Scottish Government’s White Paper, or debate on television and radio when he knew many that privately agreed with him.             The reasons for this were many some business organisations, be they national or representing inidual sectors, felt unable to take a position for or against breaking up the UK, so chose to say nothing. Some inidual businesses felt they might become targeted for boycotts or subject to negative publicity that would lose them customers and that, commercially, saying nothing made more sense. Some businesses relied on government contracts and had no wish to put themselves at risk. After the referendum delivered its resounding defeat of independence, Robert Kilgour resolved that never again should the country’s businesses be put in such a marginal position. He decided there had to be a vehicle for business leaders with something to say, that had some useful insight to share with their employees, their customers and the wider society that benefits from the tax revenues their enterprises generate. Scottish Business UK was soon established and a board of Scots successful in their respective fields pulled together. Now Scottish Business UK is to publish tomorrow, on the fourth anniversary of the referendum that rejected independence, its first paper on why Scotland remaining in the UK is good for business. Entitled Win-Win, it argues Scotland profits in two ways, firstly through gaining signicant economic benefits that could not be improved upon but would be hugely diminished were Scotland to be outside the UK and secondly our locally-tailored public services can be more responsive to our particular needs while being underwritten through the “union idend”.The economic pluses might be obvious to many but still benefit from being repeated so they are never taken for granted. There is the tarf and regulatory free access to the UK single market for our goods, services and people, worth four times as much as the EU to our exporters. We are able to use the pound sterling at no cost to our businesses or citizens. And there is the “union idend” where beneficial fiscal transfers can ensure vital public services are maintained even when Scotland’s own tax revenues are lower than the costs of running them. Rather than deliver Westminster austerity, the union idend from the UK has helped us to avoid it. That idend was worth £11.1 billion last year – but the fact it exists rather than its amount is the most important benefit.We also know that £45.8bn or 65 per cent of all Scottish exports go to the rest of the UK, compared to £12.7bn or 17 per cent to the rest of the EU and a larger £17.1 or 20 per cent to the rest of the world. The Fraser of Allander Institute estimates that while 125,000 Scottish jobs are supported by trade with the EU, there are 529,000 Scottish jobs supported by trade with the rest of the UK.            What this tells us is that , as the Scottish Government says, we are to be concerned about the loss of frictionless trade with the EU single market following Brexit, then the risk to Scottish trade, jobs and prosperity is proportionately four times greater. Furthermore, once the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year, any deal that is agreed between the EU and UK would not automatically transfer to Scotland were it to subsequently become independent. Scotland would need to negotiate its own deal or obtain full or associate membership – paying its own membership fee, agreeing to adopt the Schengen border scheme and eventual membership of the Euro. All of these issues could impact upon the friction-free trading arrangements with the UK. Nor would negotiations be easy, Scotland’s hand would be weaker than the UK’s has been and we would need to repair relationships with countries such as Spain – or see any agreement being vetoed. Economically the optimal arrangement is to remain in the UK and benefit from all of its strengths.            Scotland remaining in the UK is not just about economics, however, it is about the close personal ties that have built up over the last 300-plus years, our shared culture and history – and how the soft power and opportunities that come from being inside the UK, and often from leading it at the political or business level, are of great value too.A timely reminder of how economic benefits come from more than just trade came with the opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee at the weekend. Much economic as well as cultural profit is expected in Dundee from the new gallery – and yet little acknowledgement has been given to the fact that V\u0026ampA Dundee is a member of the British institution and that its beneficial arrival could not have been realised in the same manner were Scotland outside the UK. Of course Dundee’s V\u0026ampA pays testimony to the cultural legacy of Scots such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Scotland’s contribution to design more generally, but as a member of the V\u0026ampA family the recognition of that contribution is elevated – while the sharing of the V\u0026ampA’s rich British archives is also made possible.Likewise, the ious city deals that are being signed off between the Scottish and UK governments – bringing over £1bn of UK funding that is outside the Scottish block grant or the Barnett Formula shows that there can be further benefits to what was being anticipated even a decade ago. The UK continues to evolve and change and Scotland can both shape that change and gain from it.Scottish business in the UK is indeed a win-win opportunity. If Robert Kilgour and his team can publish more reports that bring to our attention the quiet or untold advantages of Scotland remaining a full and active member of the UK, then his challenging experiences in the referendum will have been worthwhile.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800192.1537168158!/image/image.jpg","title":"christine jardine snp needs to make good on this vital broken promise","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Local authorities cannot afford to fix potholes and a myriad of local problems, but replacing the council tax with a land-value tax could make a real dference, writes Christine Jardine.                Sometimes politicians can be guilty of only thinking about the big picture, blue sky thinking, always looking up.            Well in Edinburgh, at the moment, that can be dangerous. Simply because you are likely to trip.            Our pavements are awful, in some places dangerous. The potholes we all complain about are not confined to the roads, which, incidentally, can also affect pedestrians and cyclists.And with winter approaching, it’s probably going to get worse.I’m sure you are probably wondering what has provoked this mini-rant? Unless, of course, you live in Edinburgh, in which case you will already know.In fact,  you live anywhere in Scotland you can probably appreciate exactly what I’m talking about.The problem was epitomised for me a couple of weeks ago when I was invited to a meeting of tenants in sheltered housing in Corstorphine.            On my way there, I had to pick my way carefully around a large pothole in the road and over an uneven – and, for the elderly, treacherous – pavement.At the meeting itself, the problems the state of the pavements was causing for residents was the main topic of discussion.And the residents, housing association and the local councillor were in complete agreement: it needs fixed.But here’s the problem. None of the people in the room, myself included, actually control the issue which is the root of the problem.            It’s the council tax and, in Edinburgh, the garden tax and the fact that it doesn’t seem to matter how much more we pay it doesn’t seem to be enough to fix the problems.To be clear though, I don’t just blame our council for that.: Cost of living crisis sparks rise in council tax warrants, Labour claimsOh, the garden tax with its extra charge for taking away garden refuse is entirely down to the SNP/Labour Edinburgh City Council. But the fact that our council tax no longer stretches to fixing the roads, the pavements, providing full grit bins, in some places not even empty grit bins, keeping public toilets open or simply providing the level of council services that the public deserves – that’s a buck which stops on a completely dferent desk.For more than a decade, the SNP Government has failed to tackle the issue of properly funding our local authorities.            For most of the SNP’s time in office, they have frozen the council tax. For nine years, in fact, as costs to councils increased and what we paid didn’t.So even though the council tax might be increased now, the block grant from Holyrood gets reduced undermining any impact it might have.And you and I are paying the price. Literally. This is not the first time, or even close to it, that I’ve written to call for something to be done about the funding of councils and services.But, as this year’s budget negotiations approach, I still nurture a faint hope that the SNP will listen to those encouraging a less centralised and damaging approach to local authority funding.It’s a policy which makes it appear that they simply do not trust the local authorities to spend money, even those where, as in Edinburgh, they are in the administration.: SNP and Tories team up to defeat Green call to scrap council taxAnd it’s a financial power-grabbing approach which increasingly extends to adding strings to any area or form of funding – teacher numbers, for example.But it’s still the council tax that the majority of us have the most direct experience of, and whose impact we feel most closely.At first, most of us backed the idea of a temporary council tax freeze.That was partly because we were all trying to cope with the personal impacts of the financial crash, and this felt like a short-term measure to help us all.Then, of course, there was the fact that the SNP had been elected in 2007 on a platform of changing the system, introducing a local income tax. The then First Minister Alex Salmond had even calledthe council “unfair”, so we expected that they would be good as their word and reform it. Well, not so much it seems.Here we are ten years later with a system that isn’t fit for purpose, councils without the resources they need and a government without the political will to fix it.Is it that they somehow don’t have constituents whose cars have been damaged by potholes? Are there no elderly residents in their areas who have suffered broken bones falling on cracked or damaged pavements? Or is it that they just are not listening? If they do pay attention they will find that the paying public want something dferent. A couple of years ago, I thought that might actually happen. There was a cross-party commission which looked at local tax reform. But Nicola Sturgeon, who had been scathing of the existing system, ignored its recommendations and instead did some tinkering around the edges.Changing Bands E to H is not reform, it’s simply more of the same. It’s time we had proper root-and-branch reform of a system which is no longer fit for purpose. Be bold. Scrap it.Most of all, let go of the strings. Let the councils respond the way they know best – because they do know best – to local problems. There is already another radical, progressive, suggestion on the table: a land-value tax.Liberal Democrats believe there are a number of economic and social benefits that could be achieved and we should be investigating it. We already know that it works well in other countries.It encourages derelict land in urban areas to be brought back into use. And  you decide to improve or extend your property you are not penalised because the tax remains based on the value of the land it is on. What do we have to lose?Next time you are frustrated by the state of the pavements, lack of services or the way you are seeing the council hamstrung at every turn by the current system of funding, take a minute and think: maybe we should do it dferently?        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796096.1536904995!/image/image.jpg","title":"richard leonard this is how we can fix scotland s broken economy","story":"        A Scottish economics education, five years working as an economist, followed by 20 years representing working people at the point of production in Scottish industry has afforded me a rare insight into the relationship between economic theory and practice.                It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800802.1537167645!/image/image.jpg","title":"gap between snp s 2014 plans and north sea revenue reaches 30bn","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The SNP should apologise for the growing black hole in the economic prospectus for independence as the shortfall in oil revenues reaches \u0026#16330 billion, Labour has demanded.                Projections in the Scottish Government’s White Paper on independence were more than ten times bigger than estimated revenue from taxes on North Sea oil and gas production in each of the past three years.            It means the shortfall in revenue is expected to reach £29.9bn by the end of this year.            On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the 2014 referendum, Scottish Labour’s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie MSP claimed the figures confirm that the economic case for independence was “nothing more than snake oil” and “a lie”.Economic projections in the 2013 White Paper were based on Scottish Government models that predicted oil prices would be broadly stable for at least two years.However, the price of crude oil plunged in the second half of 2014, as the independence referendum reached its climax, nearly halving from 112 per barrel in June to 58  in December.Oil prices hit a low of 28 in 2016 before steadily rebounding to their current level of around 75.This summer saw the publication of the SNP’s Growth Commission report, which the party hopes will convince voters that it has a more realistic economic vision of independence.            Its author, Andrew Wilson, admitted that the White Paper had a robust oil price “baked into the numbers” in 2014 but promised that a future referendum would be fought with North Sea revenues treated “as a proper windfall”.“I can say with some certainty in terms of our own work that we’ll assume for the purposes of our projections that oil is producing zero revenues and therefore treat any revenues that we get from oil as a proper windfall to be used on intergenerational projects rather than spent on spending today,” Mr Wilson said last year.Ms Baillie said: “The SNP told voters that Scotland was on the cusp of a second oil boom, and that oil was simply a bonus when it came to the costs of independence. That was simply a lie.“Instead, the figures that Nicola Sturgeon campaigned on have a £30bn black hole in them.            “That would have led to turbo-charged austerity on an unprecedented scale, with huge cuts to schools, hospitals and social welfare programmes.“These figures were baked into the promises the SNP made to some of the poorest communities in our country. It was nothing more than snake oil.”Ms Baillie added: “Nicola Sturgeon should be apologising to the people of Scotland for misleading them on an industrial scale. Rather than attempt to ide the people of Scotland again with a referendum the country does not want, it is time the SNP focused on jobs, schools and hospitals.”The SNP’s Westminster economy spokeswoman Kirsty Blackman hit back, claiming that “Labour’s only contribution as ever is to do Scotland down”.“The people of Scotland deserve an apology from Labour – who shamelessly told us voting against independence would protect our EU membership but are now working hand-in-hand with the Tories to drag us off the Brexit clf edge against our will,” Ms Blackman said.            She added: “Tory and Labour plans for a hard Brexit are by far the biggest threat to Scotland’s economy and long-term prosperity – with the potential to cut Scottish GDP by up to 9 per cent, costing £12.7bn a year and putting around 80,000 jobs on the line.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801443.1537217413!/image/image.jpg","title":"independence eight times more damaging than brexit unionists say","story":"        Independence would be eight times as costly to the Scottish economy as Brexit, campaigners against a second independence referendum have warned on the fourth anniversary of Scotland\u0026#8217s decision on its constitutional future.                Scottish Business UK, a cross-party campaign set up to represent pro-business Unionist voices, warned that the damage to trade with the rest of the UK would outstrip losses from exiting the European single market under the government’s Brexit plans, and said employers would struggle under the weight of added uncertainty.            In a report published today entitled ‘Win-Win: the business case for Scotland’s place in the UK’, campaigners claim that Scottish independence would be eight times as costly as the Scottish Government’s worst Brexit forecasts, because Scotland would lose the additional government spending per head under the Barnett Formula.            The report also highlights figures showing trade between Scotland the rest of the UK is worth three times as much to the Scottish economy as trade with the EU. The SNP called the warning “ludicrous”.Scottish Business UK founder Robert Kilgour, an investor and former care home operator, said: “Scottish businesses and the economy has gone through an extended period of uncertainty and that is destabilising our opportunity to grow and crucially to secure inward investment.“The negative impact of the continuing uncertainty is a message I hear regularly from investors who turn to other countries or regions in England, to give their investments a more stable base from which to grow.”Former Conservative MEP Struan Stevenson, the campaign group’s chief executive, added: “We are four years from the last referendum on independence for Scotland which was not supported, yet the spectre of a further referendum remains ever present. “We’re calling on the Scottish Government to abandon the demand for another referendum and focus more on reigniting the Scottish economy, so we once again become a credible investment opportunity, on a par with other parts of the UK.”            Scottish Labour’s Economy spokesperson Jackie Baillie MSP said: “This is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy. As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.“Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs. She should drop her plans for an unwanted second independence referendum and instead try and start fixing the mess she has made of the economy and our schools and hospitals.”An SNP spokesperson described the claims as “ludicrously over the top”.“They show just how rattled the Tories are – they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no ,” the spokesperson said.            “Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK’s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland – and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.”Meanwhile, Scotland’s minister in charge of Brexit negotiations has warned of the growing risk the UK will be forced into a “chaotic, blind Brexit”.Constitution Secretary Mike Russell accused Theresa May of “misleading” voters on the prospects for her Chequers plan, claiming EU leaders have already dismissed the UK government’s proposals.And he claimed politicians south of the Border had failed to meet their pledge that Scotland would be an “equal partner”  it stayed in the Union.Mr Russell said the Prime Minister must use a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg this week to “rule out both a ‘blind’ and a No-deal Brexit”.            Speaking ahead of an address to business leaders and academics in Edinburgh, Mr Russell said: “Four years ago today, the people of Scotland voted on our nation’s future and were then told we were to be treated as equal partners in the UK – absolutely nothing that has happened since has lived up to that pledge, with Brexit making it clearer by the day that Westminster is incapable of working in Scotland’s national interests.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may it s my brexit deal or no deal at all","story":"        Rejecting a Brexit agreement based on the government\u0027s Chequers plan will mean the UK crashed out of the EU without any deal at all, Theresa May has said in a warning to Brexiteers in her own party.                The Prime Minister said that unless Conservative MPs accept the outcome of her negotiations with Brussels, \"the alternative to that will be having no deal\".            Her comments in a BBC Panorama interview came as Boris Johnson mounted another attack on Mrs May\u0027s strategy, claiming that the issue of the Irish border is being used to turn the UK into a \u0027vassal state\u0027 and that talks will end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".            : These are the ‘most Googled’ questions about BrexitMr Johnson said the European Union\u0027s fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was \"annexed\" by Brussels.Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he added.However the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\" and put the Union at risk.Reports suggest that the EU is preparing to accept use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure in Ireland and checks on goods being shipped between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Brussels\u0027 current proposal is to effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union until a comprehensive trade deal with the UK is agreed, something that the DUP and political parties in Scotland have rejected.            Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.\"\"If we are to get out of this mess, and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop, and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels,\" he added.\"The EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\", Mr Johnson said.            \"Both versions of the backstop are disastrous,\" he wrote. \"One threatens the union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules takers.\"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.\"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name.\"Mrs May said there needs to be \"friction-free\" movement of goods across the Irish border, without customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU, after Brexit.She said that the counter-proposal will not \"solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Ireland\".            \"The people of Northern Ireland deserve to be listened to in these negotiations by the UK Government, as do people elsewhere in this country,\" she told the BBC.\"I want to ensure that as we go forward we have that strong union...

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nTuesday 18 Sep 2018 2:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government.

So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza .

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

It’s always good craic, but our Cadets also put in some serious work, learning something new every week and stretching themselves with training that can lead to respected accreditations.  Acquiring those new skills – whether that’s a BTEC in Public Services or how to abseil off a clf – creates a real sense of achievement.  Importantly, it also gives our Cadets something signicant to put on their Personal Statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs and everyone comes away feeling positive about themselves.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“No-one can be good at everything, but we believe that everyone can be good at something and our hugely committed Adult Instructors make sure that every one of the Cadets under their care has the encouragement and opportunity to shine.”\n\nTeens from Cadet Detachments across County Antrim are already getting behind the membership campaign, preparing to welcome newcomers. \n\nCadet Sergeant Yasmin Andrews, who currently serves as her Majesty’s Lord Lieutenant’s Cadet for the County of Antrim, says, “We all know how much you can get out of being a Cadet, but we also know that it can be awkward to walk into somewhere new, knowing no-one.  Hopefully anyone coming along to check out our Detachment will see how friendly we all are and will feel welcome. … it’s up to us to persuade them to give Cadets a try!\n\n“We get to do the sort of outdoor stuff that can cost a fortune  you try to go it alone - mountain biking, climbing, marksmanship, abseiling and kayaking, plus we can do the Duke of Edinburgh Awards, work towards BTECs and we get the chance to go on Camp every year. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDromore Cadet Daniel Hooke agrees.  He says, “There’s so much happening that there really is something for everyone.  Most people find something they really enjoy and do well at but, even  you aren’t great at a particular activity, it’s always good craic having a go!”\n\nColonel McCammond adds, “Parents naturally want to give their children as many opportunities as possible but there have to be limits to withdrawals from the Bank of Mum \u0026amp Dad!  A key benefit of the cadet movement therefore is that all our activities are affordable or, even better, totally free … even the unorms are free all kids pay for is their footwear.\n\n“Cadet membership is open to boys and girls from age 12 to 18 and, right now, local Detachments are encouraging potential new members to come along and see for themselves what the Cadet movement has to offer. The earlier you join the more time you have to fit in all the experiences, but people shouldn’t be put off by the idea that they’ve maybe left it too late.

Certainly, for most people, there will be a Detachment within easy reach, and we are hoping that we’ll see plenty of potential new members coming along to check us out, without any obligation to make a commitment. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Mums and dads are welcome to come along too, to see what the kids are getting involved with … and we’re hopeful that we may even be able to persuade some intrepid parents to consider working with us as Adult Volunteers!

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"celebrating irish language","story":"\n\nNOMINATIONS\n are still open for The Outstanding Contribution to the Irish Language Award in this year’s Aisling Awards.\n\nThis award celebrates the vibrancy and uniqueness which the Irish language brings to the city of Belfast, the award will honour an organisation or person who works tirelessly to pioneer the language.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present.

Only ministers can decide what are the best strategies and policies to make a dference, only ministers can set priorities for action, and only ministers can choose how best to allocate the scarce resources, especially financial resources, available to us.\n\n“So, we need our executive back quickly to give us the direction we need to make Northern Ireland a better place to live and work for all our citizens.\n\n“This is even more pressing following a Court of Appeal judgment at the start of July which has further reduced the scope for decision-making by civil servants.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDavid Sterling said it was vital that civil servants’ impartiality was protected \n\n\n\n\nMr Sterling added: “The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, recently announced her intention to take forward legislation through Westminster to give greater clarity and certainty to decisions takes by the Northern Ireland Civil Service.\n\n“We welcome greater clarity about our role, but I want to be very clear on this – we can never be a substitute for democratically elected and accountable ministers.\n\n“Great care will need to be taken so that any new arrangements which may be put in place, no matter how temporary, do not compromise the impartiality of the civil service.\n\n“We cannot afford to have our integrity called into question when we are called to serve a new executive.”\n\nIreland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney, met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, in Dublin on Monday to discuss the lack of a ing executive in Stormont.\n\nSpeaking after the meeting, Mr Coveney said: “I was glad to meet with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP, as both Governments continue to work together as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, to address the ongoing absence of the powersharing Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland.\n\n“I reiterated to Secretary of State Bradley the Government’s deep concern at the continuing impasse with the devolved institutions, which she shares.\n\n“We reaffirmed the strong determination of both Governments to get the devolved institutions up and running again and we discussed how that can now be most effectively advanced.\n\n“I am hopeful that in the period ahead it will be possible to commence a political process to get beyond the current impasse and seek an agreement between the parties on operating the devolved\ninstitutions again, consistent with the full and effective implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n“I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving that, but I firmly believe that a resolution is possible and that the calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for\nthe devolved institutions to operate will be heeded.”\n\n\nThe final engagement of the day for Secretary of State was meeting Tanaiste

Iveagh House in Dublin.\n\n“Today the Tanaiste and I discussed the shared priority of the United Kingdom and Ireland’s Governments to see the rapid restoration of a fully ing Executive in Northern Ireland.\n\n“To work towards that we intend to work more intensively to establish a basis for moving into more formal political dialogue, in accordance with the three stranded approach.”\n\nMs Bradley added she was considering external facilitation to help move powersharing talks to the next stage.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"exubs trader given temporary stay of his deportation","story":"\n Hi

Sending a 38-year-old man to a country where he has not lived since the age of four was always madness, given that he has lived in Britain since the age of 12 and the UK is where his friends and partner live and where his family le is based. It is – unquestionably – his home.\n\n“Kweku Adoboli may have been born elsewhere, but he is more British, with more loyalty to Britain than many people with a passport – even though that loyalty has been severely tested by the Home Office and its hostile environment.”\n\nIt was feared that Mr Adoboli, who was released after serving half his sentence, had been due to be deported on Tuesday evening.\n\nNow it is hoped he will be allowed home to his Scottish “family” and partner Alice within the next five to 10 days.\n\nHis lawyers had argued that Mr Adoboli had been teaching at several universities and working with an initiative promoting responsible leadership since his release from prison in June 2015.\n\nThey also noted he left Ghana at the age of four, has lived in the UK since the age of 12 and it is where his family is based.\n\nA group of 132 MPs and MSPs have written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid urging him to intervene.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nKweku Adoboli has lived in Britain since the age of 12 \n\n\n\n\nThe decision to deport Mr Adoboli had been upheld at several stages by the courts.\n\nMr Adoboli was detained during a fortnightly check-in at Livingston Police Station, West Lothian, on September 3 and taken to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in South Lanarkshire.\n\nIn her letter Ms Nokes wrote: “Financial crime, like all crime, has an impact on the society that we live in and the public expects robust action to be taken against foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crime.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lib dem leader sir vince cable to call for brexit uturn in keynote address","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Then my sophomore year of high school I took another class and really fell in love with it. \n\n“It was an assignment from my art teacher and we had to choose something to draw that reflected something social. I chose friendship and just being nice to people. I also guess I wanted to challenge myself because I knew that I was terrible at drawing hands.\n\n“Honestly I just got bored of writing the same words over and over again. I wanted to spice up my le. I thought it would be really funny  someone was just looking at it trying to read the words and then just read ‘butthole’. \n\n“I was giggling so much when I was finishing the piece.

Obviously I was super excited it was like my 10 minutes of fame. It felt great. \n\n“I also was surprised that other people found it funny.

He told reporters at the White House: “If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay.”\n\nIf the Judiciary committee’s timetable slips, it would become increasingly dficult for Republicans to schedule a vote before the November 6 elections.\n\nWith fragile Republican majorities of just 12-11 on the Judiciary committee and 51-49 in the full Senate, Republican leaders had little room for defectors without risking a humiliating defeat of Mr Trump’s nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nAmong the Republican defectors was Senator Jeff Flake, a Judiciary Committee member who has clashed bitterly with Mr Trump and is retiring from the Senate. \n\nMr Flake said he told number two Senate Republican leader John Cornyn on Sunday that “ we didn’t give her a chance to be heard, then I would vote no”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \n\n\n\n\nThere was enormous pressure on Republican Sensators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, two moderates who have yet to announce their positions on Mr Kavanaugh and are not on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nMs Collins said both Mr Kavanaugh and Ms Ford should testy under oath to the committee. Neither she nor Ms Murkowski face re-election this autumn.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, another retiring Trump critic who is not on the committee, also said he favoured delaying Thursday’s panel meeting.\n\nSome Democrats raised questions about whether Mr Grassley’s plan was sufficient.\n\n\nI agree with Senator Flake that we should delay this week\u0027s vote on Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination. There\u0027s a lot of information we don\u0027t know and the FBI should have the time it needs to review this new material. Staff calls aren\u0027t the appropriate way to handle this.\n— Sen Dianne Feinstein  \nSeptember 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein of Calornia, the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, told reporters that “there needs to be some investigation first, and I’m not that sure this allows for that”. \n\nAnother Democrat on the panel, Senator Richard Blumenthal said staging the hearing without the FBI investigation would make it a “sham”.\n\nUnderscoring the raw political isions prompted by the Kavanaugh fight, Ms Feinstein said she had only learned of the hearing on Twitter.\n\nEarlier, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said it would be “a deep insult to the women of America”  Mr Grassley did not postpone Thursday’s meeting. \n\nMr Kavanaugh and Ms Ford had each indicated earlier on Monday a willingness to testy to the Judiciary committee. \n\nDebra S Katz, Ms Ford’s lawyer, said on NBC’s Today show that Ms Ford was ready to testy publicly to the Judiciary panel, but she did not respond on Monday evening to efforts to learn whether she would appear.\n\nMr Kavanaugh, 53, whose confirmation had seemed to be on a smooth trajectory, went to the White House on Monday. \n\nMr Trump said he did not meet with his nominee and declined to say whether Mr Kavanaugh had offered to withdraw, dismissing the question as “ridiculous”.\n\nMs Ford, now a psychology professor at Calornia’s Palo Alto University, told The Washington Post that an intoxicated Mr Kavanaugh corralled her into a bedroom at a Maryland party when she was around 15 and Mr Kavanaugh was about 17, held her down on a bed, tried to undress her and held his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. \n\nShe said she got away when a companion of Mr Kavanaugh’s jumped on him.\n\nMr Kavanaugh said in a statement distributed by the White House on Monday that he wanted to “refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"82 objections lodged plans new wind turbines","story":"\nAn application for two new wind turbines on the outskirts of Derry has been refused over concerns that the local area is shouldering the ‘bulk’ of responsibility in terms of renewable energy.\n\nThe application was for the construction of two turbines at the existing Monnaboy Wind farm, which currently contains four wind turbines after planning permission was granted on October 4, 2012.\n\nThe location of Monnaboy Wind Farm is on land located east of 62 Monnaboy Road in Greysteel and the applicant is Gaelectric Developments Ltd.\n\nAn application was previously deferred for reconsideration following severe flooding in the Eglinton area event in August 2017.\n\nIt came before a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee earlier this year, where voted not to accept the recommendation to approve the application due to fears over the impact it would have on the character of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe application was discussed again at the September meeting of the Planning Committee, held in the Guildhall, which was told that 82 letters of objection had been submitted in relation to the proposal. \n\nSome of the main areas of concern are, public health implications, the impact on wildle, natural habitats, landscape quality and heritage sites.\n\nAt the meeting, an objector was given the opportunity to address the committee, telling the councillors that the current turbines are already ‘overbearing’ and there is ‘constant noise’ which would ‘increase’  two turbines were added.\n\n\n\n

‘constant flickering of lights’ which has forced residents to grow hedges higher to ‘reduce noise’ and the ‘visual impact’.\n\nIn her view, the wind turbines were ‘eroding the character’ of the area and she believed residents should have the same rights as other ‘country dwellers’.\n\nThe turbines were not required to meet any renewable energy targets, she added, and the Derry City and Strabane District Council area was ‘carrying the full burden’ in comparison to neighbouring council areas.\n\nCommenting, Sinn Féin councillor Kieran McGuire said Derry City and Strabane District Council has been carrying the ‘bulk’ of responsibility in terms of meeting targets when other council areas are ‘not doing anything’.\n\nHe proposed refusing the application which was seconded by his party colleague Christopher Jackson.\n\nAnother Sinn Féin Councillor, Dan Kelly, also said the figures were ‘alarming’ and that this council area was ‘leading the way’.\n\nHe believed that  the council had been performing poorly it would’ve been ‘splashed over the front page of papers’.\n\nThe proposal to refuse the application was supported by the majority of councillors.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bishop derry announces number clerical changes derry diocese","story":"\nThe Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown has announced a number of changes in the Derry

have seen the owners of a restaurant in the city centre banned from erecting a shelter at the front of the premises.\n\nThe application came before the September meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee seeking approval for the installation of three external retractable awnings to part of the front façade of the Custom House building at Custom House Street in Derry, pictured above.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, a planning officer said that advice had been received from the Historic Environment Division  that the installation would have an ‘adverse affect’ on a number of listed buildings within the area, including Custom House, the Harbour Commissioners Office, Harbour Square and The Guildhall.\n\nThe meeting was told that the HED were of the opinion that the proposal would result in ‘unnecessary damage’ to the historic structure. \n\nThe officer added that while the plans before them had been amended from a previous application, the awnings would still ‘obscure the windows to a certain extent and remain inappropriate on a building of this style and character’.\n\nThe meeting head that a precedent had been set by the nearby Guildhall Taphouse bar, formerly the Monico Bar, another listed building which mow has an awning over a seated area.\n\nHowever, the Historic Environment Division said the building was ‘of a dferent style’.\n\nThe planning officer advised local councillors refuse the application on grounds that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’ as it would have an adverse effect on the character of Custom House and the setting of the surrounding listed buildings.\n\nThe meeting then heard from a representative of the applicant, Kular Fashions, who said that the contractor chosen to carry out the work are the ‘best in the UK’ and would carry out the work in a ‘delicate’ manner which would have ‘no impact on the structure itself’.\n\nHe added that the awning would bring ‘le and people’ into the space and said buildings are ‘not antiques’ and should be ‘inhabitable’ whether it is sunny or raining.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot =

applicant also assured councillors that the awning would not contain any advertising.\n\nDUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said there are a ‘strong trio’ of buildings in the area and she didn’t want to interfere with their architectural integrity.\n\nCouncillor Dan Kelly, of Sinn Féin, said the awnings would provide shelter for street entertainment and believed that tables on the streets was part of the ‘direction of travel’ in the city. \n\nHead of Planning with council, Maura Fox, said it is a ‘balancing act’ and she was ‘very much in favour of retaining listed buildings’. \n\nSDLP councillor Tina Gardiner said she would be supportive of the awning  it was ‘tasteful’ and made reference to their widespread use on historic buildings in London. \n\nUsing the Guildhall Taphouse as an example, she said it made the space visible and attracts ‘le and vitality’.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin Cllr Patricia Logue said, the buildings may become ‘vacant and derelict’, but agreed that they should contain ‘no advertising’. \n\nHowever, the SDLP’s Gus Hastings believed awnings didn’t serve much purpose and would only encourage ‘outside smoking’ and therefore wouldn’t be supporting it.\n\nEleven councillors voted in favour of the awnings and two against, meaning the advice of planning officers was ‘overturned’.\n\nThe meeting was told that the matter would come back before the council next month.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"plans new museum derry building used local irish republican group","story":"\nA building in Derry’s city centre which is used by an Irish republican group is set to

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

not have either had something in the pipeline or attempted to at least spend some of the money on EU Exit.

man whose father was shot and killed by the IRA in Dublin in the 1980s has said Sinn Fein\u0026#8217s candidate for the Irish presidential election is \u0026#8220completely unsuitable\u0026#8221 over comments she made about terrorism.\n\n                \nSinn Fein confirmed at the weekend the selection of Liadh Ní Riada as their candidate to contest the election.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAustin Stack, whose father Brian was a chief prison officer in Portlaoise when he was shot by the IRA in 1983 and died 18 months later from his injuries, said Ms Ní Riada’s comments in an interview with Hot Press magazine regarding terrorism made her unsuitable as president of Ireland.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn the interview, Ms Ní Riada said she was happy to denounce the actions of Islamic State as terrorism, but said that  the word was used as a “blanket term” for every conflict situation then it would wrongly condemn the IRA.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMs Ní Riada said she would use the word to refer to the Islamic State grouping because there are “dferent levels of terrorism”. However, she added: “I don’t really like the word terrorism. You have to look at every conflict on its own right.”\n\nMr Stack, speaking to the News Letter, said: “She said she wouldn’t consider acts carried out by the IRA during the Troubles as acts of terrorism. She said they should be seen in the contect of the ‘conflict’ at the time.\n\n“I would have an issue with that. My dad was shot down in cold blood while walking down a street in Dublin. A man came up and shot him in the back of the head. My dad wasn’t involved in any conflict. From my perspective, to try and dress that up in the context of some conflict is not tenable. It is not accurate. It’s trying to rewrite history. It’s trying to gloss over acts of terrorism.”\n\nHe continued: “It is hurtful and it is offensive. These people in Sinn Fein keep coming with this stuff. It worries me that  these people keep saying this often enough, people will believe it.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA spokesperson for Sinn Fein said: “Liadh Ní Riadh has said she wants to be a new president for a new Ireland. \n\n“A process of national reconciliation is central to uniting the people of Ireland. If elected, reconciliation will be a theme of her presidency.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n
