They had taken their battle all the way to the Supreme Court.Knowing it was soon to become a legal possibility, our interest was piqued. Like Steinfeld and Keidan, we love and are committed to each other, but didn’t want to get married.         Hilary, who has been married once before, said the partnership is simpler, cleaner and more honest. She claimed: \u0027Weddings have become such overblown exercises in consumerism — all about the party, not the relationship\u0027We had our personal reasons: Mickael has never seen the point of marriage. His parents were orced, and his mother has lived with his stepfather for 30 years. I have been married before — a big wedding at the London Palladium in 1998 — and went through a long and tortuous orce 13 years later, which, I’ll admit, has made me cynical about the whole institution.Also, I didn’t want Mickael to become my ‘second husband’, an expression that makes it sound as if he’s the runner-up, less somehow than the first. I also wished to to differentiate this relationship from my marriage, as something distinct.So we chose a civil partnership, as a way to formalise our relationship without all the baggage and ritual that comes with a wedding.          Her mother\u0027s name and occupation would appear on the certificate unlike a traditional marriage certificate which only shows the father\u0027s. This \u0027antiquated nugget of sexism\u0027 is  separates the two types of ceremony and makes Hilary view civil partnerships even more favourably A civil partnership seemed simpler, cleaner, more honest, not to mention cheaper (the whole thing has cost us £225). Weddings have become such overblown exercises in consumerism — all about the party, not the relationship. We also wanted our guests to be there without having to worry about buying a new outfit, or a gift.Civil partnerships have no religious associations, which suits atheist me and secular Mickael, and no patriarchal ones. There was no expectation that I would take Mickael’s surname, or that anyone would ‘give me away’ — a ridiculously outdated notion, especially as I’m 48 years old and haven’t lived in my parents’ home for 30 years.Also, my mother’s name and occupation would appear on the certificate, not just my dad’s: an antiquated nugget of sexism still attached to the traditional marriage certificate, which should have been changed years ago.         Mikael (pictured signing the agreement) \u0027didn\u0027t see the point to marriage\u0027 and present Hilary with a ring on Christmas Eve last year. She has agreed to wear it on the third finger of my left hand, which is said to connect with the heartWe registered our interest in a civil partnership ceremony with Camden Council and less than an hour later, I received an unexpected phone call from a chirpy registrar.‘How would you like to be one of the first and do it on New Year’s Eve?’ she asked. ‘Assuming, that is, that the law goes through the House of Lords in time.’Surprised, I replied: ‘Why not?’ The law did go through and so, on December 2, we were invited to give our notice — the required 29 days before the ceremony, so the news of our impending non-nuptials could be inscribed on a board.I’m told that seven other couples held their ceremonies in Camden yesterday, with a further 12 booked in so far. But the Government estimates there could be as many as 84,000 ceremonies countrywide in 2020 — which sounds a lot until you realise it’s only a tiny fraction of the 3.3 million cohabiting couples in the UK.Still, I managed to feel sentimental about our special day.Mickael and I met nine years ago in Nice, in the South of France, and have lived together in London for almost six years.While many people see getting married as a new chapter, an adventure, neither Mickael nor I felt the need to transform our relationship. We’re happy as we are. For us, having a civil partnership meant cementing what we already had, formalising it, not changing it into something new.         The Government estimates there could be as many as 84,000 ceremonies countrywide in 2020 — which sounds a lot until you realise it’s only a tiny fraction of the 3.3 million cohabiting couples in the UKUltimately, though, we decided to have a civil partnership because we felt we didn’t really have a choice. Marriage may be going out of fashion, with half as many couples tying the knot as 80 years ago, but, contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as common-law marriage. That means cohabiting couples have no rights in the UK.Had we split up, or had one of us died, we would have been faced with a legal and administrative nightmare, with no automatic rights to inheritance or bereavement benefits or pensions, and no tax relief. We felt we had to protect our little family.Trying to explain the concept to our daughter, Sidonie, was tricky, though. Four-year-olds have conservative views, so she naturally assumed that, as her parents, we were married already. And, not having been to a real-life wedding, she can only imagine them as a fairytale, with a prince marrying a princess in a castle, after he’s fitted her with a glass slipper.So the idea of getting on the bus to go to a council building didn’t quite compute.‘It’s like a wedding but it’s not a wedding,’ I offered. The ‘not-a-wedding’ bit stuck and she started talking about it over the following days. ‘I can wear this to your not-a-wedding, can’t I, Mummy?’ she would say. And, ‘Are Grandma and Grandad coming to your not-a-wedding?’Although we chose, mainly for Sidonie’s sake, to have a no-frills ceremony with vows to be ‘loving and faithful’ and traditional ‘I wills’ (you can have a standard ceremony based on a civil marriage, or write your own), it wasn’t necessary.While a marriage is solemnised by saying legally prescribed words, for a civil partnership you merely have to sign a legal document in front of two witnesses — which is, frankly, about as romantic as making a will. We didn’t need a ring, either, but I’m not one to turn down a gift of jewellery, and it felt right. The ring I picked, gold with three intertwined circles, is both simple and quirky, a symbolic of our union. It’s not an engagement ring or a wedding ring, but I have agreed to wear it on the third finger of my left hand, which is said to connect with the heart.         The bride enjoyed the fact there was no expectation that she would take Mickael’s surname, or that anyone would give her away, a notion which she dubs \u0027outdated\u0027, as she said she has lived at her parents\u0027 home for 30 yearsUnexpectedly, Mickael got down on one knee to present it to me on Christmas Eve 2018, in France, in front of his family. I must confess, the romance of his gesture made me happier than I would have anticipated.Never fond of convention — even at my actual wedding ceremony, in 1998, I opted for a red velvet beaded dress rather than a bridal white one — I found choosing what to wear for our ceremony quite difficult. Furthermore, just a week after Christmas, I was still the shape of a mince pie.         The couple, happily married with a four-year-old daughter, said some people still cannot grasp what a civil partnership entailsUsually I’ll find any excuse to buy a new frock but I didn’t want to get too dressed up, especially as I’d made it clear to our guests that this wasn’t a formal occasion. On the other hand, wearing jeans and a jumper or something equally casual felt wrong, as if I was making a mockery of the event. In the end I chose a long printed dress, a favourite I’ve had for years.People’s reactions to our decision have ranged from delighted to bewildered to outright critical of us for being awkward or contrary. Some have treated it just like a wedding and heartily congratulated us, while others haven’t known what to say or even asked why on earth we’ve done it, as if it’s some sort of affront.When people say ‘I hope you’ll be very happy together’, I have to answer: ‘We already are. It won’t change anything.’Very few people seem to grasp what it entails, or how it differs from marriage. To be fair, there isn’t much difference. Originally designed in 2004 for gay couples, who weren’t legally allowed to wed for another decade, civil partnership grants the same rights.One distinction is that you can’t annul a civil partnership on grounds of non-consummation, or because one partner has a venereal disease — which, to be honest, I didn’t realise was grounds (I guess people don’t admit to it nowdays, thank goodness).         Mickael and Hilary met nine years ago in Nice, in the South of France, and have lived together in London for almost six years. The 48-year-old mother said she picked a simple gold ring with , three intertwined circles as it was \u0027both simple and quirky, a symbolic of our union\u0027The other difference is that you can’t use adultery as a reason for dissolving a civil partnership, and it’s called a dissolution order rather than a orce.Otherwise, ending a civil partnership follows the same legal processes and procedures as orce, requiring a period of legal separation or the establishment of the breakdown of the relationship, with reasons, and is just as beset by difficulties and problems. And although I very much hope I never have to use it, it’s a real shame that the orce law wasn’t reformed before civil partnerships came into being.The Office for National Statistics figures suggest gay civil partnerships are less likely to be dissolved than marriages, perhaps because couples who choose to have them have already been together for a long time. Nobody yet knows if the same will be true for mixed- sex civil partnerships.Since same-sex marriage became legal in the UK in 2014, there has been a significant reduction in the number of civil partnerships, with gay couples now preferring to marry instead. It is conceivable, therefore, that in the future, civil partnership will become something mainly chosen by opposite-sex couples.         They merely had to sign a legal document in front of two witnesses on their special dayCertainly, the semantics around civil partnerships need some fine tuning. What do you call it? Getting ‘civilly partnered’ is a mouthful and sounds as if you’re going into business with your love, not committing yourself and all your worldly goods to them.At our notice-giving appointment, even the registrar kept getting it wrong and saying ‘When you get married’.As for what to call Mickael, I joke that he is my ‘sometimes civil partner’ I wish there was a better word. Perhaps I’ll have to invent one.And he’ll now have to stop calling me his girlfriend, or ‘ma copine’ as they say in France. But I do like the fact that he isn’t my ‘husband’ and I’m not his ‘wife’, there is no differentiation in our roles just because of our genders.We are both each other’s partner, the same and absolutely equal. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44fab705c97b4d4a19112a38e3434527c3183869/0_203_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=819666fabd9f1523aaeffe207d758e7a","title":"how we saw america guardian us photographs 2019","story":"The photographers  US worked with treated each story with care and creativity, making images that provide a stunning view of the past year2019 saw  US pass through some extraordinary territory.

It is either a first-time novelist going straight to No 1 (Gail Honeyman with Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine last year, EL James with all her Fifty Shades trilogy in 2012), or a former mega-seller returning with a new take on their old saga (James’s reverse-angle Grey in 2015, JK Rowling and her co-writers’ script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in 2016).This happened again in 2019, but with a double twist: a non-fiction title with two debut authors. Pinch of Nom by Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson, a pair of weight-watching food bloggers from the Wirral, was always a favourite for supremacy after it broke records in March for first-week sales. The spin-off Food Planner also makes the top 50, and the pair are bound to get a third title well up the chart by the end of the year as their follow-up, Pinch of Nom: Everyday Light, came out on 12 December.Their success reflects a reconfiguration of the domestic sector, with a falling away of celebrity chefs’ recipe books (Jamie Oliver’s Veg is the sole survivor at No 9) and the rise of offerings centred on weight loss or fitness, including Michael Mosley’s The Fast 800 (23) and titles just outside the chart by Joe Wicks and Tom Kerridge. Books about housework or home organisation are on the rise too, as shown by the remarkable sales for two books (5, 17) by Mrs Hinch – Sophie Hinchcliffe – promising to “shine your sink and soothe your soul”. Published a fortnight apart in the spring, Pinch of Nom and Hinch Yourself Happy both owe much to their authors’ social media presence – Mrs Hinch has an eye-popping 2.9 million followers on Instagram.Also mingling in the chart’s elite with the usual suspects – Oliver, David Walliams, Lee Child, Jeff Kinney – are representatives of another trend, the insider memoirs of people in stressful jobs: Adam Kay (6, 15) and Christie Watson (47) on hospital medicine, the Secret Barrister (25) on the law, Ant Middleton (19) on the army, and Peter Crouch (on the chart’s subs’ bench at 62) on football. Tellingly, the most popular examples of “job lit” outsold the top new celebrity memoirs – Elton John’s Me (38), Billy Connolly’s Tall Tales (43) – in a defeat of the famous by the non-famous that mirrors Pinch of Nom’s triumph in cookbooks.The heftier, more scholarly end of the factual spectrum, by contrast, continued to flounder commercially. If Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens (50) – one of only two translated works in the list – were not still hanging on five years after publication, Bill Bryson’s The Body (39) would be the lone standard bearer for the kind of non-fiction that wins prizes.In fiction, meanwhile, a peculiar ision is discernible in the top 50, whereby all the chart’s crime novels are by men – an indication of the waning of the largely female-driven psychological thriller – and, perhaps more surprisingly, children’s fiction (from Philip Pullman to Walliams’s five titles to picture books) is a male preserve too. Conversely, no books classified as “general and literary fiction” are written by men, and the range of work by women is striking: Heather Morris’s hugely popular historical novel (2), more BDSM sex from James (31), smart commercial fiction by Liane Moriarty, Jojo Moyes and Sophie Kinsella (7, 10, 40), Eleanor Oliphant still doing more than fine in paperback (14), and the award-winning literary novelists Sally Rooney, Kate Atkinson and Madeline Miller (13, 41, 49).Plus, of course, the joint 2019 Booker winner Margaret Atwood, who scored with both the TV tie-in edition of The Handmaid’s Tale (37) and its victorious sequel. The Testaments (12) is the highest placed (adult) novel published this year and has quite possibly racked up the biggest sales ever by a winner in hardback, with 272,251 copies sold so far.Among other reasons to be cheerful are the performances of writers who, like the chart-topping double act, were little known a year ago. These include self-styled “grubby artist” Charlie Mackesy, whose sleeper hit The Boy, The Mole, the Fox and the Horse (20) took the Waterstones prize, memoirist Raynor Winn (35) and Greta Thunberg (32). Six years after Malala Yousafzai’s I Am Malala, the Swedish teenager matched her in producing a bestseller as well as in addressing the UN."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa25318001af8a223449dffb9345e4de67b4df4/0_107_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17845e7f27ef83a6ca16ecd0c9519a1b","title":"universal music sells stake to chinese giant tencent","story":"Vivendi said Tencent Music Entertainment, Tencent’s streaming subsidiary, which is listed on the New York stock exchange, will also buy a minority stake in Universal Music’s operation across China.“Vivendi is very happy with the arrival of Tencent and its co-investors,” Vivendi said in a statement. “They will enable UMG to further develop in the Asian market.”Vivendi and Tencent would not name other members of the consortium other than to say it included “certain global financial investors”.Separately, Vivendi said it had entered new talks just before Christmas over the potential sale of an additional minority stake in UMG, at a price “which would at least be identical” to the deal with Tencent, with another unnamed investor or investors.Following the announcement Sir Lucian Grainge, the chairman and chief executive of UMG, emailed staff to reassure them that the deal would not result in Tencent exerting any influence over the day-to-day running of the music company.“With the exception of additional resources to further advance our strategy, everything else will remain the same: our strategic vision our company, label and business unit names our locations and of course, our outstanding people,” he said. “This is an exciting development reflecting a strong validation of our business strategy, our incredible team and your excellent work.”The French media conglomerate has been angling to sell a stake in UMG for the last 18 months to cash in on the music industry revival which is being driven by the streaming revolution, in turn led by services including Apple, Spotify, Amazon and Deezer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77bf4875628d5fb6e6468e457b1e43f57d480d0f/0_189_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b08828b5ca077951efda3959255742","title":"new years eve day times square new york","story":"New Year’s Day, I will wake up refreshed. And while you’re passed out hungover, I will steal the money from your pocketsRejoice, for we are approaching a joyous and special time: New Year’s Eve, the day that offers you the very best chance of passing out drunkenly and freezing to death in a snowdrift.The best holiday is Christmas, or the appropriate cultural equivalent. It has fun traditions. It has lots of candy. And you get presents. Christmas is perhaps the only holiday that lives up to the weeks-long anticipatory buildup forced upon us by capitalism. Situated, as it is, at the end of the year, Christmas is a convenient time for us to reflect on what we have done in the past year, and contemplate what we wish to do next. Sitting cozily by the fire with a cup of hot chocolate and a pile of gifts, we absorb good cheer, making it more likely that we will decide to be nice to people in the year to come. I understand that some of you hate your families and therefore despise Christmas – but that’s a personal problem. You can’t blame Santa for that. If you were seeking to design the perfect holiday from scratch, Christmas checks all the boxes.Then, mere days later, as we’re still basking in the warm afterglow of generosity and peace, New Year’s Eve bursts in like a party guest who arrives after everyone else has left and demands that you turn up the music again. Also, they are throwing up on your floor. After the incredible buildup, release and cool-down of holiday spirit that begins after Thanksgiving and proceeds unabated until the end of the year, the last thing that any of us need is another damn holiday – much less a loud, intoxicated holiday interrupted often by screaming. We have one good holiday in December. That’s plenty. When it comes to holidays – and to proclamations like “I’m taking 20 shots for 2020, wooooo” – more is not always better.I live in New York City. It’s a lovely town, as long as you take care to avoid a few things: tourists, Times Square and large public gatherings, which are inevitably too crowded to be anything other than miserable. New Year’s Eve manages to combine these three terrors into a single event, and to throw in Kathy Griffin, mounted police and a million drunken people with nowhere to pee for good measure. You almost have to respect this abominable cocktail of doom, in the same way you might respect a jar full of every kind of poison on Earth. From a distance. It is not the sort of thing that you would invite people to.There is nothing wrong with marking the passage of a year with a quiet ceremony. Go out in the woods and say magic words as the clock strikes midnight, or stay in and whisper your new year’s resolution to your dog. Fine. Yet from coast to coast, the options offered to the public on the last day of the year are mostly bars, clubs and restaurants where prices have tripled. (The tripling of prices in turns triples the determination of patrons to act like monsters, in order to get their money’s worth.)Alternately, you can go to sleep early, insisting unconvincingly that you are not clinically depressed you can go to a friend’s party, which everyone will leave at 12:01 in order to go to another, more debauched party or, if you are a parent, you can stay home arguing with your kids about bedtime until midnight, when they will throw a temper tantrum upon finding out that they do not get presents. This particular holiday has the uncanny ability to make everyone, everywhere, of every age, more of an asshole. And we love it!Mostly, New Year’s Eve is about getting wasted. Because I do not drink, I find this a boring pretext for a national holiday. Some might say, “Of course you don’t like New Year’s Eve don’t turn your personal wretchedness into a pathetic pretense of principle, in an attempt to try to bring the rest of the world down to your level of misery.” Let’s not get sidetracked by these arguments. The point is: I’ll be celebrating at home, alone, with a nice glass of seltzer. You’re welcome to stop by. Or not. Go out and have your fun. See if I care.Tomorrow morning, I will wake up refreshed. And while you are passed out with a hangover, I will steal the money from your pockets. Happy new year. I hope this teaches you a valuable lesson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55fc29cacb4735f26cf83fe30c707d1e472b7f86/111_0_3280_1969/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c3ec70cebf7a207d2ae611f657f38ad","title":"as a refugee detained indefinitely by australia i wish you a happy new year","story":"I have been hoping the new year will fulfil my dreams and wishes for the past seven new yearsAnother new year approaches. A new year signifies new hope, new prospects, and new ideas for the future.Each new year people throughout the world hold infinite hope, wishes for a better life, a more fulfilling life.Some are lucky and their dreams, hope and wishes are fulfilled effortlessly. Some sadly lack the essential ingredients of success for whatever reason but for them, there are still other possibilities, other hopes, even if only small, that manage to fulfil them. As a refugee indefinitely detained and left in an uncertain limbo, as part of Australia’s offshore processing regime, I have been seeing and hoping the new year will fulfil my dreams and wishes for the past seven new years.But sadly, every year I am disappointed. Each year, my hopes and wishes remain unfulfilled. The unbearable disappointment leaves me weak and vulnerable. For the past six years the continual, agonising pain and sufferings as a refugee and asylum seeker has taken its toll.  We arrived in Australian waters seven years ago, fleeing torturous regimes, escaping on leaky boats for our lives. Yet we were filled with hope, we wanted a future, we had something to contribute to the world. Now we have lived through so many unforgettable experiences and memories whilst detained on Manus Island and Nauru by the Australian government.Memories such as the 2014 riots when the first innocent asylum seeker was lost to death, or the 2015 hunger strikes, the 2016 Good Friday shootings, or the 2017 siege in Lombrum camp where we were left without food or water for almost a month before finally being removed by force.  Memories such as the 2018 escalation of self-harm and suicide attempts, that sparked again after the Australian federal elections in 2019 when Morrison’s government was re-elected, how we are still left in limbo with life passing us by.As we languish for the past six years, 2019 passed us by with nothing but hopelessness and worries. Even the short-lived celebration of Medevac, came crushing to an end. Some of the refugees from Manus and Nauru have found their new lives in a safe country and are busy making their permanent homes. We wish them a very bright future ahead. But for those of us that remain, hope of a new future seems more remote than ever. But new year is a time of hope for new life. Even if impossible, while I live, I must believe in some hope – so I believe that 2020 will be the turning point for our freedom and our new start in life.Whilst every move of your politics determines my fate, nevertheless I wish all of you a very glorious and happy new year, one with your dreams and hopes fulfilled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52932a082185e067cd5b8e0a091b05fbbdae7e55/0_213_4731_2838/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06da061aa18b7a0f46ce18cd5bec1a38","title":"best photographs 2019 stories behind them","story":"From Notre Dame’s spire collapsing in flames to sled dogs wading through Greenland’s melted ice water and Stormzy triumphant at Glastonbury – photographers recall how they took some of the defining images of the year. Selected by features picture editor Sarah GilbertJacinda Ardern after the Christchurch shooting16 March The day after an Australian far-right extremist killed 51 people and injured another 49 during prayer at two mosques in Christchurch, prime minister Jacinda Ardern met Muslim community representatives at a primary school. As I waited outside, I saw her through a classroom window between reflections of trees and late summer flowers. With those people in grief, her clasped hands, the furrow in her brow, her facial expression, show empathy, concern, sadness, but most of all, love. In a way it summed up the way New Zealand reached out to its Muslim community during a horrific time. Three weeks later, parliament voted in legislation to restrict semi-automatic firearms and magazines by 119 votes to one.Climbers queueing at the summit of Mount Everest22 May I was trying to break one of my world records, the fastest summit of Everest and Lhotse – the record was 10 hours and I was trying to do it in six. I ended up waiting there for hours, so I took this photo as evidence that the queue stopped me from breaking the record. There need to be better rules and regulations for safer mountaineering. Presently there are no guidelines about how much experience you need, so after this I advised the Nepal government that people should have to demonstrate they can master at least an 8,000m mountain before attempting to climb Everest.Migrants rescued off the Malaga coast29 August I took this photo after an inflatable boat carrying 132 migrants was rescued by the Spanish coastguard in the Alboran Sea. They were waiting to disembark and were being cared for by members of the Red Cross. They came from the Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. Upon arrival they were transferred to the Spanish Refugee Aid Commission, then ended up going on to France. The reason they make the journey to Europe is complex, but it is often because of extreme poverty, exploitation and conflict in their countries of origin. You see in their faces, tiredness, despair and at the same time an expression of hope. Every time I photograph immigration, I feel sadness.Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump at Buckingham Palace3 June I was waiting in the garden of Buckingham Palace for the arrival of President Trump for the state visit. They were landing Marine One and other helicopters in the garden, so we were a long way away from the palace, and there was heightened security because of the likelihood of protests. Jared and Ivanka were looking out the window so they had a view of the whole garden and could watch the president arrive and review the guard of honour with the Queen. There was a symmetry about the way they were standing for some reason it reminds me of Grant Wood’s 1930 painting American Gothic.Rioters kiss in Santiago, Chile28 October I took this shot on the 10th day of the greatest social unrest Chile has seen, with people demanding dignity and equality when it comes to health, education, pay and free, safe and legal abortion, as well as many other issues. I had got into the habit of going down to the Plaza de la Dignidad in Santiago between 3pm and 4pm to see what was going on with the protesting. That day President Sebastián Piñera had called for calm, saying everything would go back to normal. That just made people even more furious. There were fires all around the plaza, including one just behind the masked couple standing outside the entrance to the metro station. I decided to take a picture. I think chaos is the best word to describe the atmosphere: there was smoke everywhere and the wind was whipping pieces of burnt paper into mini-tornadoes. There were sirens, flares, and all the noise from the fire engines and ambulances passing by. People were euphoric, and were chanting against the president and against repression. They were toppling lampposts and traffic lights to stop water cannon getting through and sheltering from rubber bullets behind bus stops. There was real rage in the air. People had lost their fear of protesting and felt it was time to say what they were thinking.Interview by Sam JonesA Rohingya boy shelters from the rain in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh21 August A few days before the second anniversary of what is now termed Genocide Day, Bangladesh announced its plan to repatriate 3,000 Rohingya to Myanmar. The mood in the camps was one of fear and panic, and some families were in hiding. The vast majority of the refugees refused to go back without their rights, citizenship and safety guaranteed. I heard that representatives from UNHCR were going door to door in the camp, talking to refugees about the plan and answering their questions. I hiked for more than an hour to reach the camp, and as soon as I tracked them down, the skies opened up and a downpour started. A group who had been talking with the UNHCR team took cover under the roof of a nearby tent. For a few moments, this boy leaned out into the rain, enjoying a brief respite from the summer heat, seemingly lost in his own world.7 March During a Greenpeace ship tour from Manila to Cebu, we did an underwater audit of plastic in the Verde Island Passage, the heart of global marine bioersity. On the first e day I was shooting near the surface when I found this crab stuck inside a cup. I felt mortified, but not as much as I should have. It’s so common now it’s no longer a surprise, which is telling of the gravity of the problem. For plastic waste, the Philippines is the third highest ocean polluter in the world. It sits in the centre of the Coral Triangle, meaning an abundance of marine life is in close and frequent contact with plastic debris – I often see diapers, plastic bags and plastic packaging underwater. I hope photos like this help people understand the extent of our impact on the natural world. It’s not simply a case of ditching plastic, but of changing our throwaway mentality.28 June I had seen Stormzy perform before at smaller venues, so I knew how talented he was. But this – Friday night on the Pyramid stage in front of an 80,000-strong crowd, the first black solo British artist and the first grime artist to ever headline Glastonbury, and at such a young age (25) – was such a historic moment that I felt nervous for him. Once he came running out on to the stage, he gave off this energy. The place erupted. I was completely blown away. He has since said he cried after the performance. About 20 minutes into the set he had issues with his earpiece and couldn’t hear himself, and he came off thinking he had completely blown it. But he was incredible. It was pretty special.9 June I was asked to cover street style at the LA Pride festival in West Hollywood, California, in a creative and fun way. Typically, street style is shot to just show off what the general fashion is, but I took a different approach and asked people for portraits so that I could get some emotion and personality to come out. I was very specific about who I asked for photos, but these two were an obvious choice. They completely embodied the spirit of this festival – it’s a place to be entirely yourself, have fun, and spend time with the people you love. They were unapologetically themselves and that is exactly what I was hoping to capture.Women worship in the polluted Yamuna River, India2 November Walking along the bank of the Yamuna early one morning, I saw these women praying in the river. It was the Hindu festival of Chhath Puja – the women fast for three days, then dip themselves in the water and pray to the sun god. So many people look at this photo and think it’s snow, but it’s actually the pollution from the river. The chemical waste from industrial and household pollution makes the froth. It’s a terrible irony that these women were praying while standing in water that could affect their health. There were even kids playing with the foam. That week, Delhi’s air pollution peaked to a three-year high. In India, the rivers are very important in our culture and praying in water is common. Pictures like this show how rivers like the Yamuna are now so polluted, it comes in the path of your faith as well as your health.The christening of Harry and Meghan’s sonChris Allerton for Sussex Royal via Getty Images8 May I was honoured to take the official photographs at the christening of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, and to once again be part of such a special and joyous occasion for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Greta Thunberg addresses the Montreal climate strike27 September When Greta Thunberg announced that she was going to be in Montreal for the climate strike march, we all knew this was going to be huge. In fact, with 500,000 protesters, it was the biggest demonstration in Canadian history. To get a true sense of the magnitude of the event, I convinced them to let me go on stage to take this photo. She was like a rock star. It was striking, the difference between her shyness offstage and her level of comfort in front of a crowd she climbed the stairs and went straight to the microphone, then turned towards the sun and cracked a little smile.26 October Many of the wedding vendors in Sonoma county had actually evacuated their families before driving to the venue. The nearest fires were about 25 miles away and by the end of the ceremony the sky had turned an orange-brown by sunset it was a brilliant red from the smoke. The happiest day of this couple’s lives was affected by climate change nobody is immune from it. So we decided to get a shot of them wearing the air-filter masks: I imagined them looking back at their wedding album in years to come. There was a lot of love in the air, but the fires were a huge part of their story and this photo is true to what it felt like to be there. After three years of wildfires, it made me stop and think: is this the new normal for California in the fall?Sled dogs in melted ice water, Greenland13 June I was in northwest Greenland to collect instruments that had been deployed on the sea ice in December, a trip I’ve done annually for the last eight years. This year the Arctic summer had come a few weeks early and it was 15-17C – extremely warm for June. In the fjord, we found ourselves in more water than we had ever seen on the ice in early June, which reflects what we know – the season for sea ice is getting shorter. The early melting of the ice cover led to water that was 20-40cm deep. Even the dogs – who have a hard life – were struggling. The local hunters, who we rely on for their traditional knowledge, were uncertain and found it extreme. We reached our limits and had to turn around. After 48 hours, more cracks had developed and drained most of the surface water away, so we were able to complete the assignment. I think that, symbolically, the photo shows the impact of climate change and how societies are challenged to plan and adapt for the future this way of life and culture may not exist in 50 years’ time.Phoebe Waller-Bridge after the Emmys23 September At the afterparty at Chateau Marmont in LA, hours after Phoebe had won a hatful of Emmys for Fleabag, we were sitting round the pool, away from the main party, when I captured an impromptu moment. I produced her first show (Crashing, for Channel 4), so I’ve seen first-hand how hard she has worked from the beginning. It has been a surreal joy watching Hollywood and the wider world discover her brilliance. She is an extraordinary soul and a multi-talented artist who deserves every accolade she has received. This was one of those nights you don’t forget and I’m thrilled that it resonated with so many. It’s not every day you take a candid picture of an old friend that the world embraces with such a fever.15 April I was having a beer after work when my boss called. There were reports of a small fire on the roof at Notre Dame. As I set off for the cathedral on my motorbike, I could see unusual yellow smoke from 2km away. It was soon clear it wasn’t a small fire. People were crowded around taking pictures, covering their mouths from the smoke with scarves, crying, praying. When the spire collapsed, people around me gasped. I remember people kneeling, praying and singing hymns – Ave Maria. I suppose you could say it could have been a lot worse we could have lost the towers and that would have been the end of Notre Dame. Later, we started to ask, why had this historic building not been properly protected? How could this happen in 2019?3 September I’ve covered many hurricanes but none with Dorian’s force. It was a monster that destroyed everything. It did not stop raining heavily and everything was flooded. When I arrived, there were volunteers with jet skis and small boats rescuing people. I asked if I could travel with them but the space was necessary for survivors. I decided to walk to the flooded area and that’s when I found these people – some of the volunteers who put their lives at stake to rescue their neighbours. They walked to a high area to get out of the water after working hard to get people out.7 July Women’s football gained so much more attention this year and has become so popular, with record viewing figures and stadiums selling out. Against the backdrop of suing for equal pay with the men’s game, the US team had such a strong run throughout the World Cup that everyone expected them to win. There is a very different atmosphere at women’s matches more of a family event. The sport has a different feel too. It’s more about the team and the sport itself than inidual players. I took this photo of Megan Rapinoe after Team USA had won and been presented with the trophy. She struck this iconic pose for the cameras. I could hear fans cheering for equal pay from the stands.Torrential rain at the Tour de Yorkshire2 May I’ve been photographing the Tour de Yorkshire since 2015 and this was the worst weather I had ever seen. It was the first stage and I was working off the back of a motorbike. After the breakaway came through, the other photographers left, but I waited for the peloton to come over the bridge. It just started absolutely chucking it down. I had never experienced rain like that in this country – I was completely soaked through and one of my lenses packed up. It was sheer luck that Nicholas Dlamini came out in front in white and they formed this perfect arrow shape. My screen was covered in rain, so I jumped back on the bike to get ahead of the peloton again, concentrating on keeping my cameras dry. It was only later, while I was trying to dry off, that I realised how nice it had turned out.Protester confronts an armed policeman in Hong Kong25 August The protests were in their third month when I took this photo. Violence had broken out after a peaceful march and many protesters carried umbrellas, a symbol of the resistance movement. Hong Kong police officers drew pistols on protesters who were charging them with sticks. One officer fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell. This unarmed protester in shorts and a tanktop approached one of them and dropped to his knees, saying: “Don’t shoot”. The officer didn’t shoot, but kicked the man, knocking him over. I got this shot a moment later, when he stood up and backed away, umbrella in hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a4dc3148c5d0ca8074a6f1c309c9b38e822ebd/0_478_6668_4002/master/6668.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b3beaa4abb6ff3f88f04c5bd6b882ce 1140w","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

For others, she is the woman once married to that famous Scientologist who declared his love for her by jumping up and down on Oprah’s sofa. But for followers of fashion, Holmes has become 2019’s answer to Celine Dion – with Monica from Friends a close second.But while Dion whooped and clapped her way to style icon status from the front row of couture shows in 2017, wearing flashy Balenciaga and Off-White outfits, Holmes’s ascent has been all together more low-key. Exhibit A: casually stepping out in a cashmere cardigan worn so louchely that the matching cashmere bra underneath, available from Khaite for $520, sold out in minutes – no small feat for a bra that costs more than the average monthly food shop for a family of four. Exhibit B: a chunky knit cardigan over a denim shirt with black leather trousers worn to a New York fashion show a high-fashion version of what her Dawson’s Creek character might have worn for a date with Pacey.Gypsophila might have had an autumnwinter moment, but it was the floral setting of the 10th anniversary show of French designer Jacquemus – labelled the kind of show “that Instagram was made for” – that had the hearts of the botanically inclined beating the fastest. Hosted in a field in Provence, the soporific fleur de choix was the perfect backdrop for the designer’s oversized blazers, bucket hats and bumbags.At Paris fashion week in March, the year’s least useful accessory was carried between thumb and forefinger down the Jacquemus catwalk, bright red yet barely visible. The Mini Le Chiquito, as it is known, became the patron saint of the nano bags trend – utterly useless, they couldn’t even fit your keys, and yet they became highly desirable, representing the ultimate power move. Who needs a massive tote when you have an assistant or car waiting?Nano bags are the younger sibling of this year’s trend for extremely specific bags. There was Balenciaga’s £600 water bottle bag, bags made to fit lipsticks and others perfectly tailored to fit phones. And the most stylish was part of Paco Rabanne’s retro chainmail collection.The nano bag’s place in 2019 fashion history was recently cemented when Lizzo pincered a Valentino version on the red carpet at the AMAs. As she put it on Instagram: “bag big enough for my fucks to give”.When the judge wore this arachnid accessory to announce that Boris Johnson’s prorogation of parliament was unlawful, people were quick to try to decode what message she might have been hoping to send. Was it that she had caught the democracy-dodging prime minister in a judicial web? Whatever was intended, the spider brooch, described by Vogue as “maximalist perfection”, became a breakout star. But Lady Hale wasn’t alone in sparking chatter with her brooch. The speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi wore a pin representing the Mace of the United States House of Representatives as she opened the debate about Trump’s impeachment. It was quickly dubbed her “power pin”.An honourable mention must also go to headbands. They might have less political heft than the brooch, but have almost as much historical weight as a Mantel novel, and made Anne Boleyn one of the year’s unlikely style inspirations.A sequinned Louis Vuitton hoodie on the carpet one day, an elephant-grey ensemble by Colombian-French designer Haider Ackermann the next the Call Me By Your Name actor is unafraid of the bold, conceptual and sartorially tricky. But that adventurousness has not put people off. His style has won him the moniker “the most influential man in fashion”, according to Lyst’s 2019 report, which analyses the behaviour of more than 104 million shoppers. He was pipped to the post of the “World’s Most Powerful Dresser” only by HRH the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle herself. Proof that the unorthodox can be enviable in the sometimes identikit world of men’s fashion. He even managed to make the world’s trickiest hairstyle, the bowl cut, an unlikely hit.It cost £40, was hailed as being as comfortable as a nightie and was as ubiquitous on the UK’s streets throughout the summer as chewing gum or pigeons. One article in the New York Times even claimed that the Zara dress had “conquered Britain”, so widespread was it. Plus, like the green Urban Outfitters puffer jacket and Réalisation Par leopard-print skirt before it, it had that most modern of popularity yardsticks: its own Instagram account complete with more than 20,000 followers.Porter’s own take on the Christian Siriano gown he wore to the Oscars in February rang true: “That dress changed the world,” he said. It was a two fingers up to the rigid gender diktats controlling red-carpet outfits – as Porter told Vogue at the time: “When you’re black and you’re gay, one’s masculinity is in question.

It was the look that wouldn’t give up the Laura Ashley ghost, having kicked off in 2018 with Brooklyn designer Batsheva Hay as its poster girl. In 2019 it went mass, and wearing a dress with a jaw-high neckline, tibia-long hemline and plentiful valance-style dust-ruffle-frills was a quick way to look as if you knew your way around the pages of Vogue – and Willa Cather’s novel O Pioneers!Not usually mentioned in the same breath as fashion industry buzz but the outer London home of traffic jams and self-storage depots became a hotspot this year when a collection by Louis Vuitton menswear designer and Kanye West protoge Virgil Abloh landed at the Wembley branch of Ikea.

As one queuer put it: “We are buying Louis Vuitton stuff for the price of Ikea.”When Melania Trump headed to the UK in June, she did so in an outfit that, in a cod Cockney accent, said: “London, baby”.

Email feast@theWhat’s the best way to prepare garlic: chop, crush or mince? And what about the little central shoot – should we discard that, as some chefs tell us to?Hilde, West SussexThe approach you choose depends more than you might think on what you’re cooking, and on the role you want the garlic to play in it. Put simply, that’s because the more you process garlic, the stronger it will be. I’ll spare Hilde too much by way of spoddy science speak, other than to say that, as culinary egghead Harold McGee points out in his epic On Food \u0026amp Cooking, when you cut into a bulb of garlic, it sets off a chemical reaction between two of the allium’s key components (allinase and cycteine, seeing as you asked), which in turn releases sulphur compounds. This means the less you damage the bulb, the less sulphur is released, which is why sliced or chopped garlic is nowhere near as potent, or indeed pungent, as crushed, and why whole bulbs stay so gloriously sweet after roasting.But does it really matter, and should we care? Alastair Little, who, with the likes of Rowley Leigh and Simon Hopkinson helped reinvent modern British cooking in the 1980s, isn’t so sure: “I’ve always chopped, pounded, minced, crushed and pressed garlic with no particular logic,” he admits cheerfully, “and to be honest, I’ve never differentiated between them, except when I want to avoid small chunks in a dish.”More recently, Little has become even more laid-back: “My current favourite method is just to grate the cloves, unpeeled, through a Microplane. You end up with finely minced garlic on one side, and the skin in your hand on the other.”Oddly, the new generation of chefs seem far less gung-ho. “It all depends on what you want from the garlic,” insists Alex Jackson, chefco-owner of Sardine in London, which majors in the food of southern France. “In Italian and French cuisine, it’s often included only as a background flavour, so my default is to slice it thinly lengthways.” This, he says, is what you’d use in Mediterranean soups, tomato sauces, soffrittos, etc: “It colours to an even golden brown when you fry it, then breaks down slowly, releasing a subtle taste that won’t overwhelm.”For dishes that require more of a punch, Jackson chops his garlic finely – very finely if he’s using it raw: “That’s what you want for persillade or salsa verde, say.” For other “raw” sauces and dressings, however, he crushes it to a paste in a mortar (the flat of a large knife on a board with a pinch of sea salt will also do the trick): “You get a very fine, smooth, pale puree without any lumps.” But bear in mind this is pretty heavy-duty stuff, so use sparingly, “unless it’s for something that’s deliberately very garlicky, like aïoli”.As for the central shoot, don’t worry about that unless it’s turned green, tough or is peeking out of the end of the clove, says Little, who earlier this year launched By Alastair Little, a homemade food delivery service in London. “If your garlic displays any of those signs, cut it out, because it will be bitter otherwise, don’t bother” – a sentiment Jackson does agree with. Life’s too short as it is, anyway.Far more important, Little says, is where your garlic comes from: “Avoid the Chinese stuff, which seems to have flooded the market in recent years – the cloves are way too small, and are over-strong. Look for European and homegrown crops instead: the Isle of Wight’s a big producer, and very good it is, too.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

It is not just that they are European and world champions, or that they are well set to win the Premier League for the first time since 1990. It is that their football feels a distillation of the modern game. It is high tempo, hard-pressing football with a fluid front three and extremely attacking full-backs.So universal do those traits seem to have become at the highest level of the game that teams who don’t play in that way appear almost old-fashioned. One of the reasons José Mourinho left Manchester United a year ago was because his refusal to press seemed symptomatic of somebody whom the game had passed by, yet the biggest doubt about his replacement, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, is that he too is fundamentally a counterattacker who struggles with what has come to seem to be the defining quality of the best modern coaches: their ability to organise an attack so that they can interact quickly enough to break down compact defences that sit deep against them.The other effect of the game’s growing financial imbalance is the way so many top sides, unpractised in defending, capitulate against sides who actually attack them. Barcelona are only the most obvious example, their 4-0 defeat at Anfield this year following the pattern established by heavy defeats by Paris Saint-German and Juventus in 2017 and Roma in 2018. Attacking is the modish way to play but it has been aided by a general downturn in the quality of defending. Even Liverpool established their commanding lead at the top of the Premier league despite keeping only two clean sheets in their first 16 games of the season. That lurch towards attacking play seems ripe for recalibration.This hints at a tension that exists at the highest level of the game: on the one hand there is the carefully co-ordinated pressing and attacking of Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola – and in their various ways Antonio Conte, Maurizio Sarri, Gian Piero Gasperini and Brendan Rodgers – but on the other there is a lust for celebrity to provide content that can be marketed across the globe. PSG have perhaps suffered most from the Neymar Syndrome but it is a wider paradox that the same economic drive that has elevated the superclubs so far above the rest is also a potential tactical handicap. Even Barcelona, once, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic notably said, a club of “obedient schoolboys” eagerly obeying Guardiola’s tactical instructions, have become something more decadent, their hugely gifted front three often becoming detached from their midfield against the best opposition.But none of that is particularly new rather it is a continuation of trends set in motion years ago. Where there have been significant developments in the past year is in Brazil. The national team’s 7-1 defeat by Germany in the semi-final of the 2014 World Cup semi-final, followed by embarrassingly early exits in the Copas América of 2015 and 2016, represented the culmination of a decade of insularity. Under Luiz Felipe Scolari and then Dunga they were crabby and cynical, debilitatingly in thrall to the cult of Neymar.Brazilian football, it seemed then, had ignored almost entirely the direction football at the highest level had gone. They didn’t press, they didn’t function as anything approximating to a coherent unit and they seemed to want to play like some mid-ranking nation from the late 80s, with 10 players subservient to one great star. But this year has seen a rebirth.In part that is because Brazil has become more open to ideas from abroad, with the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus at Flamengo and the Argentinian Jorge Sampaoli at Santos. Flamengo, in particular, have captured hearts with the beauty and effectiveness of their pressing football, winning both the Brazilian league and the Copa Libertadores. And in part it is because of the work done by Tite, who increasingly seems the calmest and wisest man in Brazil.After his success with Corinthians he took a sabbatical to study trends around the world and the result of that education has been obvious as he has produced the most sophisticated Brazil side in probably 30 years. Without the millstone of Neymar’s ego, they vindicated his change of approach by winning the Copa América on home soil in July. Brazilian football is suddenly forward-looking and exciting again.Underlying that assertion, of course, is a tacit acknowledgment that the best football, the highest form of football, is centred in western Europe, a phenomenon made inevitable by those same economic structures that have produced both the brilliance of Liverpool and the decadence of some of the other superclubs. A similar phenomenon, of the rest of the world following where Europe leads, was seen also at the Africa Cup of Nations.The final, in which Algeria beat Senegal 1-0, was the first since 1998 – and only the sixth ever – to feature two “local” coaches – although the term is awkward and misleading. Both Algeria’s Djamel Belmadi and Senegal’s Aliou Cissé played for the countries they continue to manage but both grew up in the same suburb of Paris, both are the products of European youth development and then of European clubs. Both have their sides, the majority of whom have similarly developed in European leagues, playing notably modern football, marking zonally, pressing and looking to interchange positions.Nigeria’s German coach, Gernot Rohr, was criticised by certain sections of the Nigerian media after his side’s semi-final exit for not playing “Nigerian” football but the truth is that such regional variations are becoming less and less meaningful. There is a form of football that has come to appear hegemonic and, while there are differences in how Klopp, Guardiola, Rodgers, Conte, Gasperini, Sarri, Tite, Belmadi and Cissé set their sides out, their basic principles are essentially similar.All to a greater or lesser extent believe in the value of a judiciously applied high press, all look to counterattack at pace, all have drilled their forward players into rapid interchanges and all have full-backs whose role is at least as attacking as it is defensive. This is top-level football at the end of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54fe09d40e7807cd80256fbdb1a819cbce0f6290/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47d44bde6bb083c442500663a69395ea","title":"january transfer window 2020 club by club guide for the premier league","story":"Arsenal need to strengthen their spine, Frank Lampard can finally spend and Manchester United could move early for their summer targetsMikel Arteta would like an active window and knows Arsenal have yawning deficiencies in the centre-back and midfield positions. RB Leipzig’s Dayot Upamecano and Atlético Madrid’s Thomas Lemar would be fine additions but would cost, in total, around £100m and Arsenal simply do not have that money. A January of wheeling and dealing looks more likely: Granit Xhaka’s departure would, if given the green light, free up around £25m but big-money additions might be contingent on letting Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leave – a sacrifice that may not be worth it. Nick AmesAfter spending over £100m in the summer, Villa can ill afford to go down. But they realise they will probably have to spend again if they are to blast their way out of relegation trouble. A new striker to relieve the pressure on Wesley would be welcome, and there is also a desire to improve the supply to the forward line, especially with John McGinn out for three months with injury. The Werder Bremen winger Milot Rashica is among the targets. Paul DoyleEddie Howe has repeatedly cited the difficulty of getting value for money in the winter window but a sizeable injury list may force his hand. The priority will be keeping hold of Nathan Aké, though they are powerless to stop him joining Chelsea should his former club activate a £40m buyback clause this month. Ryan Fraser is out of contract in June but the club have no desire to cash in on the winger this window, while Howe could recall the striker Sam Surridge from Swansea. Ben FisherA lack of cutting edge in attack has cost Brighton dearly in recent weeks and Graham Potter is likely to be in the market for another striker to take the strain off Neal Maupay and the veteran Glenn Murray, who has made only three Premier League starts this campaign. They have also been linked with rising Norwegian star Emil Bohinen - the son of former Nottingham Forest midfielder Lars - and Bordeaux right-back Enock Kwateng but do not expect wholesale changes to a squad still adapting to their new manager. Ed AaronsHave been linked with Championship players such as Josh Brownhill of Bristol City and Ollie Watkins from Brentford. Sean Dyche is always on the lookout for inexpensive upgrades and has done well in the past few seasons, though Danny Drinkwater could return to Chelsea in January if Burnley choose not to extend his loan deal. Burnley need to keep Dwight McNeil at the club a little longer, and to think about back up for Ashley Barnes now that Dyche has begun to ration his starts. Paul WilsonFrank Lampard has at least £150m to spend now the club’s transfer ban has been lifted and he wants to improve his attacking options. Targets include Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze, CSKA Moscow forward Fyodor Chalov, Timo Werner of RB Leipzig, Lyon’s Moussa Dembélé and Wilfried Zaha, while Chelsea could also make a £40m move for the Bournemouth defender Nathan Aké. Olivier Giroud will be allowed to leave. Jacob SteinbergRoy Hodgson’s pleas for reinforcements to his battle-weary squad look likely to fall on deaf ears with Crystal Palace’s American owners reluctant to increase a wage bill which is in the Premier League’s top 10. Yet given the shortage in attacking options and a number of injuries in defence, new arrivals are surely needed if Palace are to maintain their upward trajectory. The prospective departure of Wilfried Zaha would free up some funds although it remains to be seen whether Chelsea or any other suitors for the Ivorian will meet the asking price of £80m. EAWith an expensive new manager believed to have been assured of financial backing Everton will be expected to do brisk business as soon as the window opens in January, though Carlo Ancelotti has promised to concentrate on the Merseyside derby in the FA Cup first, and may need to move out Cenk Tosun and Oumar Niasse to make room for incoming players. A goalscorer and a creative midfielder will be high on the wish list. PWThe priority is a surefire winger or two ready to go straight into the team while the likes of Harvey Barnes and Demarai Gray develop consistency. The club has plenty to spend if necessary, including the £80m they got last summer for Harry Maguire. None of their top players will be sold, while the squad may be pruned, with fringe players such as Nampalys Mendy possible departures. PDQuite clearly do not need anyone this January, unless Jürgen Klopp has concerns about outbreak of illness or injury, particularly as Takumi Minamino has already been signed from RB Salzburg. Just fitting the Japanese attacking midfielder into an already successful team will be tricky enough, and Klopp has said there is no need to rush because the present players are performing so well. While Kylian Mbappé might get straight into the Liverpool side, almost everyone else would have to wait. PWPep Guardiola has insisted that no one will be signed despite how Aymeric Laporte’s injury and the lack of any quality replacement for the centre-back have hurt the title defence. The Frenchman is expected back for the Champions League which may now be the main focus. As this is the transfer market, though, never say never regarding a U-turn in policy and Guardiola would have up to £50m should this occur. Jamie JacksonOle Gunnar Solskjær’s budget is around £150m but only for players on his summer list who become available. This includes Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, Leicester’s James Maddison, Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen or West Ham’s Declan Rice. The manager, though, should prioritise Rice, Eriksen, Maddison or another midfielder as this is his weakest department. No one should leave unless, say, Nemanja Matic demands a move and the offer is good. JJIf mid-table security is to be cemented, Steve Bruce could do – rather desperately – with a reliable striker, thereby reducing his dependence on defenders for goalscoring. Bruce needs to sell to buy and hopes to offload midfielders Jack Colback and Henri Saivet, who together earn almost £100,000 a week and are not in the 25-man first-team squad. Dwight Gayle could be sold to a Championship club while Yoshinori Muto and Ki Sung-yueng could also be offloaded. Hull’s Jarrod Bowen is Bruce’s main target. Louise TaylorNorwich’s injury crisis has ended but one glaring hole remains someone to take the load off Teemu Pukki up front. That this is the most expensive position to reinforce, and Norwich insist they cannot spend £10m on a player, means even links to young talents such as Willem II’s Mike Trésor Ndayishimiye will likely come to nothing. The upside is that there is no pressure to sell either, despite interest in Max Aarons and Ben Godfrey. Paul MacInnesChris Wilder is well stocked for forwards but has tended to rely on the same players every week in other positions. He would welcome more strength in depth, especially in midfield and defence. He has a longstanding interest in the Blackburn Rovers centre-back Darragh Lenihan, while Nottingham Forest’s Joe Worrall is also on the radar. Sheffield United’s abundance of forwards, meanwhile, has restricted the playing time of Billy Sharp, in whom clubs including Celtic have expressed an interest. PDStill financially hamstrung from previous windows, Southampton are unlikely to spend big but Ralph Hasenhüttl is keen to strengthen at full-back to ease the workload on Cédric Soares and Ryan Bertrand. Soares is out of contract in the summer and happy to run his contract down, while Bertrand could also depart at the end of the season. Hasenhüttl is desperate to spruce up his defence with a couple of new faces capable of making an immediate impact. BFJosé Mourinho has said on several occasions that he understands the financial constraints at Spurs that he is happy to work with the existing squad. Does anybody truly believe His Humbleness? In an ideal world, Mourinho would like new full-backs, maybe a centre-back and a back-up striker. Whether the club can sell Christian Eriksen will hold the key to the budget. Mourinho’s first window with Daniel Levy will be an experience. David HytnerRecent results and performances have reinforced the belief that Watford already have the players they need to get out of their current predicament, though the defence, weakened by injuries, could be reinforced. João Pedro, whose transfer was agreed last year, has arrived from Fluminense but at 18 cannot be expected to have an instant impact. Major outgoings are unlikely though some seldom-used squad members, particularly goalkeepers and midfielders, will leave on loan. Simon BurntonDavid Moyes wants to spend after being tasked with saving West Ham from relegation again. A central midfielder has to be a priority and Moyes likes Stoke’s Joe Allen. But there are other holes to fill. West Ham are trying to sign the Middlesbrough goalkeeper Darren Randolph and want more cover up front. JSRising interest in Adama Traoré is likely to be rebuffed. Nuno Espírito Santo hopes to make a couple of additions to a squad that has coped admirably with its huge workload so far. The injury to Willy Boly means a new centre-back is high on the wish list, and Nuno would also like more options in midfield. A couple of Lille players have been eyed up – defender Gabriel Magalhães and midfielder Boubakary Soumaré - while Milan’s Franck Kessié and QPR’s versatile Ryan Manning have also attracted interest.

There were 87 minutes on the Emirates Stadium clock last Sunday, the score was 1-1 against Chelsea and Arsenal had five men inside the opposing penalty area as they pushed for the winner. The move broke down, Chelsea countered at pace, Tammy Abraham scored what would be the decisive goal and, for the umpteenth time, everybody questioned whether Arsenal had any defensive instinct.Manchester United are the visitors to the Emirates on New Year’s Day and it will be the showpiece fixture at 8pm, even if the Premier League table shows it is a meeting between 12th and fifth. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team have kept their season alive by rinsing attack-minded opposition on the break and the United manager would have licked his lips as he pored over the Abraham goal. Do Arsenal have to be wary of United’s rapier-like threat. “Very,” replied Mikel Arteta, the club’s new manager.What Arteta wanted to make clear was that Abraham’s stunning late counter was not the result of a structural breakdown in the team he is trying to reboot. When Abraham received the ball out of defence from Willian 10 yards inside his own half, he had two Arsenal players in front of him – David Luiz and Shkodran Mustafi – and three in pursuit – Bukayo Saka, Matteo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira. Abraham could see Willian flicking on the after-burners to get forward on his right and Mason Mount doing the same on the left.At that point Arsenal had the situation under control. They had five Chelsea had three. It was not a case of them overstretching in search of the winner, of a peculiar naivety.That said, what happened next within a reasonably solid framework was concerning. David Luiz and Mustafi chose not to engage Abraham high up the pitch, rather to retreat and retreat, all the way into their own box. After Abraham popped the ball wide to Willian, David Luiz could not prevent the low cross and Mustafi was then slow to react in the middle. Abraham outmanoeuvred him before shooting low past Bernd Leno. It was also notable that Saka seemed to be cramping up. Unable to move freely, he could not stay with Willian while Guendouzi did not get back at all.So, even as Arteta tried to take the positives in terms of how his players had “moved the structure” from attack to defence, he could see glaring deficiencies in the one-on-one work and fitness levels.Arteta delivered the last line with a smile. Arsenal are a front-foot team, their mindset is to attack and they will remain that way under Arteta’s charge. What he wants is to put a structure in place which will provide numbers on offensive and defensive transitions, allow for options on the ball and spaces between the lines. The early signs in this regard have been encouraging. What he needs to learn is the capacity of the players to operate at his tempo, to make the right decisions and execute them.The balance of the midfield will be key and, more precisely, how to find a role for Mesut Özil. Arteta’s predecessor, Unai Emery, tried everything with Özil but there was always the feeling that the off-the-cuff playmaker was not a natural fit for his style.Arteta has given Özil the central attacking midfield platform that he craves in each of his games so far – the draw at Bournemouth and then Chelsea – and there have been positive signs. Özil has created chances, although his ability to do that has never been in doubt. With Özil, it is all about creating an environment to have him switched on rather than drifting to find a consistency that has often proved elusive.“Mesut is putting in everything he has and his numbers, physically, have improved so much,” Arteta said. “On his own he can’t do it. He needs the collective structure, organisation and his teammates. He needs the team to play in a certain way to facilitate his strengths more and more in the game. That’s what we’re trying to do.“I put him in the team if I see every day that his attitude, desire and understanding of what we’re trying to do is there. The moment that this changes, then he won’t play.”Arteta felt a connection between his players and the Emirates crowd during the Chelsea game that “probably for a long time hasn’t been seen”. But will the bitter late twist have an impact on their confidence?“That’s my worry now,” Arteta said. “I hope the result doesn’t affect them too much. They were all physically blown and disappointed in how the game ended because they didn’t feel they deserved that but we have to move on. They have to respond. This is the challenge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53762a4c75a0f0c0140cf2f428481bec768018ef/0_156_2176_1305/master/2176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d762fa654565f7220b4d869f12a005b","title":"pep guardiola manchester city 2020s","story":"• City won 10 domestic trophies in 2010s, three more than Chelsea• ‘We are going to analyse as a club how we can do better’Pep Guardiola has praised how Manchester City became the team of the decade in England and is confident the club can elevate their status further in the 2020s.In the past 10 years City’s haul of 10 major domestic trophies is the highest, three clear of Chelsea’s seven and better than Manchester United’s five. Before the club’s first game of the new decade, against Everton on Wednesday, Guardiola said: “I think in the last decade we were the best team in terms of points, in terms of goals, in terms of everything – titles even. So congratulate Manchester City for that.Despite trailing by 14 points to Liverpool – who have a game in hand – Guardiola denied 2019 has been poor by pointing to last season’s sweep of domestic titles.Guardiola is certain City can improve in the next decade. “The big clubs in England are always looking forward,” he said. “We are going to try and analyse not just in terms of the squad but as a club how we can do better.”He denied the gap to Liverpool is solely due to the failure to buy Harry Maguire or another centre-back in the summer or an overall lack of major signings, having recruited João Cancelo and Rodri.Cancelo has struggled for form and Guardiola was ambiguous regarding the full-back’s future. “I don’t know what will happen in a few weeks,” he said. “In the summer we will discuss – if a player wants to leave, it’s simple, the agent has to call to the club.”Guardiola said he could strengthen the squad in January. “I never say never,” he said, before admitting City need to “pray” to have any hope of catching Liverpool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde2f2f31b97ddb0870c908553b678354e91ab2b/0_13_1987_1192/master/1987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=687a8456093fb496285443f1eafb0faf","title":"referee bobby madley dark joke premier league sack","story":"The former Premier League referee Bobby Madley has opened up about the “dark-humoured joke” that cost him his job.Madley ceased officiating at the highest level in England in August 2018, with the refereeing body Professional Game Match Officials Limited saying only that he was relocating due to a change in personal circumstances.Madley did move to Norway, where his partner is from, but only after he was sacked for sending a video to someone he “trusted” which apparently mocked a disabled person.In a long post on therefereesword.blogspot Madley explained that he took the video as a response to ribbing about a parents’ race at his daughter’s school and a newspaper article written by former referee Mark Halsey claiming he was making mistakes because he was overweight.Madley wrote: “The full page and headline of ’Blobby Bobby’ may seem funny to some but, trust me, being fat shamed in a national newspaper is not a nice feeling.“As I sat in my car with my phone in hand, a person walked past my car in front of me who had a walking impairment. The next part I am ashamed of. I took a six-second film, I said nothing. I did this in Snapchat, which is where I take all of my films that I intend to save to my phone.“On the video I wrote, ‘F**k me I have a chance of winning the parents race this year.’ Out of context I accept this reads shamefully. I accept that. However, my intention was that the joke was aimed at myself.“Had I have sent this to anyone on Snapchat, then I would accept the decision that later came as a result. I didn’t do that, though. I saved it to my phone. I sent it as a private text to somebody who I trusted. Somebody who understood the context of previous sports day comments and was aware of the fat shaming I had received.“I regret taking the video, I regret sending that video and, whilst it was a dark-humoured joke, it was just that. A joke. It was not intended to shame anyone, it was not intended to be seen by anyone other than the person I sent it privately to in a text message on my own personal phone.”Madley claimed the recipient of the video sent it to his employers and a disciplinary hearing resulted in his immediate dismissal.“At that point my world fell apart,” said Madley. “Whilst I absolutely understand the importance of an employer taking discrimination seriously, as they did, the decision to this day still stuns me.“I will never be able to accept that the decision taken was either necessary nor was it proportionate to the act.”Madley, who is 34, also detailed the threats and abuse he has received as a result of media stories surrounding his dismissal and the effect the whole episode has had on his life.“The last 18 months have been mental torture for me and, but for those close friends and family around me, as well as a strong partner, I dread to think what could have become,” he said.“I still struggle to sleep, I still suffer mentally day to day to try to find the person I am now rather than clinging to the person I once was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c12e80589705ea0a0ff7fcb4d10b45ce12de0d2/0_99_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ff17331d00e66d8bc14ae606203e687","title":"field of broken dreams footballs slave trade photo essay","story":"All they want is to do is play professionally, but for many young hopefuls from Africa their expensive journey to Turkey ends in exploitation • Photographs by Italo RondinellaFor months, Yves Kibendo woke up every morning at 6am. He would leave his house in an ancient area of Istanbul, returning late in the evening, after working for 12 hours in a textile factory.He was paid under the table, or sometimes not at all.But Kibendo didn’t come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to work long shifts in a factory, he came to play football.Fast and talented, Kibendo plays on the right wing. Hundreds of young African football players like him arrive in Turkey every year to seek their fortune. In many cases, intermediaries bring them with the promise of a trial at one of the big clubs in Istanbul. The players pay up to $5,000 (£3,800) for a “full package”, including visa, accommodation and contacts with talent scouts.But many are left deeply disappointed. Shortly after Kibendo arrived in Turkey he found himself with an expired visa and none of the opportunities he had been promised. Communities often invest all their money in these young people, hoping they will become rich and lift those at home out of misery. But in most cases these young men find themselves stranded soon after they arrive.Sometimes there is no one waiting for them. In other cases, the trials are nothing but a show, with no real link to a football club. The young hopefuls find themselves alone, in a country they don’t know, whose language they don’t speak. None of them want to go back, having invested and risked so much just to get here. Even when the “trial” does take place it is often a sham. The footballers are brought to small pitches on the outskirts of town to show their abilities. But actually there are no scouts to watch. After a few hours, it is all over. They are simply told they have missed their opportunity, even though no opportunity actually existed.When their visa expires they are stranded and turn to Istanbul’s African communities for help. They are ready to do any kind of job just to survive. Many start working illegally in factories – mostly producing shoes and T-shirts – or selling fake watches and perfumes to tourists. They are vulnerable and often blackmailed by criminal gangs.Julius Kugor has been fighting these scams for years. A former footballer, he is now a leading figure in the African community in Turkey and campaigns to stop the trafficking. “We have written many times to the Turkish embassies in African countries, but nothing has changed. The boys keep coming,” says Kugor.To give these players an opportunity, a special “African Cup” was created 15 years ago by the African community in Istanbul. In 2005, only six countries took part. Now the tournament includes teams from 16 nations. The purpose is to raise the profile of the players. On the terraces of Istanbul’s small Feriköy stadium, agents and scouts from all over Turkey are joined by colleagues from Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Cyprus and Bulgaria. They’re on the lookout for low-cost, talented players. At the end of the tournament, perhaps a dozen will find clubs.Sani Gideon got his big chance this way. A 29-year-old Nigerian, who plays on the left wing, he is one of the few who who has made it. Starting from this pitch in the suburbs, he ended up playing for Akhisarspor in the Süper Lig, Turkey’s first ision. But at the beginning it was difficult for him. He spent months doing cleaning jobs that paid only a few pounds a day. But today his story is an inspiration for many younger players. Whenever he can Gideon comes back to where it started and helps as a trainer for the Nigerian team.In recent years Turkey has become one of the major arrival points for migrants and refugees from the Middle East and central Asia. As well as the 3.6 million Syrians now living there with temporary protection status, hundreds of thousands of Afghans, Pakistanis and Iraqis have entered Turkey without legal documents. Faced with these figures, migration from Africa has not been at the top of the political agenda in Ankara.Yasir Bodur, a sociologist at Istanbul Şehir University, is among the few academics to address this topic. For several years he has been researching the daily lives of these immigrants, with a focus on working conditions and social environment. According to Bodur, the lack of institutional support exposes them to the risk of exploitation.“Football is a common passion helping to overcome the distances and open channels of dialogue with the Turkish population. But after the game, these guys still find themselves isolated from the local community,” says Bodur.Jean Claude Effa’Aessi is a football agent from Cameroon who also works forIstanbul’s African Cup. Before the games, he reminds everyone of the spirit of the tournament: do your best, play fair, respect each other. “There are so many talented young players among these guys. I try to give them advice,” says Effa’Aessi.Unfortunately, Kibendo could not find a team this year. Despite a stint as a professional player in Angola, he has had no luck in Turkey. Sometimes talent is not enough. Many clubs in lower isions shy away from signing foreign players because of bureaucratic and financial difficulties. However, Kibendo doesn’t want to give up. “But this can’t be for ever. If I keep failing, I will be forced to look for a plan B, meaning I will try to get to Greece on a migrant boat,” he says. “Even though I know I would risk my life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96f1935ba30ae03fe35a5e4b26ba3a4bdc6584df/168_0_4517_2710/master/4517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16460da53c249ac316ae015a513b3da0","title":"look into the light tips for great new years eve party snaps","story":"From unflattering flashes to making the most of Polaroids, a model and a photographer share advice on how to pose for and capture a memorable end of year photographNew Year’s Eve should be the perfect occasion for photographs – friends get together, everyone dresses up. But often by the end of the night you’re left with a stack of blurry, grainy or generally mortifying pictures. Tiah Eckhardt, a model and blogger who’s turned posing into a fine art, and Sonny Vandevelde, a fashion photographer known best for his joyous backstage shots, chime in on how even amateurs can walk away from the night with happy snaps they’re actually happy with. “The first thing I always think about is light ... where’s the light source coming from?” Eckhardt advises. “Is it an on-camera flash? Is it coming from the side? Above, below? I will reflexively change my position for the light ... There’s certain things that look flattering in photos and that people universally find attractive.” She suggests posing to emphasise your cheekbones, and ensure light is hitting your eyes – even if it feels uncomfortable in the moment – so they’ll look brighter in the picture. “If you’ve got a light above you and you tilt your head up to the light, it’ll cast a shadow down your cheek bones and makes your mouth look like a nice shape, it’ll get the light into your eyeballs. Where as if you tilt your head down, under an overhead light, you’ll look like a skull. You literally look like a decaying corpse.” If the light is coming from below “tilt your head down because that’ll get the same result – light bright eyes.”While it might work alright for a posed, group photograph, Vandevelde suggests: “When you take a photo on the iPhone with flash, it takes so long, and that moment’s gone.” He says in the seconds between taking the photo and the flash going off, your subject might be halfway across the room. “It’s not getting those in the moment shots. It’s not getting those candid shots.”“It’s hard to look bad in a Polaroid,” notes Eckhardt. In terms of posing for Polaroids, she suggests using a similar technique to posing for other flash photographs. “A Polaroid camera is much the same thing because it’s an on-camera flash, but it’s more flattering.”Vandevelde agrees: “I love Polaroids.” However, he warns “the problem is over time they will fade. So I always tell people if you’ve gone out at night and taken a whole bunch of Polaroids and have great shots, do yourself a massive favour and get them on a flatbed scanner and scan them at 300DPI so you’ve got a good digital copy as well. In 10 years time the UV will have faded the Polaroid, but you’ll have a backup.”He also suggests that the wedding-party trick of handing out disposable cameras can work for other social occasions too. “But make sure you save a couple for later on in the evening!”“It’s only worth working with a camera if you have experience with the camera and know how to change the settings,” says Vandevelde. This is true whether you’re using the inbuilt app on your smartphone, a smartphone app with more manual settings, or a DSLR.For instance, when shooting at night, “if you use a flash and just have a camera on auto-settings, the background might become too dark. You’ll have a really nice exposure on the subject in the foreground but then you’re not capturing the ambience in the background.”This is especially important for taking photographs with fireworks in the background. In those shots, if you’re not letting enough light into the photograph, the fireworks will “completely disappear”.If you know you’re going to be posing for photographs, Eckhardt suggests taking a quick snap of yourself before you leave the house. She has won jobs with this trick before. “I would get ready for a casting and I would take Polaroids or a digital photo of myself after I’d done my hair and makeup, and if I didn’t look right, I would keep tweaking it until it looked good for the photo, not good to the eye ... I knew once I left they’d look through 30 photos of me... So I didn’t do my makeup to look good for the person I was talking to, I did it to look good for the photos when they went back over them.”Just before the camera goes off, she suggests thinking about something that will make your face light up. Posing is “like any kind of acting ... with a camera you’ve got a second to do it. So you’ve got to think of something and then your eyes are alive.”Vandevelde suggests moving around a bit as you’re being photographed, “If we’re talking about night-time and party and event photography, I prefer to capture movement, even if it’s just walking … a flick of a dress … When people are talking with each other and they’re smiling, capturing that reaction is a moment in time, and it’s real.”Vandevelde suggests that you should not take your camera out at the beginning of a party. “I think the main key is wait till people have had a couple of drinks ... people will get looser, they’ll start having more fun.” From there “the more photos you take the merrier. Snap away!”Eckhardt loves candid shots, but she notes that often “it’s just luck. A candid photo is either brilliant or awful. And it’s brilliant because it’s capturing something genuine, or it’s awful because you’re doing something stupid. I think with a candid photo, four out of five will be awful and the other one will be great. Because you can’t fake whatever it is that you’re doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a93c5856512ff02e1418fb712b1e8e824e95add/0_381_5713_3428/master/5713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17eb33998d71fefe3298813f6145698f","title":"fox news drew in highest ever number viewers 2019","story":" Fox hit an average of 2.5 million viewers per night in 2019, making it the top-rated basic cable networkDespite a number of controversies and criticism from the president, Fox News saw its biggest year ever in 2019, attracting the highest number of viewers in its 23-year history.According to ratings from Nielsen, Fox hit an average of 2.5 million viewers per night in 2019, making it the top-rated basic cable network. Fox easily beat out third-place MSNBC, which attracted an average 1.75 million viewers.The network also aired four of the top five most-watched shows on cable news in 2019, with its right-wing programs Hannity and Tucker Carlson Tonight each drawing an average of more than three million viewers.Despite the network’s success, a number of hosts and commentators attracted controversy, often around issues of race and extremism, leading some advertisers to cut ties with Fox.Host Tucker Carlson was the subject of repeated boycotts for outlandish comments, such as when the host referred to white supremacy as a “hoax” just days after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. (Shortly before killing 22 people, the El Paso shooter posted a manifesto warning of a “Hiic invasion”.)This year, the network also lost one of its longtime hosts, Shepard Smith, who repeatedly criticized Donald Trump for attacking the media and sharing baseless claims. “Even in our currently polarized nation, it’s my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will survive,” Smith said in his farewell message.Trump had repeatedly attacked Smith while he was still at Fox, but the president’s criticisms of the network this year extended far beyond one host. Recently, Trump has lashed out against Fox for interviewing some of the president’s Democratic critics as the House moved toward impeachment.“The Dems wouldn’t let @FoxNews get near their bad ratings debates, yet Fox panders,” Trump tweeted earlier this month, referring to the Democratic National Committee’s decision not to air primary debates on the network. “Pathetic!”Trump has instead turned his favoritism toward One America News Network, a lesser-known outlet that was once dismissed by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow as “paid Russian propaganda.”But given the Nielsen ratings, the president’s supporters do not appear to be abandoning Fox News en masse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1ef7cd303b6ecdb7eb83dc85b3511f64e3aab8/0_352_5487_3292/master/5487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae21d7623e1702a874fed9ac6964421","title":"48 hour phone repair service turned out to be the wrong number","story":"Quick Fix Mobile said it would repair my phone within 48 hours weeks later, I want my money backIn mid-November, I sent my wife’s iPhone to a company called Quick Fix Mobile which advertises 24 or 48 hour service.

No, not the chap living down the road, but Steve the winter sky phenomenon. First spotted by auroral photographers in 2016, “Steve” is a purple band of light, sometimes accompanied by green lines, nicknamed “picket-fences”.Although Steve shares similarities with auroras – the glowing coloured lights visible from high latitudes during winter months – latest research shows that Steve is something quite different. Analysing photos of Steve taken from different locations, and using the stars in the background as markers, scientists have shown that Steve sits at between 130km and 270km altitude, while the picket fence is between 95km and 150km.Compared with conventional auroras, Steve has a wider range of wavelengths, is longer and thinner, doesn’t hang around for as long and appears in areas further south than a typical aurora.Auroras are formed by charged particles disturbing Earth’s magnetic field, but Steve’s distinctly different shape and behaviour suggests that his origins lie in some unusual chemistry involving very hot ionised gas. It’s likely Steve has been around for eons, but mis-identified as aurora until now.

Söll, perhaps the best-known of the resorts to Brits, is renowned for its night skiing, as Austria’s biggest night ski area, with five groomed pistes lit up with lights until 9.30pm, a floodlit snowpark and tobogganing day and night on special runs, plus a valley descent you can ski until 10.30pm. Ellmau, too, has night tobogganing.Every fun day on the mountain has to end with apres ski, and you’d need longer than a week to sip a spiced glühwein (mulled wine) or flügel (a popular Austrian ski drink of Red Bull, vodka and cranberry) in each village’s cosy mountain inns and slopeside hideaways. Among them are Soll’s Moonlight bar, with several levels, and Fabels in Ellmau, both with live DJs. From 7-29 March, there’s even more live music than usual for the Apres Ski Weeks festival, with folk music, jazz and rock in the mountain huts, and free ski guides on hand to lead revellers between them.The most romantic thing to do after dark has to be visiting the Alpeniglu village at Hochbrixen, where 18 igloos offer overnight stays, parties in an ice bar and an ice art and sculpture exhibition. The sudden cold that arrives at night can shock like a punch, but here guests are soon cosied up, wrapped in furs and sipping hot wine. Sundowners in the domed bar carved from ice are followed by a fondue at private ice dining tables, a snowshoe treasure hunt in the forest, or a nightcap by the campfire. Then you can snuggle into Arctic-grade sleeping bags on piles of reindeer furs where you remain toasty warm until the morning.Skiers of all levels are in for a treat here – it’s one of the biggest and most modern ski resorts in the world, with 90 cable cars and lifts accessing 176 miles of slopes across the linked ski areas of Brixen im Thale, Ellmau, Going, Hopfgarten, Itter, Kelchsau, Scheffau, Söll and Westendorf. Each resort has its own character and cool features: Westendorf has fun parks and a snowboarding scene Ellmau is known for its huge ersity of runs, remarkable viewpoints and fun parks Scheffau is great for learner pistes and easy cruising blues and Hopfgarten is the perfect place for astounding views, especially from the top of the Hohe Salve peak, home to a little pilgrimage church and where 70 peaks over 3,000m can be viewed from the top, including the Grossglockner, Austria’s highest mountain.If you’ve ever skied in one of those cranky old resorts, with lifts that break down all the time, poor piste maintenance, and shonky overpriced cafes … well, SkiWelt isn’t like that. This is a resort striving to be one of Austria’s best, constantly upgrading, and with a drive towards sustainability. Most of the resorts have snowparks, there are many long runs down to the valley, challenging steep pistes and backcountry for advanced skiers, including long scenic tours such as the SkiWelt tour, which has 21 valley runs, or perhaps your own ski safari across the whole area. But it’s perfect for first-timers and families too, with gentle beginners’ sections in each resort, and an easygoing vibe. Even the terrain has a friendly look, no scarily severe-looking peaks, just the beautiful iconic limestone outcrop that gives the SkiWelt region its identity, rising above everything.This season, a new eight-person chairlift, the Fleidingbahn, with heated seats and bubble cover, rolls into action in the SkiWelt Westendorf, up to the ski area’s highest point at 1,892 metres. In Hochbrixen, a new Zinsbergbahn lift will replace the old, combining eight-seater chairs and large gondolas, the first of its kind in the Kitzbühel Alps, which also generates photovoltaic electricity year-round. SkiWelt Brixen has a solar-powered system for snowmaking that only uses reservoir water from rainwater and snowmelt, there’s free charging for electric cars in several spots and the whole resort now relies on renewable energy. These efforts have won the region several awards. Those who want to minimise their own carbon footprint while visiting can reach SkiWelt by train from London St Pancras via Amsterdam, travelling overnight on the Alpen Express sleeper train to the gorgeous, characterful city of Kufstein nearby (worth visiting for a day in its own right, for its beautiful medieval old town, cobbled streets, towering fortress and Stollen, a cavernous, speakeasy gin bar that has the world’s largest gin gallery more than 1,000 varieties).Yet, aside from the investment in constant modernisation, this is a region soaked in the warmth of traditional Austrian hospitality. The historic mountain inns (of which there are 81) feel somehow polished yet cosy and rustic, and cater amazingly well for kids.The family-owned Kaiserhof Ellmau, for example, is right on the slopes, with a huge spa and wellness area, amazing views, kids’ club and an award-winning kitchen that’s won two prestigious Gault Millau torques for its creative twists on local classics.Others have play areas that would be paid-for attractions in their own right in the UK, with unique and witty touches that are pure magic for little ones.Across every aspect, this is an area that knows how to have fun.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76d9eec59a5d90cd91f89133d45db29383181215/0_222_6009_3605/master/6009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2242b7060c11d4113be1a751a87e7f9d","title":"slopes and the city discover the best of both worlds in austrias innsbruck","story":"Looking for something a little different than your average skiing holiday? Innsbruck has everything you can ask for Lanterns glow, fairy lights twinkle and the sweet smell of home-baked cinnamon biscuits fill the air as you walk down picturesque alleyways on your way to an underground bar. Thinking back over your day, you remember the amazing views from that first run of the morning on the Stubai Glacier, the natural jumps you found in the forest in Schlick 2000, that thought-provoking visit to the museum of Tyrolean Folk Art back in Innsbruck and the amazing dinner out in the city centre. Not a typical ski day, but the kind made possible this winter thanks to a new holiday concept for the Innsbruck and Stubai ski area: a ski and city safari.How you do it is up to you. The easiest way is to base yourself in Innsbruck, which is particularly charming in the build-up to Christmas, then make trips each day to whichever resort you fancy, or whichever one has the best snow conditions that morning. Alternatively, create your own resort-hopping adventure, staying a couple of nights in each place in a mix of different hotels.Another option nearby is the gentler Patscherkofel, with a popular snowpark, three kids’ areas, a lengthy three-mile run and rustic hut cafes. Both are great options if you only have one weekend to explore.With one of the longest seasons in Europe, typically September to June, the Stubai Gletscher resort is a favourite of ski racers and ski instructors doing their training before the season kicks in. It’s also a must-visit for tourists, with 62 miles of slopes and 26 modern lifts, amazing views from the top station at 3,210 metres, and a lively scene at the inns on the glacier.Close by, Schlick 2000 is a traditional resort with lovely authentic huts, where you can try some kaiserschmarrn pancakes and slurp jagertee. Axamer Lizum– which hosted many of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympic events – is perfect for experienced skiers and snowboarders, where you can deep freeride when conditions are right, below rocky crags not dissimilar in appearance to the Dolomites. It’s one of Europe’s best-kept ski secrets.You’ll also want to make time for Kühtai, the highest ski village in Austria. Hochoetz is great for families, as is Muttereralm, where children can run through the trees amid the breathtaking views.Back in Innsbruck, après ski might start with a visit to see the ibex and wolves at the Alpen zoo, a trip to view the incredible opulence and painted ceilings of the Hofburg, built by emperor Maximilian I, or marvel at the majestic Court church, where 28 imposing, life-sized bronze-cast black statues flank his tomb. You can swim in the pools and relax at the sauna and wander through Wilten, the hottest neighbourhood in the area.A Christmassy atmosphere takes hold in late November, with the opening of no less than six Christmas markets, linked by walkways illuminated by glittering crystal trees and sparkly lights. Each has its own character, from the traditional, peaceful St Nikolaus market in the oldest and least touristy area of the city, set against a backdrop of colourful buildings fringing the River Inn, to the Market Square, where kids adore the puppet theatres, carousel and storytelling. Be sure to taste some zelten fruit cake, traditionally eaten at Christmas. But at any time of year there’s a fantastic atmosphere, and what could make for better après ski than a whole, vibrant city full of bars? By the end of your trip, you’ll definitely be feeling like a local.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a525d194ef060402b04b3ecfbdf4faf72b26de09/126_211_3842_2305/master/3842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a7b7eb8faacb981d675a6fe29f95d00","title":"sport in 2020 calendar your month by month guide to the year ahead","story":"The Olympics and Paralympics head to Tokyo, Euro 2020 sends football fans around Europe, plus the return of the Ryder CupThe sporting year’s traditional raucous curtain-raiser, the PDC world darts final, takes place on New Year’s Day.

The traditionalists had better treasure the occasion since the England and Wales Cricket Board has given a cautious welcome to the idea that from 2023 World Test Championship matches should be of four days duration.“We believe it could provide a sustainable solution to the complex scheduling needs and player workloads we face as a global sport,” said an ECB spokesperson, who may well have spent too long watching Sir Humphrey on Yes Minister in years gone by. “We’re definite proponents of the four-day Test concept, but cautiously so, as we understand it is an emotive topic for players, fans and others, who have concerns about challenging the heritage of Test cricket.”That is a very cautious welcome. It is understandable that in England the urgency for changes to Test cricket is more limited. Test cricket works better in England than anywhere else in the world and the vagaries of the weather are more likely to intervene. By the same token, with shorter Test matches the scope for England players to participate in the ECB’s much-trumpeted but highly speculative Hundred competition is enhanced – assuming it is still going in 2023.Away from England Test cricket is less successful, though there were record crowds in Melbourne (for non-Ashes cricket) for last week’s Test between Australia and New Zealand. In fact that game, like England’s against South Africa in Centurion, was over in four days. The over rates may have slowed over the years but the pace of the game has increased rapidly. Joe Root’s Test record as captain illustrates that neatly he has led England in 36 Tests, so far, winning 17, losing 15 and drawing only four. However it is also worth noting that in last summer’s Ashes series every Test came to its conclusion on the fifth day. So under the new scheme that series might have ended up 0-0.In recent times there have been four-day matches involving Ireland and Afghanistan and it has been agreed that they should have Test status. A key issue here is the mandatory nature of the proposal. There is no leeway to be flexible. The four-day format in 2023 would apply as rigidly to Ashes fixtures as those involving new Test nations.It would be possible to expand the hours of play if the move to four-day fixtures was pursued. This was the case when England and Ireland met at Lord’s in July 2019 – when the game was over within three days. Longer days might not satisfy the stated goal of reducing workloads for the players, though the cynic in me suggests that this is not the prime motivation for the change. The simple truth is that the moneymen see an advantage in shorter Tests, which create space for more lucrative white-ball activities.However I have no philosophical objection to this proposal it makes more sense than the shift from 20 overs to 16.4, which we will witness in England next summer. It will also make sense if the surfaces are suitable for the four-day format. For example the pitches encountered in New Zealand on England’s recent tour would be dire for a four-day match – the one in Hamilton was hardly ideal for a five-day encounter given that a natural result was not possible as the ball declined to move for any type of bowler.At least the blandness of that surface allowed Ollie Pope to record his highest Test score of 75. Pope would have played in the first Test at Centurion but was laid low by the flu bug just before the match, whereupon he says he became “sick of the sight of my own room” while in quarantine. He is fit again now and expected to play in the second Test, presumably at the expense of Jonny Bairstow.Pope has had a topsy-turvy Test career so far, flitting in and out of the team and becoming a surprise international wicketkeeper.

Here are our six top tips to keep it safe in the new yearTechnology is changing our lives for the better yet it’s also exposing us to organised crime, online scammers and hackers – and whole industries built around monetising our personal data. But you don’t have to be resigned to cyber-victimhood. Give yourself, and your devices, a security update for 2020 and start fighting back.Yes, seriously. Your smartphone is a treasure trove of data, and while your passwords are likely to be safe from prying eyes (your password manager will keep them encrypted), what about your email, social media apps, contacts etc? Criminals can use these to change passwords, take account control away from you, and commit fraud in your name or simply steal directly from you. “Most people do not set any lock code on their devices,” warns Fennel Aurora, security adviser at F-Secure. A long password is most secure. Even if you’ve set up a fingerprint scan to unlock your phone, it will ask for your pin or password after a few unsuccessful attempts. A thief can try to guess your pin (and 0000 is still a common option) or obvious password. Smartphones can be configured to automatically perform a factory reset, wiping all your data, after a certain number of incorrect unlock attempts. For Android check SettingsSecurity \u0026amp LocationScreen lock, and on iPhones, SettingsFace ID \u0026amp passcodeErase data.While you may have read about smart speakers being at risk from hackers with maliciously crafted audio tracks or lasers (yes, seriously), in the real world there are more pressing security and privacy issues to consider. The account holder can see any requests that have been made of the device worth remembering when using one at a friend’s house. To prevent this, tell Alexa to “delete what I just said”, and Google Assistant to “delete my last conversation”. That’s assuming they have enabled the “delete by voice” option in the account settings, of course – which,. as a courtesy to your friends and family, I’d recommend doing for your smart speakers. While in the account settings, you can also delete past recordings for good measure. Using the “voice match” function for Google Assistant can prevent your personal results being available to anyone but you, and possibly Jon Culshaw. If you have enabled purchasing and have one-click payments “on” for your Amazon account, you can set a spoken pin to stop others shopping on your behalf and at your cost.If there’s one thing hackers really don’t like, it’s a liar. Especially if the fibs relate to those security questions sites ask you to answer as an identification method should you need to reset a forgotten password. “Most of the answers to security questions like these are easily acquired by hackers,” Tom Lysemose Hansen, founder of mobile app security vendor Promon, explains, “using simple trial-and-error methods based on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and even Wikipedia data, which give away much of our personal and family details.” Indeed, it’s incredible, and incredibly worrying, what a simple Google search can uncover. Instead of being honest about your mother’s maiden name, your place of birth, where you went to school or what you called your first pet, lie like a politician at election time. Of course, remembering fibs is harder than remembering the truth, and as with passwords, it’s best to avoid reusing the same ones for every site. Password manager apps can help, as they have a secure notes entry for every login.There has been much coverage of “juice jacking” of late. This involves a cybercriminal using altered USB charging ports in airports, train stations and hotels to infect your device with malware. You can carry a USB charger that plugs into a power socket or invest in a power-only USB charging cable to prevent this. A more widespread problem is that of free wireless internet access. “Criminals can exploit public wifi to steal your personal information, such as emails, photos, passwords, private documents and bank details,” Oz Alashe, CEO of CybSafe, says. Using a virtual private network (VPN) is recommended to reduce the risk. A VPN app creates an encrypted “tunnel” between your device and a remote server, protecting your data from snooping hackers. If you’re using your phone to check your bank balance or pay bills on the train or in the coffee shop, a VPN provides “a safety blanket that will help keep your data out of the wrong hands”, Matt Lock, technical director at Varonis, says.

He talks about his newfound notoriety‘When I read the script, I thought: ‘This is crazy. How can I say this?’” says Ruben Rabasa. The 81-year-old actor appears in just one sketch in Netflix’s surreal comedy I Think You Should Leave, written and co-created by Saturday Night Live alumnus Tim Robinson. But – as Focus Group Man – he provides one of the breakout performances of 2019.In the series, he plays a largely bald old man with a long, white mullet. Seemingly gripped by the fingers of the devil himself, he shouts out inappropriate comments in a focus group for a new car. Among his suggestions are “a good steering wheel that doesn’t fly off while you’re driving” and “no space for mother-in-law”. If these sound crackers, that is precisely the point Focus Group Man is the star of a show that is a pure white light of fully committed silliness.Unsurprisingly, Focus Group Man has taken on a life of his own as a meme. The internet is now riddled with endless GIFs of Rabasa dabbing and shouting catchphrases such as “teacher’s pet” and “STINKY”. There is a Ruben Rabasa soundboard online. Tweets have inserted him into Game of Thrones, and claimed that he is the boyfriend of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Rabasa remains modest. “I guess I get very passionate about things. I don’t prepare, it just comes right out.”His performance has also seen a huge outpouring of praise for the actor, who has been working steadily since the late 70s. We speak the day after he makes a surprise appearance on a panel about the show for the US culture site Vulture. “Did you see it?” he asks. “Oh my God, right away everybody started laughing and taking pictures of me, pop pop pop. It was unbelievable.”Originally from Cuba, Rabasa moved to New York, then later to Miami, where he says he found more work, and LA. However, it was not without its downsides. “In Miami, every movie I get, they killed me. So I moved to LA. The first movie I get in LA, I play a ghost. I said: ‘What the hell is happening?’” Luckily, I Think You Should Leave has finally pushed the jobbing actor over the top. With his increased profile, he is focusing on stage work and standup, and attempting to find a home for his sitcom, Americanos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2f4853c755f0d867b16cb370681493611b26b7/0_0_2558_1535/master/2558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3bdc2e420be5e97e176a1b9b4e3776","title":"were you paying attention its the seriously tough tv quiz of the decade","story":"Think you know everything about Don Draper and Downton Abbey?

Jenkins also denied Jones’ request to dismiss the lawsuit.An attorney for Jones did not immediately comment Tuesday. Jenkins’ orders were first reported by The Daily Beast.Jones operates Infowars in Texas. He is fighting similar lawsuits in Connecticut brought by other families of Sandy Hook victims for promoting a theory that the shooting was a hoax. A 20-year-old gunman killed 20 first-graders, six educators and himself at the school, after having killed his mother at their Newtown home.The families said they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers because of the hoax conspiracy.Jones has since acknowledged that the Sandy Hook killings occurred. His attorneys have defended his speech in court as “rhetorical hyperbole” and deny it was defamation.In June, the father of 6-year-old Noah Pozner, one of the Sandy Hook victims, won a defamation lawsuit against the authors of a book that claimed the shooting never happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/050810ec8b9d83d1beeb4e965c3796a7514c4d35/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a058c1ca893dde6463ba1967d5abf5d2","title":"republican wisconsin lawmaker black history month","story":"Backlash after Wisconsin lawmaker Scott Allen suggested white people who helped slaves escape be recognized for contributionWisconsin lawmakers are locked in a dispute over who qualifies to be honored during February’s Black History Month after a senior Republican suggested a list where the majority of named picks were white.Republican state senator Scott Allen circulated a resolution recognizing 10 historical figures for celebration. But six of those who’d been active in Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, helping southern slaves escape to freedom turned out to be white, according to the State Journal.The choice provoked a backlash from local black lawmakers, who said Allen circumvented the state’s legislature’s black caucus from choosing how to honor the contributions of black Americans.“If this was intended to be without controversy, you failed,” state senator Lena Taylor wrote to Allen in response. “Thank you Massa Allen for pickin’ whose we should honuh suh. We sho ain’t capable of thinkin’ for ourselves, suh.”Taylor, a black Milwaukee Democrat, asked why a white politician would be leading the selection, which includes six white abolitionists, four black slaves and unnamed members of the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohican Indians.“The fact that this even needs to be discussed is a reflection of where we are as a society,” she told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “I wake up every day as a black woman. I’m not exactly sure what it is that Scott Allen believes he knows better than me.”But Allen told the newspaper that the white people named in his resolution “exhibited tremendous courage to fight for just causes” and that his aim is to draw more white people into Black History Month celebrations.In a memo to lawmakers he wrote that it is important to view African American history “in a way that raises the prominence of that part of our mutual history so that it is the center of our attention” and to “demonstrate our unity by highlighting an aspect of American history”.“When we say that it has nothing to do with us, as European Americans, and that we should not be involved in Black History Month and the celebration of Black History Month, we’re missing the larger point,” he told the newspaper.﻿This is the third year in succession that Republican state lawmakers have collided with accusations of cultural appropriation over the celebrations.Earlier this year, they blocked the black caucus’s list of honorees until Democrats agreed to drop Milwaukee-born former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Republican party leaders argued that Kaepernick was too controversial.In 2018, Allen complained that David Clarke, the controversial, Trump-supporting black Milwaukee sheriff, who once compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan, had been left off the list.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10a62cb0b305dd7150a80e45a0345dd568234960/0_56_4913_2948/master/4913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=468bd06eccd37bec2e3c02c2221e7015","title":"uber postmates sue california ab5 gig worker","story":"According to a lawsuit, the law violates federal and state guarantees of equal protection and due process Rideshare company Uber and on-demand order delivery service Postmates sued Monday to block a new California law that could fundamentally alter how tech giants engage with workers.The law, set to take effect on Wednesday, changes the way businesses classify employees and dramatically expands protections for gig workers. It creates the nation’s strictest test by which workers must be considered employees and it could start a precedent for other states.In a lawsuit filed in US court in Los Angeles on Monday, Uber and Postmates argued however that the law violates federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process.Uber said it will try to link the lawsuit to another legal challenge filed by associations representing freelance writers and photographers. In mid-December, the two groups argued the new law would unconstitutionally affect free speech by limiting how many stories they can produce.The gig economy is based on temporary or freelance jobs. Often these are offered by app-based services like Uber or Deliveroo, where instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the \u0027gigs\u0027 they do. If they aren\u0027t out working, they aren\u0027t getting paid.Companies offering this kind of work argue that it provides people with a flexible way to be employed, whether that means doing some extra work on the side to fund studying, or to work around childcare demands.A major drawback for workers though is the lack of protection and paid benefits such as holiday or sick pay. There are also suggestions that by the time some companies have taken a cut of payments for a service, workers aren\u0027t making the minimum wage.And the roles aren\u0027t always as flexible as they first appear, with gig workers incentivised and put under pressure to work at times when a service is busier.In the UK the gig economy more than doubled in size in the three years leading up to 2019, when it\u0026nbsp accounted for 4.7 million workers. Up to one in seven working-age adults in the UK – about 7.5 million people – have worked via a gig economy platform at some point.The California Trucking Association filed the first challenge to the law in November on behalf of independent truckers.The latest challenge includes two independent workers who wrote about their concerns with the new law.“This has thrown my life and the lives of more than a hundred thousand drivers into uncertainty,” ride-share driver Lydia Olson wrote in a Facebook post cited by Uber.Postmates driver Miguel Perez called on-demand work “a blessing” in a letter distributed by Uber. He said he used to drive a truck for 14 hours at a time, often overnight.“Sometimes, when I was behind the wheel, with an endless shift stretching out ahead of me like the open road, I daydreamed about a different kind of job – a job where I could choose when, where and how much I worked and still make enough money to feed my family,” he wrote.The lawsuit contends that the law exempts some industries but includes ride-share and delivery companies without a rational basis for distinguishing between them. It alleges that the law also infringes on workers’ rights to choose how they make a living and could void their existing contracts.Democratic assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego countered that she wrote the law to extend employee rights to more than a million California workers who lack benefits, including a minimum wage, mileage reimbursements, paid sick leave, medical coverage, and disability pay for on-the-job injuries.She noted that Uber had previously sought an exemption when lawmakers were crafting the law, then said it would defend its existing labor model from legal challenges. It joined Lyft and DoorDash in a vow to each spend $30m(£23m) to overturn the law at the ballot box in 2020 if they don’t win concessions from lawmakers next year.“The one clear thing we know about Uber is they will do anything to try to exempt themselves from state regulations that make us all safer and their driver employees self-sufficient,” Gonzalez said in a statement. “In the meantime, Uber chief executives will continue to become billionaires while too many of their drivers are forced to sleep in their cars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ea2d700ca650d1b8045ead99d9c539d431be60/0_16_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad934410504ff003288b6d3c61c5ebf1","title":"what are your hopes for the next decade","story":"As the end of the year approaches, we want to hear what you hope the next 10 years will bringAs 2019 draws to a close, we want to find out your hopes, dreams and desires for the next decade.The 2010s have provided the world with an array of defining challenges: from the rise in political populism to the fight against the climate emergency.

She ducks under the fabric, wraps it around her neck and crisscrosses it over the crown of her head.It is almost dusk outside, but in this windowless room there is no indication of time as Gaye gets dressed for a concert starting at 9pm. Her veil in position, the 27-year-old old is transformed into Mina la voilée (Mina the veiled one), her stage name as a rapper in Dakar, Senegal.“When I sing, I am someone else,” she says. “I don’t feel anything anymore. I’m unwound. It’s like I’m another person when I’m on stage.”When she first began rapping as a veiled Muslim woman, Mina endured a backlash on social media. Knowing that she was not alone was what helped her endure it.Mina is a member of Genji Hip Hop – a collective of about 70 female Senegalese rappers, singers, DJs and graffiti artists. Starting life as a WhatsApp group in 2017, it has since blossomed into a civil society organisation that puts on concerts, holds workshops for women and speaks up about women’s issues in the west African country.The women have fun and support each other as they address social taboos surrounding women’s rights. Their movement is both global and local: recently participants in the WhatsApp group discussed viral videos of women in Colombia fighting against rape, promoted Genji rappers’ music videos and shared inside jokes.On stage, the performers rap and sing about relationships, society’s searing gaze on women, incest, family pressure and rape.“Hip-hop has proven it can change things in Senegal, whether its social or political, it’s very engaged,” says Genji’s secretary general, Wasso Tankoura.One fight currently being waged by Genji is against Senegal’s rape law. Currently, rape is treated as a misdemeanour crime and the women want it upgraded to felony status.“There is not a family in Senegal where someone does not see a case of rape, but no one discusses it because often the perpetrator is a family member,” says Tankoura. “It is very difficult to speak about it because the person who is raped is the one who is judged.”Members of Genji are not keeping quiet. They are currently in the studio producing an ensemble song about rape and the changes that are needed. So far they’ve recorded the refrain:No more questions! We’ve had enough!No more questions! We’ve had enough!The support of fellow members helps the women stand up to the often overwhelming pressure they feel to conform.“When you are a woman, normally in our country, they tell you how you must be,” says Mina. “You must, you must, you must. When they are always telling you what you should do, you won’t have confidence in who you really are, but when you are a rapper you have confidence.”One example of the pressure on women to conform is in their marriages, says Mina.Normally, wives are expected to stay home most of the time, do the cooking and cleaning, and not come home late – a problem that arises if a rapper marries, as concerts go into the night. Newly married, Mina splits her time between her family’s home and her husband’s. Her husband, Mamadou Sagne, is also a rapper, and she says marrying someone within the profession has made her life easier.But others are not so lucky. The rapper and Genji member Eve Crazy recently orced her husband after pressure from her in-laws to end her career became too much, she says.They say we don’t have limits,But if someone calls me a woman,Then they have already put up barriersTo what they think I can do.Eve Crazy gave up two jobs to stay at home, and cook and clean for the family she married into, but the pressure to dress and act a certain way continued. “I didn’t have any freedom,” she says, describing how subtle, daily pressures often weigh the heaviest on the women.According to Wasso, the cultural concept of muñ is a thread that runs through the issues facing women in Senegal. The Wolof language word embodies the complex idea of societal expectations that dictate a woman must have “patience” and “silently endure” any harsh realities – even rape – for fear that speaking out will upset the social fabric of the family and community.“We hold onto everything,” says Mina. “The woman must put up with everything. Marriage is like that. Even if you speak to your own parents, they will say that you have to endure it.”Hip-hop allows the women to go against the grain. “It talks about everything,” says Mina of their art. “Everything society does not want you to talk about. Rap does not shut up, rap does not have muñ.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0e4e6e9e4a5479dc779b7687dd231442c831016/0_122_1431_858/master/1431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79d5b47649d567a54b696e65afd5b403","title":"2019 year of unrest in the americas in pictures","story":"Wave of protests and violence against austerity measures and political corruption swept Bolivia, Venezuela, Chile and other Latin American countries "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1952d6b2e1e1d7dfb6954318297b4c8c5f79a403/0_156_4682_2809/master/4682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c897d5626deab99053f46437c74c0376","title":"new years eve 2019 celebrations around the world as they happen","story":"Follow all the celebrations as the clock strikes midnight and countries see out 2019 and welcome in the twentiesFrench president Emmanuel Macron somewhat provocatively used his traditional New Year’s Eve address to pledged that he would push through an overhaul of the pension system despite the country having grinded to a halt after weeks of nationwide strikes by trade unions.The 42-year-old, who has faced a bruising year of protests including weekly demonstrations by the gilets jaunes movement which have frequently turned violent, said he expected his government to quickly find a compromise with unions on the reform, but that the original principles laid out by ministers would be adhered to.“The retirement reform that I’ve committed myself to before you will be carried through because it is a project of social justice and progress,” Macron said in the prime-time televised address to the nation.“We will take into account difficult tasks so that those who do them can leave earlier,” Macron said.Hundreds of thousands of people took the streets of the French capital to watch an awe-inspiring son et lumière show on the Champs-Élysées, the chic Parisian street which has become the focal point of ferocious clashes between anti-Macron protesters and the CRS riot police.German chancellor Angela Merkel has used her New Year message to tell her countrymen that everything humanly possible must be done to tackle climate change.She said that there is good reason to be confident about the 2020s in her annual televised message, but she pointed to challenges such as the effect of digitization on people’s jobs and, above all, climate change.“The warming of our Earth is real. It is threatening. It and the crises arising from global warming were caused by humans,” she said. “So we must do everything humanly possible to deal with this challenge for humanity. That is still possible.”Merkel said that was the principle behind a recently agreed German package of measures aimed at addressing climate change, which include a carbon dioxide pricing system for the transport and heating sectors and lowering value-added tax on long-distance rail tickets.She acknowledged criticism both from people who are worried about being overburdened by the measures and from those who think they don’t go far enough, but said they provide the necessary framework.“It’s true that, at 65, I am at an age where I personally won’t experience all the consequences of climate change that would arise if politicians didn’t act,” she said.“It is our children and grandchildren who will have to live with the consequences of what we do or don’t do today,” Merkel added. “So I am putting all my energy into Germany making its contribution ecologically, economically, socially to getting a grip on climate change.”Europe must also raise its voice more strongly in the world, the four-term chancellor said, pledging to work for that during the EU presidency. She pointed to planned meetings with Chinese and African leaders.Merkel, Germany’s leader since 2005, has said that her current term will be her last.Russian president Vladimir Putin used his New Year’s address to call on his countrymen to unite for the sake of the nation’s future in an address that marked two decades since his ascent to power.Appearing outside the Kremlin in a televised message that was broadcast just before midnight, the 67-year-old leader spoke to Russians for the 16th time since Boris Yeltsin’s shock New Year’s resignation in 1999.“We live in an eventful, dynamic and controversial time, but we must do everything to make sure Russia develops successfully,” Putin said.“Only together can we solve the problems ahead for the country, for our society. Our unity is the foundation for accomplishing the highest of goals,” he said.“Our personal plans and dreams are inisible from Russia’s. Its present and future depend on the efforts and contributions of each of us.”Putin said he looked forward to celebrating the 75th anniversary of Russia’s World War II victory in 2020 and thanked veterans.Moscow is planning to host world leaders during festivities on 9 May, one of Russia’s biggest official holidays.An address to the nation from leaders in Moscow has been a tradition since the 1970s and is shown around midnight in Russia’s 11 time zones.In Moscow, Russians celebrating on New Year’s Eve watch the speech as they wait for a live broadcast of the Kremlin clock striking midnight and a spectacular fireworks display.British prime minister Boris Johnson, enjoying a winter sun break on the exclusive privately owned island of Mustique with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, has released his New Year’s message, saying that the country can look forward to a decade of “prosperity and opportunity” as it finally ends the “rancour and uncertainty” of Brexit.“As we say goodbye to 2019 we can also turn the page on the ision, rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long,” he said.“We can start a new chapter in the history of our country, in which we come together and move forward united, unleashing the enormous potential of the British people.”The prime minister, who won a thumping majority in December 12’s general election, said that he was determined to be a “prime minister for everyone”, including the millions who backed remain or did not vote Conservative in the general election.Read more in our story here, if you want to.Istanbul played host to a spectacular fireworks display which centred on the 15 July Martyrs Bridge which links the continents of Europe and Asia.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has somewhat soured the global party vibe by accusing the Trump administration of dragging its feet in nuclear negotiations and warning that his country will soon unveil a new strategic weapon.North Korea’s state media said on Wednesday that Kim declared during a key political conference that the North will not give up its security for economic benefits and will never denuclearise unless the United States discards its hostile policy.Kim’s comments came after a months-long standoff with Washington over exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament measures, which dimmed hopes for denuclearising the North through diplomacy.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have posted a New Year’s message on Instagram, accompanied by a new photograph of Harry holding their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.The picture appears at the end of a short video, little more than a minute long, recapping the couple’s year to the tune of Coldplay’s Clocks.The message said: “Wishing you all a very Happy New Year and thanking you for your continued support! We’ve loved meeting so many of you from around the world and can’t wait to meet many more of you next year. We hope 2020 brings each of you health and continued happiness.“Special thanks to Chris Martin and Coldplay for allowing us to use one of their songs.”Celebrations in Red Square in Moscow took place at 9pm GMT, and saw a spectacular firework display over the Kremlin. London mayor Sadiq Khan has promised tonight’s New Year’s Eve celebrations will feature the “best fireworks London has ever seen” in a statement that verged on the political and which will annoy his Brexiteer detractors.The capital will “project confidence” on the world stage through the impressive display, Khan said. “Hand on heart, these are going to be the best fireworks London has ever seen.”The mayor, a key opponent of Brexit, added that the “world” will be watching the display and he hoped it would show London was a “global city”.He said: “Fairly or unfairly, people around the world saw the Brexit referendum vote as the UK somehow turning its back on the rest of the world, including Europe.“The fear was, we would become insular, inward-looking, and what I’m keen to show is the opposite.“Yes we may be leaving the EU, but very much as a city we are still a European global city. We will continue to be open to people’s trade and ideas.“What tonight’s fireworks are about is demonstrating our confidence.“And it’s really important that we show the world who will be watching our fireworks that we are a confident, global, outward-looking European city.”The theme of this year’s display will look ahead to the capital hosting several key games in the Euro 2020 football tournament.The pyrotechnics show will feature more than 12,000 fireworks, with the display being set to a soundtrack “inspired by London and Europe”, according to a spokeswoman for the mayor.The event has sold out after more than 100,000 tickets were snapped up, and travel on Transport for London (TfL) services will be free until 4.30am on 1 January."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Tracks closed in both directions at Dunmurry as PSNI officers examine the areaAlleged Islamic State member said to be anxious to be reunited with daughter aged 2WRC finds Veronica Battles failed to establish discrimination against Kilgarvan MaceHSE says there is \u0026lsquopractical time lag\u0026rsquo between patient being fit for discharge and leavingDetectives arrest man in his 50s after complaint from woman claiming she was rapedJean Costello, played Rita Doyle for 20 years and was a stalwart of \u0026lsquoCarrigstown\u0026rsquoCitySafe plan will mean those engaging in anti-social acts face ban from all participating venuesSmall quantity of cash, cigarettes and alcohol taken during robbery of Cuddihy\u0026rsquos in OvensIrish-registered company is allegedly linked to a website publishing confidential dataOutdoor concerts, silent discos and best of New Year\u0026rsquos Eve TV to help you ring in 2020Thunberg, Brexit and Ana Kri\u0026eacutegel articles figure prominently in popular storiesInvestigators use facial recognition technology across Europe in a bid to find suspectGarda\u0026iacute making good progress in investigation into murder of Frankie Dunne (64)Adrienne Cullen died last New Year\u0026rsquos Eve from late-diagnosed cervical cancerT\u0026aacutenaiste cautions against immediate Border poll against backdrop of Brexit and efforts to restore Stormont assemblyCo-payments to form part of proposals to be presented to Cabinet in JanuaryPassport control checks moved from migration posts to steps of aircraftSiptu also suggests row brewing in National Ambulance Service in coming monthsUnconfined joy among some of Charlie Haughey\u0026rsquos most fervent supporters when returned as taoiseach in 1987Attempt to upgrade diplomatic representation in Tehran in exchange for help in securing release \u0026lsquocynical and disquieting\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128027.1577791964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greta thunberg column is most read irish times article of 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClimate activist Greta Thunberg speaks at the UN Climate Action Summit on September 23rd, 2019 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.

Photograph: Don MacMonagleAn elaborate plan involving the Irish Navy and the Air Corps was put in place for urgent contact with taoiseach Charlie Haughey when he holidayed with his family on a private island off the coast of Kerry each year. The Taoiseach owned Inishvickillane, one of the Blasket islands in west Kerry. It had no telephone contact with the mainland, nor any electricity. The Haugheys would spend part of August based on the island, and would also go for multi-day trips on the family yacht, Celtic Mist. Documents from 1989 released by the Department of the Taoiseach under the 30-year rule disclose detailed contingency plans for contacting Haughey in the event of an emergency, or for urgent State business. At least one of the Irish Navy ships – LE Aoife, LE Eithne, and LE Deirdre – would be patrolling in southern, or south-western, waters during the time, within relative proximity of the island. A note states that Naval Service ships would be carrying out gunnery exercises on the south coast during August. “The Taoiseach may wish to join them, informally, if he so wishes,” states the memo.It is known that Haughey invited boarding crews from Navy ships to visit the island from time to time during his time as taoiseach. The document also stated that “two west German navy corvettes may be sighted” near Inishvickillane and that the Asgard training ship would also be sighted on passage from Cork to Galway. If a helicopter was required, the note stated, the “Air Corps will have a Dauphine helicopter available at three hours notice from Baldonnel”.There was also an arrangement to deploy an Irish Helicopters aircraft from Cork Airport if necessary. 50 phone numbersThe document also lists more than 50 phone numbers from the town of Dingle and from the Corca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht to help locate Haughey when he visited the mainland. including Páidí Ó Sé’s “new pub”, Krugers Bar, the hotels in Ballyferriter, Ballydavid and Ashe’s pub and the Sceilig Hotel in Dingle, as well as Garvey’s Supermarket and local senator Tom Fitzgerald. The numbers of all the lifeguard stations along the south-west coast are listed, including Valentia and Baltimore, as are the numbers of the inhabited lighthouses, including Téaracht Lighthouse. These were presumably included to allow fast contact with Haughey when he was sailing on the Celtic Mist, or if the yacht got into trouble (Haughey and his sons had to be rescued from the yacht in the early 1980s when it got caught in a storm off the west Cork coast). Mobile phones were not commonplace at the time. The only mobile number that is listed was the car phone (with an 088 prefix) in Haughey’s official car, which was driven by members of An Garda Síochána. Haughey also insisted on knowing where other ministers were on holidays. There is a list of their holiday destinations. Most stayed in Ireland but then minister for energy Ray Burke went to Tirol in Austria on a walking holiday and environment minister Pádraig Flynn went to Paphos in Greece for a fortnight.While there were no major incidents in 1989, there was one in August 1982 when a murder suspect Malcolm Macarthur was arrested in the home of the attorney general Patrick Connolly. Senior officials had tremendous difficulty in contacting Haughey, who was staying on his island. When they finally made contact, it was on a bad line, and he allowed Connolly to proceed on a planned holiday to the US. In a gathering political scandal, that decision turned out to be a mistake. Haughey was forced to hastily contradict his decision and order Connolly back from the US. He also had to cut short his holiday and return to Dublin to deal with the crisis. It was at the press conference that he uttered the adjectives – “grotesque”, “unprecedented”, “bizarre” and “unbelievable” – that formed the acronym GUBU. It was later used by his detractors to describe his style of politics.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Blazes destroy more than 4m hectares, with new blazes sparked into life almost daily\u0026lsquoI have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution\u0026rsquoHolidaymakers sheltering on beaches told to enter the water if fires intensifyNew Delhi Letter: Cow safaris and ambulances among schemes promoted by ruling BJPFires have killed nine and destroyed almost 10 million acres, an area the size of JapanBiophysicist found guilty of illegal practice in attempt to alter genetic makeup of twinsNorth Korea implores US to offer new approach to resume negotiations40 degree weather , strong winds, thunderstorms mean extreme conditions expectedBayroot Pakbara contracted disease during effort to save young football teamYear in Review: The full horrors of China\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquore-education\u0026rsquo camps were exposed this yearDutch-made Fokker 100 bound for Kazakh capital lost altitude shortly after take-offJoint naval drills \u0026lsquocarefully calculated\u0026rsquo display of co-operation between three powersTyphoon Phanfone struck as millions were heading home to celebrate ChristmasLarge quantities of ash and burnt material could pose a threat to water quality in damsTyphoon Phanfone struck with 120kmh winds, heavy rain and floodingChinese man on death row for more than 16 years convicted over murder of family of fourMany settlers are eager to leave the region amid ethnic unrest and overbearing surveillanceMore than 4,000 people evacuated from Eastern Visayas region of central PhilippinesPolice fire tear gas at thousands of protesters on Tuesday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128024.1577788547!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"carlos ghosn nissan s ex head flees from japan to lebanon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file photograph from   2017 showing then  Renault-Nissan Chairman and chief executive  Carlos Ghosn  as he addresses a press conference in Paris. Photograph: Getty Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has fled to Lebanon, saying he wouldn’t be “held hostage” by a “rigged” system, raising questions about how one of the world’s most-recognised executives slipped out of Japan months before his trial.Mr Ghosn’s abrupt departure marks the latest dramatic twist in a year-old saga that has shaken the global car industry, jeopardised the alliance of Nissan Motor Co and top shareholder Renault SA and cast a harsh light on Japan’s judicial system.“I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied,” Mr Ghosn ( 65) said in a brief statement on Tuesday.“I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution. I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Tokyo officials have previously said the system is not inhumane and that Mr Ghosn has been treated like any other suspect.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan, given that he had been under strict surveillance by authorities while out on bail and had surrendered his passports.Mr Ghosn arrived in Beirut on a private jet from Istanbul on Monday, people familiar with the matter said.Immigration authorities had no record of Mr Ghosn leaving the country, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said.A person resembling him entered Beirut international airport under a different name, NHK reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese security official.His lawyers were still in possession of his three passports, one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters.Mr Hironaka, in comments broadcast live on NHK, said the first he had heard of Mr Ghosn’s departure was on the news this morning and that he was surprised. He also said it was “inexcusable behaviour”.Japan has extradition treaties with only the United States and South Korea, according to the justice ministry, meaning it could be difficult to force Ghosn to return to stand trial.While his arrest on financial misconduct charges last year ensured a dramatic fall from grace in Japan, he retains more popularity in Lebanon, where billboards saying “We are all Carlos Ghosn” were erected in his support and he was previously featured on a postage stamp.Born in Brazil of Lebanese ancestry, Mr Ghosn grew up in Beirut and has retained close ties to Lebanon.A spokeswoman for the Lebanese embassy in Tokyo said “we did not receive any information” on the matter. Calls to the Brazilian embassy went unanswered. A French minister said she was “very surprised” by news of Mr Ghosn’s emergence in Lebanon.Mr Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018, shortly after his private jet touched down at the airport. He faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman saying internal investigations revealed misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.The case cast a harsh light on Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was initially released in March on a record $9 million bail only to be arrested on related charges weeks later and then released on bail again at the end of April.His movement and communications have been monitored and restricted to prevent his fleeing the country and tampering with evidence, the Tokyo District court previously said.The terms of his bail have also been striking by western standards. He has been prevented from communicating with his wife, Carole, and had his use of the internet and other communications curtailed.Carole is now with him in Lebanon at a house with armed guards outside, the New York Times reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”, one person told The Wall Street Journal.A person familiar with Nissan’s thinking said: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court.”The trial was widely expected to start in April. Mr Ghosn’s Japanese lawyers have fought, so far unsuccessfully, to get access to 6,000 pieces of evidence collected from Nissan, which they say is crucial to a fair trial.Mr Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing closer ties between the Japanese automaker and its biggest shareholder Renault, of which Mr Ghosn was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover by Renault.Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer.”After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, Mr Ghosn used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business super-star status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life. - Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.New Year\u0026#39s Eve 2020 celebrations and fireworks around the world Kim Jong-un says North Korea ending moratoriums on tests - and touts \u0026#39new strategic weapon\u0026#39Boris Johnson says Remainers \u0026#39no less\u0026#39 patriotic than Leavers in New Year messageOxford University is targeting imams in bid to boost applications from ethnic minority communitiesComment: With these 10 bold reforms, Boris Johnson can transform BritainSoldiers\u0026#39 use of social media to discuss problems makes them \u0026#39mentally more resilient\u0026#39, says Parachute Regiment Major Prince Harry cuddles Archie in new Instagram image as Sussexes issue New Year message to supportersChild victims of mobile phone theft not reporting crimes to police \u0026#39amid fears of retaliation\u0026#39Comment: Our Armed Forces must adapt to survive this new decade of conflict\tYork set to ban cars from city centre by 2023 Hospital apologises after mistakenly telling woman she had cancer due to voice software errorBritBox accused of treating hard-of-hearing viewers like \u0026#39second rate\u0026#39 citizens   Comment: January is no time for abstinence - or even orce\tRevealed: Ottilie, the obscure French name, topping the  list of most popular girls\u0026#39 names in 2019Labour frontrunners\u0026#39 anti-Semitism \u0026#39cowardice\u0026#39 makes them unfit to lead, says ousted Jewish MPMother stabbed in unprovoked attack as she pushed toddler down south London streetSniffer dogs could save Britain\u0026#39s endangered bird populationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downright unchristian make january month detox abstinence","story":"So-called “Divorce Day” falls the first working Monday after ChristmasThere’s something to be said for the flurry of retrospectives of the last decade.

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking.

There is an attainment gap for poorer pupils inevitably, therefore, few pass the 11-plus test. It seems very wrong to spend millions expanding schools most likely to offer places to middle-class kids.\u0026nbsp“It’s clear that the government’s attempt to widen access to grammar schools has failed. With the current crisis in school funding, it is wholly misguided and unfair to reward schools which work for only a tiny percentage of pupils.”\u0026nbspGovernment gives £50m to 16 grammar schools for 4,000 pupilsBut the schools that saw a fall in the number of poorer children sitting the 11-plus this year suggested the figures could be higher as some parents do not disclose pupil premium status on registration.\u0026nbspMark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, has argued it is “too early” to judge whether the selective schools’ proposals for widening access have worked.\u0026nbspHe added that only a small percentage of children eligible for pupil premium currently achieve top results in Sats exams at primary school so grammar schools are “targeting a very small group”.Mr Fenton said: “This is a real challenge which will take years of patient effort.

The changes schools have made to their admissions policies will, given time, have a greater impact.”Proportion of poorer children falls in grammars sharing £50m in fundsGrammar schools to prioritise poor local children despite hostility Thousands protest against grammar school plans to boost poorer pupilsThe number of poorer children given places at grammar schools for September 2020 will only become apparent after March when thousands of pupils find out their allocated school.\u0026nbspLast year, figures revealed that the proportion of poorer children admitted to the group of grammar schools due to share the £50m fund fell despite pressure from ministers.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is incredibly hard to leverage greater social mobility through selective education because the reality is that middle-class parents have the resources to pay for supplementary private tuition to prepare their children for entrance tests while poorer families cannot afford to do so.”He added: “Expanding selective education simply is not the answer – however that expansion takes place – and the priority needs to be in providing more investment in high-quality comprehensive education which gives all young people the best start in life regardless of their circumstances.”A DfE spokesperson said: “We do not recognise this data. We are seeing an increase in the numbers of pupil premium admissions to selective schools in many that we talk to.“Selective schools can only receive expansion funding if they clearly set out how they will increase access for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.“We are collecting information from schools to monitor the progress of their plans and we will also monitor the number of pupil premium children joining the schools.’’Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Musk said the tunnel will “hopefully be fully operational in 2020”, and would be the first of many tunnel networks beneath cities in the future.“The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well,” he tweeted on Sunday. “If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBy drastically reducing the cost and time it takes to bore tunnels, the firm claims to offer\u0026nbspa radical new option that does not interfere with existing transport infrastructure. Cars and passenger pods would be pinged along electric skates through tunnels at speeds of up to\u0026nbsp155mph, before lifts return them to the surface.“The key to making this work is increasing tunnelling speed and dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more – this is the goal of The Boring Company,” the company’s website states.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.”A spokesperson for The Boring Company was not immediately available for comment but the Las Vegas and Visitors Authority told CNN that the tunnel would be ready in time for the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, which takes place in January.“We just broke ground mid-November and have its anticipated completion for the\u0026nbspCES\u0026nbsp2021 show,” a spokesperson said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The initial public offering raised $16 billion – the third largest in US history915 Gobbling up the competitionFacebook acquired Instagram in April 2012 for $1 billion, consolidating its position as the world\u0027s leading social networkOn 4 October, 2012, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had hit 1 billion users. \u0027If you’re reading this: thank you for giving me and my little team the honour of serving you,\u0027 he wrote in a blog post1115 Expanding its empireIn February 2014 Facebook acquired the messaging app WhatsApp for $19.3 billionIn June 2017, Facebook passed the 2 billion user milestoneOn 17 March 2018, news broke that UK firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from around 87 million Facebook users for the purpose of political profiling in the build up to the 2016 US presidential electionsDespite the scandals and subsequent #DeleteFacebook campaign, Facebook posted record profits just before its 15th anniversary, the equivalent of $7.37 from each of its 2.32 billions usersA study found that people are happier when they don’t use Facebook, adding to mounting evidence surrounding the impact social media has on mental healthIt also is backed by a range of assets held in a variety of currencies, in order to prevent it from suffering the same price volatility as bitcoin.\u0026nbspFacebook says Libra, which is set to be issued and governed by the Geneva-based Libra Association, will be supported across its suite of apps – including\u0026nbspInstagram and WhatsApp – while also serving the 1.7 billion people in the world who do not have access to traditional financial services.With more than 2 billion users of Facebook apps around the world, Libra could potentially rival established currencies like the US dollar and destabilise the current financial system, which has led to significant pushback in both the US and Europe.In September, French economy and finance minister Bruno Le Maire\u0026nbspsaid he would block the development of Libra on European soil because it poses a threat to monetary sovereignty.Facebook just unveiled a new currency to rival the dollarIn July, politicians in both the UK and US expressed concerns about Libra. During a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Libra chief David Marcus was told that Facebook doesn\u0027t deserve our trust due to various data privacy scandals in recent years.A spokesperson for the Libra project did not respond to a request for comment from\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspbut Mr Marcus has previously stated that the reason for announcing Libra so far ahead of its launch was in order to address concerns.It will be a long journey, he wrote on Twitter in October. I can tell you that we\u0027re very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the value of digital currencies to the forefront.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instagram doesn’t offer the feature, however, so you will have to go elsewhere.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThankfully, you don’t have to pick through all your pictures and find out the best ones: there’s plenty of websites available to do that for you. The best one appears to be topnine.co, which includes some extra features like the ability to see how many likes you managed to get over the entire year.Last year, that site ran into issues\u0026nbspin some countries, such as the UK,\u0026nbspperhaps because of more stringent privacy rules. Those seem to have been fixed this time.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

But if there are problems, you can still head\u0026nbspto the 2019bestnine site\u0026nbspas an alternative. It’s not quite as neat, runs quite slowly and sticks a fairly ugly watermark on the bottom, but it includes some clever features, such as the ability to choose any date range that you like.Whichever one you use, just head to that site, give it your username, and it’ll sort everything out from there. You can even give it someone else’s username, should you want to see their best nine.​Instagram’s latest update forces new users to reveal their ageThe site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.​The feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you’re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn’t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you’ve locked it down you won’t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram’s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren’t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.A version of this article was first published in 2018Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC.

I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If you’re not ready to go completely without, try Meat Free Mondays Grow your own: You don’t need a big garden. Salad leaves, chilli and herbs are just a few of the things that grow well in containers. It’s a low-cost way of reducing your reliance on super-market fruit and vegetables. Switch off when idle: Leaving TVs, games consoles, the washing machine and microwave on standby eats energy. Some appliances draw energy even when they are not being used and phone chargers are among the worst culprits. “Vampire power” costs each house up to £ a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Use energy-saving lightbulbs: LED bulbs can last up to , hours, while some newer models are good for double that. As they use far less energy, you will quickly see impressive savings on your energy bill each month. Which  magazine puts the annual cost of running an LED lightbulb at £., compared to £. for a CFLtype and £. for halogen. Over the course of an LED bulb’s very long letime, it can save you around £. Be a careful cook: Only use as much water as you need and cover your pans so you save energy. Overfilling your kettle is a waste of electricity so only boil as much as you need. Lose the plastic packaging: This wrapping is energy-intensive in its production and causes serious damage to habitats. Choose items that are light on packaging, and refill as much as possible. There is no reason to buy tomatoes on a plastic tray which is also wrapped in plastic. A loose tomato tastes just as good. Find out more about the supermarkets’ war against plastic. Go low: Set the washing machine at C or even C. Doing the laundry at C instead of C can be one third cheaper on energy. For lightly soiled clothes, try C. And make sure that your machine is full. Get free water-saving devices: Moving water around the country and treating it requires huge amounts of energy, so get in touch with your water company to find out what gadgets you can get for free, such as low-flow shower heads which use less water. Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest. Christmas truce will not last long.THE anti-democratic effort to block Brexit cost time, but it also cost money.Fine, ious big businesses might prefer we had voted Remain.But we didn’t.After the referendum, the private sector stood ready to do what it does best: Adapt and get on with le.But what businesses really dislike is not change so much as uncertainty.And Parliament made uncertainty an art form in the past three years.Now that we’ve got a new deal, a new Commons and a new Government, we should see new investment unlocked.Including money and decisions which were shelved during all the political hurly-burly.Let’s get Brexit done, and get Britain booming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We accept what happened but the process that led to this verdict was unjust.Rather than a simplistic suicide verdict, we wanted a narrative verdict which would act as an official record saying that while it was likely a suicide, they could not be  per cent certain because there are factors which suggest otherwise.Ian Singleton, assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, told the inquest that the death of -year-old Kelly could not be a cry for help because the location was so isolated that no-one would have seen her.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritanson  or   .The CCTV on the train was, unusually, not working, so the drivers vivid description of Kellys final moments is the main witness account of how she died.But Mr Stooke said: There are far more isolated bridges along the railway line and there are cars flowing across that one all the time, so I believe Kelly hoped someone would notice her climbing over the parapet and have her taken into a secure facility.The driver was in shock, and we dont blame him, so he may not be  per cent certain about what he saw.Plus, Kelly only had a few cuts and abrasions, and no skull fractures, after being hit - the damage should have been much greater.Maybe she tried to get out of the way but it was too late.Testimony from a mental health consultant and Kellys GP revealed that she had talked about suicidal thoughts similar to how she later died. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So that is exactly what we are doing.“This government believes in bringing everyone up, not in punishing those who succeed.“Getting Brexit done doesn’t just mean passing legislation, to me it means helping people so that they know the country works for them.”The new minimum pay level keeps the Chancellor on course to meet the pledge he made in October to push it up to £. by , which is two-thirds of median earnings.From my early years in Rochdale and Bristol to my time serving as a cabinet minister, this is my personal mission. Because this government believes in bringing everyone up, not in punishing those who succeed.That means levelling up across regions which have been neglected for too long levelling up our public services by investing in new hospitals, , police and making vocational education a leline of opportunity for young people. And levelling up by helping ordinary working people deal with the cost of living.Lower paid workers are crucial to our economy, whether carers for our elderly and disabled relatives, hospitality staff ensuring we have a great festive season or manufacturers producing world-class goods. Many of them were working over Christmas instead of being sat down and relaxed with loved ones.Because we’ve been responsible in managing the economy, employment is at record high. But this Government is also focused on helping people make their money go further and giving you and your family a better quality of le.In , we introduced the National Living Wage, which gave British workers their biggest pay rise in nearly two decades.I believe the best possible start to  for millions of hard-working people on lower wages is to give them a pay rise. So that is exactly what we are doing, by increasing the National Living Wage by an inflation-busting .% to £. - £ a year extra - for a full-time worker from April. I look back and think what a dference that percentage wage rise would have made for my parents.It’s the largest ever cash increase - proving that hard work does pay under this Government.But I am not stopping there. I confirmed last autumn that we had the ambition to end low pay over the next five years by setting a target for the NLW to reach two-thirds of average earnings in the coming years.And as well as paying more, we want more people to benefit. The NLW currently kicks in on your twenty fth birthday, but we want younger generations too to be able to secure good jobs, save towards a home and achieve their dreams. So while this year minimum wage rates for those workers, including apprentices, will also increase between .% and .%, I have announced plans to ensure that the highest rate is extended to workers aged  and over in , and to those aged  and over within five years.We know these rises must be paid for – so we’re being ambitious but responsible. We are carefully building our approach to ending low pay so jobs are protected with increases that businesses can plan for, while we invest in our public services so resource isn’t erted from the frontline to cover workforce pay.Getting Brexit done doesn’t just mean passing legislation, to me it means helping people so that they know the country works for them. So  will be the year of levelling up, because we are greater together than the sum of our parts. Happy New Year.Boris Johnson also said the move helps correct the injustice of “for too long, people haven’t seen the pay rises they deserve”.The PM added: “As we enter a new decade, we’re setting our sights higher, to help people earn more over the next five years and level up access to opportunity across our great country”.Younger workers will also get wage boosts, with the rate for - year olds going up by .% from £. to £. an hour.There is a .% increase for - year olds, from £. to £., and a .% increase from £. to £. for under s.Since the National Living Wage was introduced in , the nation’s lowest paid who do a  hour week will have had a wage increase of £,.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil”and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These are just some of the fascinating details revealed this week in official documents from the s and aposs, newly declassied by National Archives in Dublin and London. The files were released under the  year rule -  years in Ireland - which requires secret documents to be declassied after two decades unless there is a good reason not to. UK documents are revealed by the National Archives at Kew unless they would cause damage to the countryaposs image, national security or foreign relations. In the UK, documents are released twice a year in August and January - but theyaposre still playing catch-up with declassications, after the time limit was reduced from  years to  in . Hereaposs a round-up of the most interesting stories that emerged in this yearaposs releases. . Nuclear weapons could be hidden inside a Northern Ireland mountain  Nuclear weapons could be sited at underground facilities inside a mountain in Northern Ireland, Dublin’s most senior intelligence official advised the government. Colonel L Buckley, then Ireland’s Director of Intelligence, was asked for a briefing for Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Barry on the possibility of nuclear missiles being on the island in November . In a response marked “Confidential”, Buckley complains that he doesn’t have “the monitoring or surveillance systems” to confirm the movements of UK ships, aircraft and support systems. “Suffice to say any such information would be given the highest security classication and only be available to UK or or other military personnel on the strictest ‘need-to-know’ basis at the highest level,” he added.  But he said the harbour at Sydenham in Belfast could accommodate Royal Navy or Nato ships “equipped with nuclear missiles or weapons”. And he said a military base at Benbradagh Mountain,overlooking Dungiven in Co Derry, the second highest mountain in the Sperrins which was used by US forces during the Cold War to communicate with its north Atlantic fleet, could hold nuclear weapons. “Ben Bradaigh NEof Dungiven has underground facilities, which were originally constructed by US forces for the storage of conventional high explosives but were subsequently redesigned and are understood to be suitable for the storage of nuclear weaponsso required,” he wrote.  Margaret Thatcher “grabbed her handbag” and “stormed out” of a meeting with the Belgian prime minister in a row over the extradition of an Irish priest wanted in London over alleged connections to the IRA A senior Tory adviser told an Irish diplomat about the incident by way of contrasting Thatcher’s “quite natural” way with then Irish Taoiseach Charlie Haughey, adding there was “a lot to be played for between them”.  . Thatcher kept wrongly convicted Birmingham Six in jail to dodge scandal The Thatcher government was reluctant to free the Birmingham Six because of pressure from Tory hardliners and concerns it would cause a “scandal”. A Home Office official admitted the fears to Irish diplomats  years ago. The Irish government was leaned on not to pursue their case with the European Court of Human Rights. PM Margaret Thatcher’s government also feared a backlash from the media. Paddy Hill, Gerry Hunter, Johnny Walker, Hugh ­Callaghan, Richard McIlkenny and Billy Power were freed in  for one of the worst miscarriages of justice after being ly convicted in  for the Birmingham pub bombings that killed  people in November .  . Thatcheraposs fury over aposher boysapos killed in Northern Ireland Margaret Thatcher had warned Northern Ireland’s police chief that she would no longer send “her boys over in waves to be killed” in a rancorous row over who was to blame for the slaughter of eight soldiers in an IRA bomb. Sir John Hermon, then chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, was upset by the “neo-colonial connotations” and “World War I overtones” of the Prime Minister’s dressing down, which he took as distancing of herself from the region, newly declassied files disclose. The IRA detonated a massive roadside bomb, containing  pounds of semtex, as an unmarked bus carrying members from the Light Infantry made its way along the A at Ballygawley, Co Tyrone, after midnight on August , . Eight soldiers - all aged between  and  - were killed and another  were injured. They had been making their way from the airport to their base at Omagh. Six months later, Sir John confided in a diplomat about the “panic reaction” from Downing Street in the wake of the attack as well as tensions between the police and the army over whose fault it was for the deadly security lapse.  . Tory who avoided aposblacks and Irishapos feared for apossecurity implicationsapos of allowing Irish MPAn aposunsavouryapos Tory MP who openly admitted avoiding the blacks and Irish in his constituency feared the security implications of allowing Irish politicians into Westminster .Nicholas Budgen, who took over Enoch Powell’s House of Commons seat for Wolverhampton South West, agreed to have lunch with Richard Ryan, a diplomat in the Irish Embassy in London, in March , a report of the meeting marked “confidential” shows. Ryan was trying to bolster support - and stymie opposition - to the nascent British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, made up of politicians in London and Dublin. . Officials feared John Major would have to aposhide behind plantapos as Bill Clinton visited UK  Officials feared the Prime Minister would be forced to hide behind a pot plant to avoid shaking a Sinn Fein leaderaposs hand. Aides were worried about a chance meeting between PM John Major and Sinn Feinaposs Gerry Adams during US President Bill Clintonaposs trip to the UK. The American President visited London and Belfast in November . Stormont aide Robert Crawford issued the alert for potential embarrassment in a memo to Mr Majoraposs private secretary, Edward Oakden. Mr Crawford wrote: Sinn Feinwill almost certainly be invited to the reception. “We cannot see a way of the Prime Minister avoiding Gerry Adams without reverting to the undignied hiding-behind-the-potted plants scenario, which creates almost as valuable a news story as the first handshake.  Ministers were accused of “manipulating” the grieving Dunblane community in the aftermath of the massacre of  children and their teacher. Parents of youngsters gunned down by murderer Thomas Hamilton demanded an urgent clarication from Prime Minister John Major days after the  tragedy, amid fears the Government was about to U-turn on a pledge to help, a newly-released letter reveals. Relatives were angered by reports Scottish Minister Michael Forsyth was abandoning a pledge to offer taxpayersapos money to rebuild the gym where Hamilton slaughtered five and six-year-olds. The PM and Mr Forsyth were among a delegation to visit the Scottish town after the March  attack. Mr Major confirmed to the headteacher that finding Government cash for the project would not be a problem. Gerry McDermott, spokesman for the school board of governors, said the gesture was a source of great comfort to the community, relieving strain from those most closely involved.  John Major skipped seeing Britainaposs only gold medal of the  Olympics because he wanted to watch cricket instead, official records suggest. Aides to the then Prime Minister tried to persuade him to fly to the US to attend the Atlanta Games. Plans included watching the final of the coxless pairs rowing, featuring Matthew Pinsent and Steve Redgrave, which delivered Britainaposs only gold medal at the Games. But cricket fan Mr Major pulled out of a three-night trip to America at the end of July, despite months of organisation behind the scenes, amid concerns from aides he would go to Englandaposs match with Pakistan. Downing Street private secretary Rachael Reynolds wrote to the PM saying: I understand that you are thinking of staying here for the Lordaposs Test in preference to going to the Olympics. “While having to declare certain personal interest here ... I do think it would be a pityyou were to give up going entirely.”  . Heathrow nearly had its name changed to pay tribute to Winston Churchill John Major considered renaming Heathrow Airport after Sir Winston Churchill. The then Prime Minister believed the idea of making Britain’s biggest airport a memorial to the Second World War leader was “intriguing”. The Tory leader asked senior Whitehall aides to explore the proposal after London businessman Harvey Spack suggested Sir Winston Churchill Airport was better than “stupid” Heathrow. The premieraposs reply to Mr Spack said: “Thank you for your letter of  September and for your intriguing idea about renaming Heathrow airport after Sir Winston Churchill. “I am looking into this, and I am grateful to you for raising it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"help buy hijacked rich 10000","story":"NewsHelp to Buy hijacked by rich as , loans handed to £, earnersEXCLUSIVE Some , government backed loans in the governments flagship programme to help struggling families onto the housing ladder have been handed to families on £, or more a yearShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC News \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

A new beginning. A new chance to get things right. And by goodness we need it. There were many great moments in the past decade – the London Olympics, two royal weddings and Nessa finally proposing to Smithy. But there were plenty more moments from which we can take no pride at all. Moments which have cast a terrible stain on this country’s history. The greed of underregulated bankers coupled with an ideological policy of austerity led to a decade of misery for many. Foodbanks, practically unheard of  years ago, popped up in almost every town and city. Rough sleepers lined our streets. Waiting lists for our brilliant but beleaguered NHS grew longer. The cult of inidualism took hold, crushing beneath it our nation’s greatest attributes: moderation, politeness and “agreeing to disagree”. Instead we disagreed on anything – and everything. RIPPED Brexit hammered a stake through our nation’s soul which the extremists, the know-it-alls and the downright evil pushed and pulled until we were ripped entirely in two. Technological change whirred so fast that promised winds of change became a destructive tornado. Billion dollar social media firms peddled fake news, meddled in elections and shared “how to” suicide guides for our kids. Amazon ravaged our high streets and sneered at our tax system. Smartphones intended to connect us only isolated us. We slipped into a loneliness crisis and mental health catastrophe. And so austerity, inidualism and technology allied themselves to fracture our communities and leave us adrt in a perfect storm of sadness. Hundreds of thousands of shops, libraries, pubs, youth clubs, bus services and bingo halls closed. The glue which holds this nation together dried up and flaked off. And all that time we continued to overheat, overuse and undervalue the planet on which we live. And yet. There is hope. There is always hope. For we are a country which has taken on greater challenges than those we face today – and survived. Looking around over the past few festive weeks we have all been reminded how the British sense of family, togetherness and having a laugh come what may, remains a potent force. And now, in this new decade, we must use this togetherness as the weapon with which we fight back. As Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby says tomorrow we must start healing the isions we’ve seen over recent years.  The Daily Mirror has been the Heart of Britain for  years. We are the voice of the millions of compassionate, decent, hard-working people who are the backbone of this nation. DEBATEWe speak to and for readers on both sides of the Brexit debate, young and old, from the Northand the South, in big cities and small towns.And this year we – readers and writers together – will do our bit to fight back against those who would ide us. We will step up our brilliant Britain Talks project which brings together people with dfering views over a cup of tea to find common ground. We will relentlessly battle against social media companies, online giants and gig economy employers who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.  We will hold our politicians to account for the language they use and the promises they make. We will again throw open the doors of the Mirror newsroom to young people to report the news. But we’ll never ever take for granted our loyal, more senior readers. We will every day tell stories of how the indomitable British spirit has achieved great things, just as we do at the Mirror’s uplting Pride of Britain Awards.

As the Queen prepared to leave the church, Charlotte joined her fellow royals to see her great-grandmother off.The family stood on the church steps and as the Queen was driven away in a black Bentley, the Duchess of Cambridge could be seen curtsying at the car.This sign of respect was followed by another little curtsy - this time from her daughter. The princess looked adorable as she lightly held the hem of her green coat and gracefully bobbed down, copying her mumaposs gesture.

Donna Cox, , booked a one-way ticket to Vietnam in September to celebrate completing her degree. But after travelling on to Cambodia she noticed a painful mosquito bite on her right leg. When Donna, of Rochdale, Gloucestershire flew back to the UK, she was diagnosed with the flesh-eating bug necrotising fasciitis.Things got worse when the bug resulted in her developing sepsis which nearly killed her and led to her nearly having her leg amputated, the Manchester Evening News reported .Donna, who had all of the necessary vaccinations before her trip, said: I was having the time of my le. I met some absolutely amazing people. I never expected it all to end as quickly as it did. There was a lump around the bite on my shin. It just didnapost seem right. Iaposd been bitten loads when I was over there. The mosquitoes seemed to love me. But the redness and the pain around this one bite started to spread up and down my leg. Donna went to a pharmacist to get antibiotic cream on the advice of a hostel manager, but a day later the swelling ed and it became too painful for her to put weight on her right foot.  Donna said: I remember saying to some of the girls in the room: aposGuys, Iaposm not being dramatic but I think Iaposm going to die or lose my legapos. I was only joking but it almost ended up coming true. With cash running low, Donna decided to book a flight back to the UK in October. It was a painful flight back and when she made it to Rochdale the bite only got worse. Donna ended up in Rochdale Infirmary AE where an x-ray revealed a aposcollectionapos under her leg, where doctors consulted with the North Manchester Infectious Diseases team. The next day Donna was rushed to The Royal Oldham Hospital where she was diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis. The rare bacterial infection spreads rapidly and can be fatal. Donna started to fall unconscious and developed sepsis, causing her body to start to shut down. The following four days were a blur for Donna. She underwent three operations on her leg and was diagnosed with compartment syndrome. Donna signed a form consenting to her leg being amputated should her condition worsen. Another limb-saving procedure to ease the pressure building in her right leg followed.  Donna said: The bone in my leg had softened and the necrotising fasciitis was eating my leg. It was only because I was young and strong that I survived. There were many traumatising moments for Donna during her time in hospital. Medics left her wound open to ease the pressure in her lower leg, before closing it with  staples. At one stage Donna wore an eye-mask so she didnapost have to look at her leg. Doctors told her thatshe had gone to hospital four hours later she would have died. Donnaaposs illness has changed her le forever, and while she survived, she has lost all sensation in her lower right leg and is now learning how to walk again.

Harry Weir was diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease aged two and has been seriously ill most of his le, with daily dialysis treatment helping keep him alive.But thanks to the heartwarming act by his dad, Mike and the anonymous donor he is now on the road to recovery, Wales Online reports .Mike, from Llantrisant, Glamorgan, Wales, said: We understand that a transplant is not a cure and le will never be normal for Harry or us. However we now have a healthier son and hopes and dreams to live for. Harry was born with ing kidneys but was regularly ill as a baby and toddler and suffered from constipation and viruses. It was only when he was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant, with a virus that a urine test showed he had issues with his kidneys. At three years old Harry had a biopsy and was diagnosed with FSGS , a chronic kidney condition in both kidneys that would only get worse.Mike said: We dealt with Harryaposs illness for many years. We knew when his kidneys were struggling as he started having headaches and it would then be time to get the sick bowl out as he would have hours of extreme vomiting and eventually fall asleep.This would often happen after heaposd eaten too much or exerted himself. At this point Harryaposs kidneys were ing at % and he was on a lot of medication to try and stem the decline in his kidney . It was when Harry turned five years old that his health signicantly deteriorated and his kidneydropped to just %. He was so poorly that the doctors suggested an intense chemotherapy session as a last chance to save his kidneys. Unfortunately this didnapost work and our little boy was in desperate need of a kidney as his kidneydropped to %. Harry was discharged from hospital but spent two years on dialysis which he would need at home for  hours every night. Mike added: My we and I had to be trained on how to administer the dialysis. It was so noisy and therefore everyoneaposs sleep was disrupted. It was tough on the whole family. My we Karen and I hardly spent any time together. Harry’s older brother Liam had a tough time, bless him, and Iaposll never forget him coming into my bedroom one evening askingHarry was going to die.  As soon as Harryaposs kidneys failed his family were all tested to seethey were a match – and luckily his mum Karen was. But a CT scan showed she had too many arteries in her kidneys which would make the operation too risky. But the family were given a leline when doctors suggested exploring pooled donation involving  Mike and another donor - where two or more pairs of donors and recipients are involved in the swap. Mike said there are around  children in the UK on the kidney transplant list, which meant Harry was on the list for  months without a single phone call. Every quarter, the UK Living Kidney Sharing Schemeassess the donors and recipients to seethere is a match. These operations are coordinated so they are done at the same time. We were all set to go, a week before Christmas, when we found out that our matched recipient wasnapost well enough to proceed, said Mike. We had the choice to wait for another pair or wait for them to get better. We decided to wait it out and within a few months we were ready to go again. Mike admitted that he didnapost really have time to think about undergoing the operation to remove his kidney. My we was at Bristol Children’s hospital with Harry and I was at the Heath in Cardf. I was just so happy to be able to do something to help save Harry. All donations are anonymous and the only information accessible to recipients and donors is the gender, age, and location of their counterpart. Mike said: We wrote a letter to both our donor and my recipient and at the time didnapost know that they were husband and we.

Prefabs - or prefabricated houses - were erected across the UK after the Second World War to tackle the country’s housing shortage. They could now be the answer to Britain’s dementia crisis with numbers of sufferers expected to double in the next two decades. The concept was the brainchild of the founder of Swedish furniture giant Ikea, Ing Kamprad, before his death. Billionaire Mr Kamprad hoped to allow dementia patients and their carers to remain living at home for longer and made a donation to a Swedish dementia charity. The charity approached prefab building firm BoKlok to develop the apartments which have automatic doors and wide entrances to accommodate a wheelchair. They are built around park-like communal gardens for picnics and barbecues. Should one of the residents have dementia diagnosed, the flat can be easily upgraded with a host of special features such as adjustable wash basins, knobs and heat sensors on the ovens, and an alarm button in the bathroom. BoKlok is holding talks with the local authorities in Bristol and Swindon over building its standard prefabs and its dementia-friendly apartments could follow. In Sweden the number of people aged  or over will increase by  per cent from  to ,” Jonas Spangenberg, the chief executive of BoKlok. Society needs to find a solution where more people can stay at home for longer, and actually people want to stay in their own home. This is also much cheaper for everybody. There are currently around , people with dementia in the UK. This is projected to rise to . million by .  Two thirds of the cost of dementia is paid by people with dementia and their families. Unpaid carers supporting someone with dementia save the UK economy £. billion a year. The prefab flats are built in a factory then dropped in to place on a building site for assembly. This meaning they are a quick way to increase appropriate housing stock for the UK’s ageing population.

A spokesman for Radstock Hotel has apologised to Mrs Dodd - but says there is a member of staff on site at all times. Mrs Dodd stayed at the Radstock Hotel while she was visiting family in the area but has been upset by the experience. I am lost for words. I just sit and cry, she said. I had planned this super two night break in a hotel for Christmas and it was a nightmare. I would have been better off here in my little flat home alone. Radstock Hotel, you have made this elderly, sick lady very sad this year. Mrs Dodd says she got to the hotel at pm on Christmas Eve. She said: My daughteraposs partner went into the lounge bar to book me in and get my room keys, but it took half an hour before I got them as no one was there except the barman, who was lovely, but he was the only one there serving a pub full of people. Eventually he called someone who let me into my room, but there was no loo roll, and just two milks for my coffee to last for two nights. So, after the Christmas Eve karaoke finished, the downstairs rooms went quiet and I went off to sleep. The grandmother says she got up on Christmas Day morning and ventured downstairs at around am for breakfast. She said: I went in through the lounge bar which was in darkness, and so followed on through to the dining end, which was also in darkness and was absolutely littered with all the junk and rubbish from the night before. So I ambled back through the bar to be met by two young kitchen workers who had just come in and who were shocked to see me standing there. aposBreakfastapos, I asked. They looked at me cockled. They didnapost even know anyone was staying, let alone booked in and paid for breakfast. Apparently I was the only one in the whole building for the whole night alone. aposSo where is the managerapos I asked, aposlives in a cottage around the backapos, they said.  Mrs Dodd added: How scary it was that to think I was in that hotel alone all night and what a brilliant way to start my Christmas day. The boys were brilliant and made me egg on toast. Just so I could take my  medicines that I need to keep me going each day. I am almost , and have had three small strokes, which led to me having Parkinsonaposs. I also have Fibromyalgia and diabetes, yet I was alone in that hotel for the night. After a lovely day with her daughter and grandchildren, the family ed to the hotel at pm.  Mrs Dodd said: They stayed and had a drink, and then we chatted to the bar lady, explaining the night before, and checking what was happening about breakfast in the morning, and she apologised about earlier and said there would definitely be breakfast in the morning and that there were nine other guests staying the night. So off I went to bed, happily knowing I was not going to be alone in that hotel. The next morning I came down at .am, followed by four other guests, but this morning the door to the lounge bar was locked. No staff in, no breakfast, and all in darkness. The only door that opened was the door to go outside. The other guests were fuming, as, like me, they had booked for breakfast too.

The teen took a £ MDMA or ecstasy tablet but was unaware it was made up of % rat poison.Now his mum has today told Irish Mirror she feared her son was going to die.But Odi pulled through in hospital and is now back at school part time. Mum Grainne and her husband Alan, from Dundalk, Co Louth, were celebrating a friend’s wedding in London when the call of every parent’s nightmare came through. Just before the first dance, we got a call to say Odi was in the Belfast Mater Hospital in resuscitation and to call them immediately, said the mum-of-three. Seemingly Odi had got himself to a paramedic at the concert and told them he didn’t feel well, that he was a type one diabetic and had taken insulin fteen minutes beforehand. Within three minutes, he started seizing and convulsing. His temperature was  degrees and despite packing him in ice, it remained at  degrees for  hours. We couldn’t get a flight home from London until the next morning so I was in hysterics at the airport all night while Alan was pacing the floors waiting for our hourly updates from the hospital which always told us that Odi wasn’t likely to see the next hour and we probably wouldn’t make it back in time. My -year-old mother Josephine had travelled to the hospital but they wouldn’t let her into intensive care because he was that critically ill.  When they finally reached the hospital the following morning in June, Odi had gone into multi-organ failure. He was hooked up to so many machines which were the only things keeping him alive. He had nothing. No bowels, no kidneys, no liver, no lungs, no heart and no brain. There was no activity. It was our worst nightmare. At the time we didn’t know what had happened but later we found out that Odi had either been given or had taken MDMA at the concert and it took  hours for toxicology to show that it contained % rat poison so our son didn’t stand a hope in hell of making it. Odi was unable to transfer to King’s Hospital in London due to fears he wouldnapost survive the flight. But he was instead brought to St Vincent’s Hospital in Dublin - a centre for excellence for the liver - as medics thoughtthey could just get that vital organ working again, the rest might follow.  Grainne said: There was a vigil for Odi in Dundalk that night and we were watching it on social media. Just as it finished, doctors told us that he was being transferred to Dublin and at that moment, I felt I received my miracle. For  days, Odi was given just a % chance of survival but on the th day, he opened his eyes. He tried to say something and just his expression told me that I had Odi back. However he suffered another setback when diagnosed with an auto-immune disease and the family were further hit by tragedy with the death of Odie’s grandmother Josephine on August . I was on bended knee praying for a miracle for months and I received it but as well, God took the backbone of my family instead.” Odi is still going to rehabilitation and is without the use of his left arm and short term memory, which is why he has been unable to tell Grainne what happened at the concert. I did ask him about what happened that night but he had cerebral oedema and has very little memory. We might never know.

Supporters flooded a GoFundMe page with donations to pay for the -year-old’s appeal after she vowed to fight to clear her name.

But in the  hours after the verdict it passed £, as thousands of people made donations. In a post on the site her parents wrote: “Thank you all so much for your continuing support. “We are absolutely astounded by the donations we have received over the Christmas period and in the last few hours.

TV news presenters Hannah and Lewis Vaughan Jones spent years battling with infertility. But just before Christmas the pair announced the arrival of Matheson Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones - or Sonny for short - who they described as perfect in every way.Weaposve been through many years of heartache, but weaposve got the best Christmas present at the end of it all, said CNN news anchor Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny on December , Wales Online reports.We have been very public about it for the past three years or so, but in the years before that it was very private and painful - and there was a lot of shame involved which anyone going through infertility will be familiar with. But we have been lucky. We are the very, very lucky ones. Lewis, originally from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was harrowing watching his we going through round after round of IVF which involved frequent injections and hormone treatment. We wanted a family, but frankly we didnapost think it was going to happen for us, said Lewis, a freelance news presenter for BBC News and ITV News. In fact, I think weaposd already emotionally moved on. We said to each other that this was going to be our last round [of IVF]. And it was the last little embryo that we had left. Weaposd sent it off for testing and the results came back inconclusive, so we didnapost think it was going to work at all.  But weaposd come this far, so we made the decision to put the embryo back in and, unbelievably, it grew to become Sonny. The couple, who live in Twickenham, said they spent around £, on private IVF treatment after being given one round for free with the NHS. They said the odds of having a baby were severely stacked against them. Weaposd been through so much disappointment and we were emotionally ready to move forward with our lives, said Hannah, . But when the pregnancy test came up as positive I really couldnapost believe it. We didnapost allow ourselves to get too excited in the first  weeks or so until weaposd had the viability scans.  There was huge, huge relief when they said the growth and development was fine. Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny via c-section weighing exactly lb, said there were a few dficult moments during his first few days of le. He lost a lot of weight in the first week which we panicked about. We already thought we were terrible parents and didnapost know how to keep this little human being alive. But heaposs now finally caught up to his birth weight.

The right notes Labour contenders hoping to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as party leader are falling over themselves to be patriotic. This illustrates how much they recognise the party suffered from a perception the outgoing leader didn’t believe in his country. Corbyn insisted during the campaign that he did, but poison spread by his enemies had turned too many voters against him. Rivals for a tarnished Labour crown are echoing Tony Blair and Gordon Brown who, in the party’s successful era, constantly wrapped themselves in the flag. Loudly declaring in today’s Daily Mirror that they sing God Save the Queen is a chorus of politicians serious about winning elections.

Last December Becky Dell was inspired by the David Attenborough show Blue Planet to do her bit to help the environment. The Londoner decided to only buy food, drink and basic toiletries in .Writing on Twitter Becky said she watched, with shame plastic floating in the oceans and wondered how much was hers.So, aside from mascara and moisturiser, Becky did not buy anything she didnapost need. That meant no clothes, shoes, presents, other makeup, hair products, jewellery, bags, decorations, anything disposable, plants, flowers, house items etc. And the money that she saved from not splashing out would be given to a selection of charities and grassroots organisations. Becky says she ended up saving and donating £,.. But there were times when emergencies meant she had to buy something. On Twitter she said: I bought  things during the year, for example, a new jacket when my zip broke at - up a mountain, brr, a couple of essential things for my very elderly cats and a couple of essential house items. Each one made me really annoyed! And friends and family understood her challenge and supported Beckyaposs decision, with the thrty musical director making presents herself instead. And there were some things she really missed. Becky wrote: The thing I missed the most was buying plants and flowers, I love nature and found that hard. Solutions were growing flowers from seedand getting cuttings from friends . I now have rhubarb growing!!  At first, she said, it was quite easy: January to August was surprisingly easybut it got WAY hard from August, as clothes started running out and however much I darned my socks they just stayed holey. It got easier in December as I could start counting down. After  months of austere living the first thing Becky plans on splashing out on is socks, plants, some nice tea towels and a tea strainer.

During all the drama itaposs understandable that you might have missed out on or forgotten about some of the smaller, more amusing moments that have taken place. So, on the final day of the decade, as we prepare to welcome a new year, why not spare a few moments to remind yourself of what a year it really has been. Hereaposs a look back at some of the weird and wonderful stories that came out of  - including the bridezilla to end all bridezillas, magic freckles, bum sunning and gross gender reveals. What was your favourite story of the year  Be sure to let us know in the comments below. The apostruthapos about Corn Flakes Now, Corn Flakes certainly werenapost a new invention this year, but back in August many people discovered something shocking about the breakfast cereal for the very first time.In a book by Kate Devlin, called Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots, it was claimed that the cereal was created as an anti-masturbatory morning meal. This little tidbit did the rounds on social media, astounding many, but was later thrown out by online fact-checking resource Snopes who did some digging into John Kellogg.In a post on their site, they explained: According to the available evidence, Corn Flakes were primary created as an easy-to-digest, pre-prepared and healthy breakfast food, in particular for patients at the Kellogg sanitarium in Michigan. The product was never advertised as an aposanti-masturbatory morning mealapos.[The phrase] originated instead with a  article by Mental Floss, which reported   that aposKellogg developed a few dferent flaked grain breakfast cereals — including corn flakes — as healthy, ready-to-eat anti-masturbatory morning meals.aposYouTuber apospranksapos followers by kissing his sister This year we also discovered that there really is very little in le that a social media star wonapost share with their followers - including their lip locking antics.Chris Monroe, a YouTuber known as PrankInvasion, caused a stir back in April after uploading a video of himself kissing a woman he claims is his half sister. Viewers were left unsettled by the video, which was titled aposKISSING MY ACTUAL SISTER PRANKapos. In the clip, Chris challenges his sister, a woman named Kaitlyn OaposConnor, to play a game with him andshe loses, she has to kiss him. She lose and the pair make out in a bedroom - and they kiss not just once, but three times.To make matters worse, Chris later recreated the prank in a second video in which he kisses a woman he says is his mother. Understandably people were repulsed by the whole thing, with one person commenting: I feel like I gotta turn myself into the police for watching this. Another wrote: This is gross man. Hell is wrong with yaposall   Woman baffles with her aposbum sunningapos ritualNovember saw social media users left lost for words after an Instagram influencer named Meagan shared a post about the little-known practice of aposperineum sunningapos. Meagan uploaded a rather x-rated photo of herself laying flat on her back in the great outdoors, holding her legs in the air in order to get some rays on an area where, according to the popular saying, the sun usually doesnapost shine. The Calornia resident claims she exposes her perineum to the sun for five minutes every morning and it gives her energy - so much so that sheaposs been able to ditch coffee for good. She added that just  seconds of the ritual is the equivalent of a full day of sunlight with your clothes on and that it should be done between am and am for best results. Many people were intrigued by the wellness trend, including Avengers star Josh Brolin, who decided to give it a go for himself. However things didnapost quite go to plan for the actor, who says he suffered nasty sun burns on his pucker hole afterwards. He said: Tried this perineum sunning that Iaposve been hearing about and my suggestion is DO NOT do it as long as I did. My pucker hole is crazy burned and I was going to spend the day shopping with my family and instead Iaposm icing and using aloe and burn creams because of the severity of the pain. I donapost know who the f*** thought of this stupid s*** but f*** you nonetheless. Seriously. Bride cancels wedding after pals donate £k - but keeps all the money There were plenty of bridezilla stories to keep us going this year, but one of the most riveting involved a couple named Pam and Edward.The pair had planned an extremely lavish wedding and had borrowed money from friends and family to pay for it all.Theyaposd managed to raise £, in donations for the big day, but just as it neared, they decided to call the whole thing off and keep all the money for themselves.Pam revealed all in a viral post on Facebook : After much reflection and tear-filled conversation with our closest family members, we have decided to cancel our upcoming winter wedding.We thank each and every one of your for your generous donations to our money fund. Can you believe we have raised over ,    Unbelievable!!! Donapost worry, the money youaposve donated will not be spent in vain but rather used towards a honeymoon in the coming months. She added: After a honeymoon we will announce a new wedding date and re-open our money fund for any further gts! Weddings are expensive. Please stay tuned! In the meantime, Iaposll be updating our gt fund registry on Amazonanyone would like to gt us something to take on a honeymoon. Understandably, the wedding guests on Facebook were furious to find out they wouldnapost be getting their money back - and some threatened to take legal action against the couple. Pam wasnapost bothered though and hit back by reminding them that itaposs no longer their money as thataposs not how donations work. She later shared an update revealing how much stress she was under and saying she was going to take a week off to recover. And the icing on the cake came when she demanded her nearest and dearest to donate any spa or personal care items to her homethey cared about her wellbeing. Some people never change!  Disturbing food secrets As well as the Corn Flakes discovery, weaposve also learned a lot of little-known facts about other popular foods during .For instance, it came to light in October that bakeries have been keeping a big secret from us all - to do with doughnuts.Andrew Badcock, the general manager of Donut King, which has a branch in Essex, revealed that some food brands donapost use real jam in their jam doughnuts. Instead they fill the doughy treats with apple paste or sauce that has been coloured. This is because it has a natural sweetness but itaposs completely smooth - unlike raspberry jam which contains pips.If that werenapost enough, we also learned that fish and chip shops often donapost actually serve real vinegar , Spaghetti Bolognese is fake newsand that your morning coffee could contain ground-up cockroaches. Grossest ever gender revealA comedian left the internet feeling pretty grossed out after making a parody video of the popular baby trend.Paige Ginn, who is known for making videos of herself aposfake falling over in publicapos, used a bodilyto inform viewers of baby news. In the clip, she lies on the floor half naked and can be seen concentrating intensely for a few seconds, before releasing a fart and a cloud of blue smoke along with it.The video amassed millions of views on Facebook and was also shared on Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.Ginn captioned the footage gender reveal, later adding that all future gender reveals are cancelled. It is not clear whether she, or anyone  in the video was actually pregnant.  Women warned against inserting ice lollies into their vagina - and garlic, bath bombs, parsley, melted chocolate, etc Now, youaposd think this would be basic common sense, but  saw doctors repeatedly remind women not to insert foreign objects into their vagina.From garlic, to ice lollies medical experts were forced to issue warnings after women tried some rather surprising and dangerous things at home, including attempting to vacuum their period. Dr Sarah Welsh, the co-founder of HANX condom brand, explained why it was important to keep these items away from the female genitals. She said: The vagina is composed of very delicate and sensitive skin, hence things that may seem innocent to other areas of the body,they come in contact with the vagina, can cause infections, irritations and damage. Four-year-old claims heaposs aposthe reincarnation of Princess DianaaposKids say the funniest things, but one young boy has been telling his  parents  something rather unsettling. According to Australian TV presenter David Campbell, his four-year-old son Billy thinks he is the reincarnation of the late  Princess Diana  - and he claims to remember details from her le. The -year-old parent-of-three recalled that his youngest son first started talking about the famous royal at the age of just two, with the toddler pointing to an image of her on a card and exclaiming, Look, itaposs me when I was a princess.Despite not having been taught anything about the  royals,  Billyaposs strange comments continued and included one incident where he told his family about having a brother named Johnand another where he mentioned his two aposboysapos - i.e.  William  and  Harry. He started to refer to his two aposboysapos, recalls David. When asked what boys, our then three-year-old would say his apossonsapos. Ok... strange, but sure, mate. Andthat werenapost enough, the youngster also managed to accurately describe what Balmoral, the Queenaposs favourite residence, looked like - without ever having seen it for himself. The boyaposs most recent comment is perhaps the most shocking of all though - as he appears to discuss Dianaaposs passing. Lisa showed him another photo of Diana, adds David. aposBilly said: aposThereaposs me as a princess. Then one day the sirens came and I wasnapost a princess anymore.apos  Man dates cockroach called Lisa for a year  - before eating herEarlier this year a man confessed to dating a cockroach he called Lisa  for an entire year.Yuma Shinohara described the insect as his first love and said he fantasised about having sex with her. He also said that no human girl was as hot as Lisa and that they were  percent serious about each other... or at least they were until Lisa died and Yuma ate her. The -year-old from Japan is an entomophagist, which means he advocates eating bugs instead of meat, so felt it was only natural for him to eat his companion. Afterwards, he said: Now Lisa lives in my heart and continues living as part of my body.

Nor did we think it right to decide the pairing on our own.So, as you’ll see, we’ve asked three of our trusted pundits to each pick their own engine room pairing.The Dons of the Decade team is lined up in a --- and, without further ado, here is the side picked by you and our experts: vw, px\"  JOE LEWIS: The current Aberdeen captain is widely considered the most reliable goalie at Pittodrie since Jim Leighton and amassed more than % of the vote.SHAY LOGAN: A mainstay of Derek McInnes’ team since arriving, initially on loan from Brentford, in .With more than  club appearances, he won the right-back poll easily.RUSSELL ANDERSON: At last count, former skipper and  League Cup winner Anderson, who ed to Pittodrie for a second spell in the s, was more than , votes up in the right-sided centre-half poll.SCOTT McKENNA: Next to Anderson is the -year-old Scotland international, who amassed around % of the vote to Mark Reynolds’ %.McKenna has been the subject of several multi-million-pound bids since breaking through.ANDY CONSIDINE: Another legend of the club, with more than  appearances, left-back Considine was never under threat when the readers cast their votes, with his name selected hundreds of times more than nearest rival Max Lowe.CENTRAL-MIDFIELD TWO: Our pundits, Dons icons Joe Harper and Willie Miller, and Scotland women’s captain Rachel Corsie, only selected three names between them however, by majority, the pairing of now-club coach Barry Robson and former skipper Graeme Shinnie was preferred to the Ryan Jack-Shinnie pairing.NIALL McGINN: Right winger McGinn has had two spells at the Dons this decade, with a brief stint in South Korea in between.Another League Cup winner, he continues to be a dference-maker in McInnes’ team and had more than % in the poll.KENNY McLEAN: Now at English Premier League outfit Norwich City, McLean could have easily been in at centre-midfield too.At number , the creative McLean was able to cut through stubborn defences and link midfield to attack with his passing ability.JONNY HAYES: Another one of the eight League Cup winners named by the readers or our pundits, Hayes was quick, technically gted and energetic on the left-flank. His poll win was bigger than McGinn’s.The Irishman played in three domestic cup finals in red, winning one, and also had a habit of grabbing big goals.ADAM ROONEY: Centre-forward Rooney was Aberdeen’s most reliable season-after-season scorer since Harper.

He played  minutes against Livingstonwhen we only planned to play Niall for  minutes.“Niall did not have  minutes in him against Hearts but thank God we had him to call upon.“He has been doing that for years for us now, turning up when the game is screaming for a bit of quality. When we were screaming out for that quality, calmness and decision making Niall was there, as he normally is.”McGinn’s superb -yard free kick came immediately after Hearts had been reduced to  men.Sean Clare received a straight red for pulling back Jon Gallagher as the on-loan Atlanta United attacker broke in on goal.McGinn’s equaliser was the only moment of real attacking quality from Aberdeen. McInnes started with two strikers, Bruce Anderson and Curtis Main.McInnes said: “At half time we spoke with a bit of honesty about how we were not passing the ball well enough or showing enough of ourselves.“We were better when we went back to a more familiar shape with one up when Bruce went up on his own.“In the last  minutes of the game we were devoid of quality, calmness and the right decision making.“We all became a bit too rushed in what we were doing in sailing it forward and not moving the ball quick enough at times.“It was in these moments that we had to show a bit more experience, control and composure to get to their goal and get a winner.“Unfortunately we didn’t do enough to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

SNH staff, who are part of west coast community planning partnerships, have been helping local partners understand how to make the most of natural habitats which have the greatest capacity to absorb and lock up carbon emissions.Argyll and Bute has large areas of peatland and a huge area of woodland which is actively locking in carbon. The seas surrounding the islands of Argyll provide a #blue carbon# facility to absorb carbon dioxide, thanks to the action of marine algae.In  there was a lot of interest in the Sea Eagle Management Scheme, including from areas which sea eagles have recently moved into. The scheme is designed to support crofters and farmers to mitigate the impacts that sea eagles can have on sheep flock. SNH and its partners have been developing some new approaches on trial farms and plan to roll out some of the techniques that may reduce impacts on sheep flocks. For updates on the scheme see www.nature.scotNow in its th year, the Snapberry project uses photography to connect students with the astonishing natural landscape of Taynish nature reserve. It is a collaboration between SNH and Lochgilphead High School, with digital imagery allowing participants to express what they see and feel about their environment.Through the years, the groups have always been mixed ability groups however  was the first year the whole group of pupils who took part in the Snapberry Project all had additional support needs. Organisers have seen remarkable responses from these pupils in previous years, when they get out of the classroom and into nature. One year, a boy whose responses were fairly limited in school, interacted with his peers in a way never before seen by the teachers. Some pupils have also discovered a natural talent for photography that they never knew they had.As part of a parliamentary event celebrating the national nature reserves, the Snapberry Project was chosen to highlight the work done at Taynish and how SNH connect people, especially young people, with nature.Some of the young people who took part in the project in  were invited, along with two of their teachers and a parent helper, to attend the event. This was no mean feat when their additional needs are considered, however, although challenging at times, the pupils enjoyed their visit. They met two senior MSPs, Mike Russell, a long-time supporter of Snapberry, and Brian Whittle and they even got a tour of the chamber where they were allowed to sit in the First Minister#s chair.

There has been too much focus on polarisation and not enough time delivering for the electorate. It is the season of goodwill.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca

huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

But typical of the Scot who received a Mercury Prize nomination for his debut album Architect, it remains sounding like nothing  around, with signature layered harmonies and a gorgeous hooksome middle eight.ldquoTalk Talk Talk is about miscommunication.

McGowan was just one of those many women who stepped forward to make accusations about Harvey Weinstein that year. She was there at the beginning of a series or revelations about the producer which would snowball into a global sharing of stories of womens experience of sexual assault and harassment that would be called #MeToo.If anyone became a figurehead, it was McGowan. She may not have come up with the term Me Too ndash that was Tarana Burke back in . Nor was she the person to put the hashtag out into the ocean of social media ndash that was Alyssa Milano, her co-star from Charmed. But she made her mark as someone who would not be silenced. She has also claimed that she was the first person to out Weinstein.#MeToo was a cultural revolution and catharsis. Back in , when it broke, it felt asHollywood and the many fields where men were protected by their power and influence would never be the same again. In this revolution around what women should tolerate, who would be listened to, and what should be shamed, McGowan stood out. She wrote a memoir, Brave. She used her anger as a weapon. In an interview with the Times, she asked, \"Who has been more effective  hellip Playing nice for women hasnt got us very far.\"Weinstein recently complained that he was \"a forgotten man\". With his trial coming up next month ndash five charges, including two counts of rape ndash he might wish he were more forgotten than he is. #MeToo might have experienced backlash and criticism. But out of it did come much that was positive and inspirational, particularly the courage of the women who came forward. McGowan embodies that. Her voice carried the message that the time when abusers could expect silence was over.VICKY ALLANPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, ACTOR, WRITER AND PRODUCERSpeaking to The Herald recently, Scottish actress Ellie Haddington recalled her time working on The Cafe, a Sky One sitcom which aired in . It starred The Royle Familys Ralf Little alongside Haddington and Littles co-writer Michelle Terry. But it was another cast member, then an unknown -year-old actress, who particularly caught Haddingtons eye. \"I can remember looking at her,\" she said, \"and thinking: My God, what an extraordinary inidual.\" The inidual in question was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her first major role.Fast forward eight years and the London-born polymath has the world at her feet, particularly the part that houses the gilded constituencies that hand out Emmys and Golden Globes. The  Golden Globe ceremony is on January  in Beverly Hills and Waller-Bridge is up for two awards. Ten days later shell be honoured at the Screen Actors Guild Awards where shes nominated in two categories. Andshe flies home laden with mantelpiece accessories it wont be the first time ndash she scooped three Golden Globes at last years award as well as three Primetime Emmys.If not, well theres the not insignicant matter of the th James Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April. Waller-Bridge co-wrote the script and great things are expected. Of coursetheres one production on which Waller-Bridges name is indelibly stamped its Fleabag, written by and starring her as a young Londoner navigating family, work, sex and relationships with brutal honesty and unsettling humour.Starting out as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Fringe, it was turned into a TV series in  but was dropped quietly onto BBC Three, then only available online. But word-of-mouth is still a powerful tool even in our digital age and by the summer it had been relaunched on BBC Four. The rest is television history: when we look back at this decades television, well be splitting it into pre and post-Fleabag.Even more interestingly, Waller-Bridge followed that triumph with one of the career curve-balls weve now come to expect: an adaptation of Luke Jenningss Villanelle spy novel series. Retitled Killing Eve it was fresh, funny, thrillingly violent and gratuitously fashion-forward, and made a star of lead actress Jodie Comer, whose pink Molly Godard tulle dress became the go-to Halloween costume for hipsters everywhere. And, of course, it hauled in yet more gongs for its writer.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesWill it be third time lucky with No Time to Die  Dont ever bet against Phoebe Waller-Bridge.BARRY DIDCOCKANDY MURRAY, TENNIS PLAYERSmall, wet, overweight countries should not ndash and usually do not ndash produce tennis superstars. As only those from other small countries can appreciate ndash the Jamaicans and Swiss, perhaps ndash possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller.Thats exactly what Andy Murray has done for Scotland . Is there any feeling comparable to the buzz of watching Murray play a big match, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body  I think not.And yet the Dunblane-born champion is not only from Scotland, but very much of his homeland. During the late Noughties, the young, gangly, wild-haired Murray thrilled us with his impressive Wimbledon runs. But as the years went on and he just missed out on a slew of grand slam trophies, many English media outlets and tennis fans took against him, decrying the sweary intensity and dry Scottish banter. This only made Scots love him more, of course.Eventually, with patience, maturity, courage and sheer hard graft came the top honours in tennis ndash the US Open, two Wimbledon singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup, the coveted world number one spot ndash and global adulation.But as much as he grew as a sportsman, whats equally remarkable about Murray is how he grew as person. Indeed, it is his openness, humanity and humility, the way he speaks out against sexism in tennis, that make him a true hero, loved by his peers and the public, rather than simply respected.A devastating hip injury ndash and subsequent resurfacing operation ndash nearly ended Murrays career, and his recent comeback has been both painful and inspiring to watch.Murray taught Scots to dream big. But the father of three also taught Scots men, in particular, showing your feelings, being true to yourself, makes you a bigger man in every way.MARIANNE TAYLORJEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEOThe worlds richest man is fond of reminding people that he started Amazon in his garage. A company that is now worth more than pound trillion and employs in the region of , people began with Bezos packing books and taking them to the post office himself.Like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and Twitters Jack Dorsey, Bezos grasped early on the potential of the internet. That realisation has had huge consequences. Amazon has transformed shopping, helped hollow out the high street, and led to a fortune for its creator estimated at poundbn.That has allowed him to set up his own space exploration company and buy the Washington Post .Bezoss success cant be gainsayed, but at what cost  Employees have bitterly complained about working conditions, the EU is investigating the company for anti-trust violations and earlier this year it had to scrap plans to build a second headquarters in New York when local politicians questioned why a company making bna month should receive taxpayers cash to move to the city.Oh yes, and it was also revealed that the company had not paid any income tax in the US the previous year. Or the year before that. You dont get to be the richest man in the world by giving anything away, obviously.TEDDY JAMIESONDAVID BOWIE, MUSICIANIn the months after his death at the start of , as Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, there was a spate of tweets wonderingBowies absence was now one of the reasons why everything was going to hell in a handcart.\"Im not saying that David Bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but *gestures broadly at everything*\" tweeted blogger Katie Liewy with tongue firmly in cheek in June that year.Whether his influence actually stretched that far, theres no doubt that culturally this decade was Bowies, in the same way as the s belonged to the Beatles. As Oasis looked to Lennon and McCartney in the mid-s, Bowie became the touchstone for any musician ndash from FKA Twigs to St Vincent ndash in the s who wanted to push the odd boundary.But none of them did it as well as the original, who ed at the start of , after almost a decade in which he had withdrawn from public view. He released a new single, Where Are We Now , on his birthday without any warning. It presaged a new album, The Next Day, and a VA retrospective, David Bowie Is. Three years later he released an album, Blackstar, on his th birthday. Two days later his death was announced. It was ashe was curating his own end.:From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicFor anyone who knew him in the middle of the s the fact that Bowie avoided being a rock n roll casualty must have seemed a miracle given his copious drug intake back then.Instead, he weaned himself off them, created some of the most memorable and potent music of the late th century, reinvented himself as a mainstream pop star in the s, then became an elder statesman who embraced everything from drum n bass to the internet before his final st-century flourish.His is one of the great stories in pop and in  it came to a tragic yet magnicent conclusion.TEDDY JAMIESONELON MUSK, TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURThe chronicles of self-styled maverick billionaire Elon Musk never fail to fascinate. Among his outlandish adventures and madcap musings, we have Elon and the space car Elon and the Thai cave rescue Elon and the dead gorilla novelty rap Elon and his plan to nuke Mars.South African-born Musk first pricked the public consciousness as a technology entrepreneur, investor and engineer in  when, aged , he sold his web software company, Zip, to Compaq for  million .He continued to ascend his field throughout the Noughties, but it is in the last decade that Musk has become a household name for his roles as founder chief engineer designer of SpaceX and the CEO product architect at Tesla.Granted, this is often more down to calamity than plaudits for his innovative work. Such as the cringe-inducing moment during a recent unveiling for the new Tesla Cybertruck when, demonstrating how tough the \"armour glass\" of the windows was to break, they were duly smashed.Or when he referred to British er Vernon Unsworth ndash who helped rescue  Thai boys trapped in a flooded underwater cave in  ndash as \"pedo guy\" on Twitter .Then theres Musks lofty plans to \"nuke Mars\" ndash which he describes as \"a fixer upper of a planet\" ndash suggesting that nuclear bombs should be detonated at its poles to melt the ice caps and allow it to sufficiently heat up for humans to dwell there.And the head-scratching moment when he dropped a track on SoundCloud called RIP Harambe, a heavily auto-tuned song about the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla whose death in  sparked a global outpouring of grief and anger.Sure, Musk sometimes loses credibility due to his more leftfield thinking ndash such as a belief that were all probably living in a giant computer simulation like The Matrix or a Sims-style game controlled by superior beings ndash but there is no denying that hes a clever guy who shouldnt be underestimated.If this is a simulation, we cant wait to see what our overlords get him to do next.SUSAN SWARBRICKMEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEXSurely it wasnt meant to be like this. If you become a fairy tale princess can you not then expect to live happily ever after That hasnt been the case for Meghan Markle. Yes, she had the royal wedding last year attended by the great and the good and the merely famous. Yes, she got a title, a handsome prince and a royal baby . Not what she must have expected growing up a mixed-race kid in Los Angeles.And yet since the wedding there has found herself a constant target of the tabloid press. She recently filed a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her estranged father. It also prompted her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to condemn the medias \"relentless propaganda\" which was, he said, often \"knowingly  and malicious\" in a public statement announcing the legal action.His anger is perhaps understandable given the paparazzis involvement in the death of his mother. \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he admitted this year.The Duchess of Sussexs major crime would appear to be that she has \"opinions\". There is a class of media commentator ndash mouthy, reactionary and perhaps most importantly white ndash who is offended by her feminism and likes to moan about the couples \"wokeness\". It has prompted \"the Queen\", or, rather, the TV version of the monarch, Olivia Colman, star of The Crown, to speak out against the critics.:From Leonard Bernsteinrsquos MASS to the GRIT Orchestra, Keith Bruces musical picks of the decade\"I dont know why theyre so mean to a fellow human being,\" Coleman said of the press coverage.Or maybe we simply have to accept there is no such thing as happy ever after.TEDDY JAMIESONGRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER\"My name is Greta,\" a Swedish schoolgirl wrote on her flyers in . \"I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate. Since you adults dont give a damn about my future, I wont either.\"Its hard to believe that it has only been just over a year since Thunberg ndash recognised now simply as \"Greta\" to millions ndash made her viral UN speech in Poland, saying, \"You say you love your children above all . And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\"Thunberg may only have made her stamp in the final year of the decade, but at just  years old she has done more to provoke an attitude sht on environment than anyone, and she began it by skipping school.Her words and actions have woken millions of schoolchildren, four million of whom went on strike from school on September , as well as adults, to the science-backed threat of the climate emergency. On what is arguably the biggest issue of our time, hers is the voice that has led, upbraiding those in leadership. Margaret Atwood called her the Joan of Arc of environmentalism. Donald Trump told her to \"chill\". Collins Dictionary made \"climate strike\" its word of the year.Why did people listen to her, when others saying the same were ignored  Perhaps because of who she was ndash not an adult, scientist, politician or expert ndash and how she, a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome, delivered her message, politely, yet angrily and without softenings.To the UN General Assembly, in September, she said: \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\" She has started a powerful movement. The question is whether necessary change will follow. Can we alter the ending of this terrying nightmare  Thunberg dares us to.VICKY ALLANNICOLA STURGEON, FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLANDBy the time Nicola Sturgeon became Scotlands first female First Minister in , at the age of , she had already been involved in politics for more than a quarter of a century.She joined the SNP in her native Ayrshire ndash then a Labour bastion ndash aged  at the height of the Thatcher years. It was the decisive first step on a journey that would transform not only the young Sturgeon but the fortunes of her party, and, ultimately, the political landscape in Scotland.After becoming an MSP in , Sturgeon, a solicitor by trade, impressed from the outset, serving in two shadow cabinets. In , she was elected deputy party leader to Alex Salmond during his second stint as party leader. The partnership was successful and in  the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, paving the way for s independence referendum.When Salmond resigned as SNP leader and First Minister in the aftermath of the Yes campaigns loss, Sturgeon was the obvious choice to replace him.:From Frozen to  Years a Slave, the best films of the last  yearsThe five years since have seen tumultuous change in UK politics, with Sturgeon growing in stature as politician and stateswoman, both in UK and European terms, even in the eyes of many who do not share her stance on independence. She regularly appears in glossy magazine lists of the worlds most influential women.During the recent General Election campaign her clear opposition to Brexit and impressive performances in TV debates ndash not to mention her lively Twitter feed ndash won her a whole new legion of fans in England, particularly among women. Will Sturgeon lead Scotland to independence in the s  That remains to be seen. Regardless, her place in Scottish history, as politician and role model, is guaranteed.MARIANNE TAYLORBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESThings might look dferent now. In , at the end of Barack Obamas second term in office, when commentators looked back at his legacy as president, there was a sense that his achievements were, at best, mixed.True, he had withdrawn US soldiers from Iraq, improved relations with Cuba, reached a nuclear deal with Iran and introduced Obamacare.Set against that, though, he escalated American military involvement in Afghanistan, increased drone strikes in Pakistan, saw wealth and income inequality rocket under his watch. Guantanamo Bay was still in operation when he left office and though he spoke out in favour of gun control he didnt manage to introduce it.Obama could point to Republican obstruction in the House of Congress. Even so there was a whf of missed opportunities about his presidency. Perhaps that was inevitable. In the end a centrist president was never going to live up to the utopian notions so many Americans projected on to him during the  election campaign.And yet, in retrospect, perhaps his achievements are growing. What has been missed over the last four years is his articulacy, eloquence, wit and normality.In part its because he represents the antithesis of what came after. An inarticulate, narcissistic, racist, corrupt old man whose first term has been a skip fire of the vanities ending in a vote for impeachment. Obama for all his failings always felt like he was an adult in the room. Can you say the same of Donald Trump TEDDY JAMIESONKIM KARDASHIAN WEST, REALITY TV STAR AND ENTREPRENEURLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Kim Kardashian West ripped up the rule book in her rise to becoming a world-famous reality star with a multi-million-dollar business empire and a global fanbase.Having first found peripheral fame as a friend and stylist to heiress Paris Hilton in the early s, Kardashian West gained notoriety after the release of her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J in . That same year, the familys reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, began airing.While the naysayers reckoned it would be a fleeting  minutes of fame, Kardashian West pulled off a shrewd and unparalleled move: she utilised social media to make herself into a brand. Today, her Midas touch extends across fashion, fragrances and cosmetics to television, books, gaming, and even law and politics. Oh, and she is queen of the selfie.An exaggerated hourglass figure and cartoonishly large backside have become a trademark for Kardashian West, garnering as many ndash and often more ndash column inches as her entrepreneurial ventures.: The best visual arts of the last  years, by Jan Patience and Sarah Urwin JonesIndeed, when Kardashian West posed for a  cover of Paper magazine with her rear bared and oiled up like a Greek wrestler, it saw a new phrase \"break the internet\" coined, referring to the frenzy that the images sparked.That same year, she joined her husband, the rapper Kanye West, for a landmark cover on Vogue magazine. \"There are a lot of firsts,\" Kardashian West said at the time. \"Kanyes the first rapper to be on, Im the first reality person to be on, were the first interracial couple.\"She continues to surprise people. Earlier this year, Kardashian West announced she was following in her late fathers footsteps by studying to become a lawyer .Kardashian West ndash who boasts  million social media followers on Instagram alone ndash seems determined to use her  and stratospheric public profilefor good, visiting US president Donald Trump at the Oval Office last year to discuss justice reform.She successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, a -year-old woman who spent  years in an Alabama prison, without parole, for a non-violent, first-time drug offence. Johnson was released in  and Kardashian West has vowed to tackle other miscarriage of justices.Her work to date makes for impressive reading. But in the scheme of things, one could argue that Kardashian West is only just getting started. With her husband having announced he intends to run for US president in , a decade from now this might all seem like small fry.SUSAN SWARBRICKSTORMZY, RAPPERWhy is Stormzy one of the most influential public figures of the last decade  There are  people you could ask ndash  black students who were admitted to Cambridge University in . Thats up about  per cent more than the  who started courses in .Not all of it is down to Stormzy, but a lot of it may be. In , the grime artist announced he would be paying the tuition fees and maintenance grants of two black Cambridge students, and this year he said hed be paying for two more. Its called the Stormzy Scholarship and now theyre calling the rise in the number of black students at Cambridge the Stormzy Effect.The question is: can the effect spread  Theres still a huge gap between the chances of going to university in the UKyoure white and well-off and the chances of goingyoure black or youre poor or youre both and some argue universities will have to offer places to poorer students with lower grades to start making a dference. But the good news, thanks to Stormzy, is that black students now make up more than three per cent of new undergrads at Cambridge for the first time.Stormzy has had another effect too, and perhaps its one that will be even more profound. Rappers have traditionally had a bit of an image problem: theyve usually promoted out-of-school activities rather than in-school ones. But Stormzys dferent. \"It sounds corny coming from a rapper,\" he says, \"but I did love learning and I loved studying.\" The Stormzy Effect could inspire many others to feel the same.MARK SMITHSIMONE BILES, GYMNASTOnce in a letime ndashyoure very lucky ndash theres a sporting star who shines so brightly that they eclipse everything that has come before.Step forward Simone Biles. The US gymnasts talent and achievements are such that we humble observers have long since exhausted the superlatives.While the gymternet ndash as the online community of gymnastics fans are known ndash has been abuzz about Biles for years, it was at the Rio  Olympic Games that the rest of the world sat up and took notice.: From Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour to What Girls Are Made of, five standout theatre shows of the decadeBiles, who won four golds and a bronze, found herself repeatedly compared to a raft of male sporting greats asthat is the only way we could comprehend her colossal achievements. \"Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,\" she responded. \"Im the first Simone Biles.\"The -year-old from Texas burst onto the global gymnastics scene in , winning her debut world all-around gold in Antwerp. It is a title that Biles has claimed on four further occasions , alongside a raft of inidual apparatus medals.In October, Biles took her th medal, making her the most decorated gymnast ndash male or female ndash in world championship history .But it is not only in a competition arena that Biles proved herself a gargantuan presence. In January , she released a statement on Twitter confirming that former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar was later sentenced to up to  years in prison after more than  women stood up in court and laid bare their own experiences of sexual abuse in a scandal spanning three decades.Biles and her fellow survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. At the  US National Championships, she designed and wore a teal leotard ndash a colour used to raise awareness about sexual abuse.A vocal critic of the US Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to the allegations against Nassar, Biles continues to lobby for better accountability from both governing bodies.She refuses to be defined by what happened. Biless willingness to push the boundaries of her sport remains unabated. At the  US Gymnastics Championships, she stepped out in a crystal-studded leotard bearing her surname above an embroidered image of a goats head.It was a nod to the acronym GOAT, which is shorthand for the Greatest of All Time. Far from being boastful, however, this was Biless tongue-in-cheek \"jab back\" at the \"haters\" .She has the goods to back it up. This year Biles had two gymnastics skills ndash a hugely dficult triple twisting-double somersault in her floor routine and double-double dismount from beam ndash named in her honour after she became the first woman to perform them. Both appear to defy gravity.The Tokyo  Olympic Games loom on the horizon. Simone Biles is far from done yet.SUSAN SWARBRICKABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIHe was the most wanted terrorist in the world. For more than half of the last decade, no single figure caused more chaos in the Middle East than Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. For that was his real name, even though the world came to know him by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the decade began al-Baghdadi had already served four years in the sprawling US military detention centre called Camp Bucca, which had detained some of the Iraq Wars most radical jihadists. In political and religious terms he was already a long way from his days as a PhD student of Islamic Studies at university in Baghdad.By , clad in black robes and standing in the pulpit of a mosque in Iraqs second city of Mosul, he was already claiming the title caliph of the Muslim world and leadership of the infamous Islamic Stategroup.Few even then could have imagined the chaos, carnage and suffering that al -Baghdadi, born one of six children in , would wreak on the world.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesIt would not be until October , , in a raid carried out by US Special Forces, when al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest in the Syrian province of Idlib, that the world was rid of his malign presence.\"We killed the last murderous bastard who ran IS, lets go get the next one,\" proclaimed one tough-talking US Republican Senator in the wake of al- Baghdadis death.But in the tunnels and booby traps left behind in cities like Mosul and Raqqa to the mass graves and thousands of faceless, black-clad female followers haunting refugee camps, ISs presence remains palpable along with its new new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.Many IS fighters now languish in prisons, but thousands more remain at large re-grouping and organising while their franchises likewise operate across the globe. This is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadis lingering and still menacing legacy.DAVID PRATT, CONTRIBUTING FOREIGN EDITORBOB SERVANT, BURGER TYCOONAh, Bob Servant. How do we love thee  Let us count the ways.

Half-baked publicity stunts coupled with glowing obituaries to tinpot dictators.Dundee-born Neil Forsyth is the man who breathed le into the incorrigible comic creation, first as a series of books, then a BBC Radio Scotland adaptation and latterly a BBC Four sitcom with Brian Cox in the titular role.Recent years have seen the Broughty Ferry burger don ndash who has been declared a \"national treasure\" ndash become a social media sensation, amassing a loyal Twitter following as he imparts inimitable pearls of wisdom as part of his frank and forthright narrative on le.As well as running Bobs Twitter account, Forsyth penned the hit BBC Scotland drama Guilt, which aired this autumn, and was given five stars by The Heralds TV critic Alison Rowat, who described it as \"the most impressive small screen debut since Tutti Frutti\".SUSAN SWARBRICKCAITLYN JENNER, TELEVISION PERSONALITY AND TRANSGENDER ACTIVISTFor gay people, the last  years have been the decade of change after a century of virtually none. Public opinion has become ever more supportive. LGBT people have become ever more visible. And in , gay marriage was made legal in most of the UK.Then theres the T in LGBT. A few days ago, the Scottish Government published a draft bill which will simply the process of trans men and women having their gender legally recognised, but its not been an easy path. Some feminists say the legislation will undermine the rights of women. Trans activists say a change in the law is the only way to end the demeaning legal and medical process trans people currently have to endure. The two sides have not always been nice to each other.What the debate, and the bitterness, may prove is there is still some distance to go to LGBT equality, but the fact we got closer in the last decade is in large part due to its trans pioneers and one pioneer in particular. You know what Im talking about andnot, you should: the cover of Vanity Fair in June . Caitlyn Jenner. Former Olympic athlete. Openly transgender woman.For Jenner, the photograph was an act of happiness. \"Im so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self,\" she said when the magazine was published. \"Welcome to the world Caitlyn.\" And for those who saw the picture, it was an act of courage and activism. When is equality  When trans people are in parliaments, and in churches, and in governments, and on the cover of fashion magazines.MARK SMITHDONALD TRUMP, BORIS JOHNSON, NIGEL FARAGE AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, POPULIST POLITICIANSVladimir Putin is about to mark  years in power ndash he first became Russian president on December ,  ndash and for much of that time the West has looked at his style ndash authoritarian, bombastic and a little bit silly ndash and thought: thank God were not like that.But that was then. First, a man with a fag in his mouth ndash call me Nigel ndash became leader of Ukip and the Brexit Party. Then a man with a phone in his hand ndash call me Donald ndash became president of the United States. And then a man with an inappropriate phrase on the tip of his tongue ndash call me Boris ndash became Prime Minister of the UK.Its not a coincidence they are known by their Christian names. Nigel, Donald and Boris represent a new, first-names-only style of politics that has dominated America and the UK in the last  years: populist, chummy, big on rhetoric, light on detail, and ndash much to the frustration of liberals ndash effective at attracting votes. Those three men have attracted support from working class voters who have traditionally looked to the left for answers. In the last  years, though, theyve looked right, and the result is Nigel, Donald and Boris.The next decade will decide their fate. Arguably, Farage has already been neutered after the Brexit Partys dismal election campaign. But the fates of Trump and Johnson are less certain. Trump has been impeached and will face a trial in the Senate, but its controlled by the Republicans, who arent going to vote their man out. As for Johnson, hes just won a big, blue majority and, failing a cock-uphes going to be here for the next five years.Beware:  years of populism may become .MARK SMITHPROFESSOR PETER HIGGS, SCIENTISTScience always plays the long game. It took almost a century for scientists in  to prove Einsteins  predictions of gravitational waves in space, which formed part of his theory of general relativity. Professor Peter Higgs didnt have to wait quite that long.Back in , while teaching at Edinburgh University, Higgs published papers predicting the existence of a particle that gave mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. It soon became known as the Higgs Boson. Much to his dismay, it was also called the God particle.No-one could find it, however. Or not until , when the large hadron collider near Geneva finally proved its existence.A year later Higgs, then , won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the prize with fellow scientist Francois Englert.Higgs decided to go on holiday when the prize was announced, neglecting to take his mobile phone with him in a bid to avoid being pestered by journalists. They could wait. He had, after all.TEDDY JAMIESONEL JAMES, AUTHORThere was a moment, in the summer of , where everywhere you looked someone had their nose in a copy Fty Shades of Grey. Its racy themes became the subject of countless water cooler chats, school run tete-a-tetes and whispered conversations over the garden fence.The erotic novel by EL James has been crowned bestselling book of the decade.

Neither do the lizards in India. But the Trigonopterus attenboroughi beetle and the Sitana attenboroughii lizard are named after an exceptional member of homo sapiens: Sir David Attenborough.

Im determined to kick the social media habit in the New Year. Not an easy task since I have to push my columns across social media as part of my work. I have , followers as well. Ive no idea who most of them are, or what they think, because theyre generally not the people who reply to my posts.The responses I get are often abusive taunts from angry Scottish nationalists claiming that Im paid by the ldquoYoon Herald to do down Scotland and the SNP. Many of the rest are from the sneery, jeery activist class of keyboard warriors who spend their time trawling Twitter for something to be offended by.Time was when you could have interesting discussions about politics, economics, art, films. But as politics has become polarised it is increasingly dficult to contain any discussion. It rapidly gets hijacked by agenda-driven interlopers who want to reduce everything to an ideological row. And yes, maybe Ive been guilty of that too.The fun has also drained out of Twitter as literalism has overwhelmed it. Jokes are now impossible unless they are in the style of: ldquoBoris Johnson is a cnut. RTyou agree. On social media you cant afford ambiguity, or irony. The title of this column, for example, would be taken to mean that I am a card-carrying supporter of Boris Johnson.On Twitter everything is black or white and there must under no circumstances be a hint of grey. Yet for all the virtue signalling and self-righteous moralising, the chief characteristic of Twitter remains toxic abuse. Women, Jews, ldquoTerfs and many besides find they are under constant attack from anonymous trolls.SoI find Twitter so problematic, why do I keep going back to it, like a dog to its own sick  Well, it is an invaluable news wire, for one. On general election night, for example, it allows you to be live at every count in Scotland.Twitter is nearly always first with the news, eventhe news is wrong. The BBCs political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, attracted a torrent of abuse during the election campaign when she tweeted that a Tory special adviser had been ldquopunched by Labour protesters outside Leeds General Infirmary. He hadnt. She corrected it immediately, but it has since gone down as proof positive of ldquoTory bias at the BBC .It is very easy to spread fake news on Twitter. During the election campaign, I retweeted a post which I thought had come from the BBC announcing that Ms Kuenssberg was going to interview Boris Johnson instead of Andrew Neil. Disgrace, I said. The BBC had caved in to the PM and given him a softer interviewer. I was mortied when I realised it was a fake.The BBC is now considering banning political journalists from Twitter because of the blowback. Its getting out of hand. Anyone connected with the hated ldquoMSM, short for mainstream media, is accused of compulsive lying, intellectual dishonesty, or pandering to the right.During the general election Labour and Remain activists more or less colonised Twitter, and turned the place into an inquisition. Anyone failing to agree that Boris Johnson is a lying crypto-fascist, financed by dark money, who beats his we was liable to be condemned by ldquopile on. That is the social media term for hyperbolic rubbishing by legions of hostile posts.On social media, the strength of an argument is irrelevant, all that matters is how often something is repeated. Confirmation bias is the bane of social media. Twitters legion of legal experts were certain that Boris Johnson could never get the EU Withdrawal Deal reopened last year ndash until he did.Most of us are now aware of ldquofilter bubbles ndash how social media curates your ldquofeed so that as time goes on you see only people with the same prejudices you have. Ive tried correcting this algorithmic brain washing, but without success. No matter how much I mute and unfollow I still see the same people making the same empty-headed condemnations of their political opponents. The same lame memes. The same dodgy statistics.As a result, Twitter has, for me, become a kind of anti-filter bubble. Instead of confirming me in my political beliefs, the constant exposure to hyper-partisan reflections of them has started to work in reverse. It is a kind of aversion therapy. A Remain-supporting lefty Yesser, I now bristle when I see Tory Brexiteers and Unionists being portrayed as racists and idiots.Before Christmas, the Conservative columnist Alex Massie unwisely tweeted that refusing to have friends who have dferent opinions to your own is as sign of small-mindedness. This provoked a tiny-minded torrent of jeering replies from people saying they couldnt possibly be friends with ldquoTory racists.Said one: ldquoIm not hanging around with people who would see me suffer at the hands of actual eugenicists in the Tory Party.\" Said another: ldquoI dont want friends that want children to starve to death so the rich can get richer.\"These people actually believe this. ldquoTory policies kill vulnerable people, that is an indisputable fact,\" said one, ldquovote Tory and you are complicit. Another said without a hint of self-awareness: ldquoI dont have anything to do with right-wingers and Tories and that makes me a better person.\"You literally cant argue with this. Anyway, freedom of speech is now seen as inherently right-wing on social media. And I really cant go on exposing myself to it, not because these arguments blinker me to alternative views, but because they dont.If I am to retain my broad faith in progressive politics, and self-government for Scotland, then abstention is the only option. I need to switch off Twitter before it turns me Tory."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-remember-many-scots-deeply-value-britishness","story":"It is important, however, to remember that since  the Scots grew into also becoming British, particularly after the  Union of the Crowns and the  Treaty of Union of the Parliaments.

The latter word carries with it unwarranted emotional baggage and implies that a nation has been militarily conquered by a foreign power and every lever of governance is directly controlled by that conqueror to the total exclusion of the local population with all decisions being made without reference to those people.Scotland and England were joined by mutual agreement in consensual Acts of Union. The correct term to use is \"secession\" when a country wishes to leave a voluntary union. Compare the Confederates position in the US civil war.

Choices have been made to prioritise investment where above the needs of our islands. Instead of replacing a single ferry each year ndash an investment only enough to allow the fleet age to stand still ndash islanders have been asked to make do and mend while billions are spent on trams, bridges and motorways.The Government deserves credit for its decision to introduce Road Equivalent Tarfwhich makes travel to our islands more affordable. This has certainly helped our economy to grow.

The latter decision is compounded by the current shipyard debacle which is likely to see the ferry delivered four years late at signicant additional cost.:Western Isles lsquoneed better ferry planrsquo says councilWhen options for the Stornoway route were consulted on, island voices were united that the solution should be a two-ferry service. A new ferry alongside the MV Isle of Lewis, operating from existing infrastructure at a cost of pound millionMillion. Independent consultancy advice supported this proposal.However, CMAL, Calmac and Transport Scotland favoured a single large ferryand harbour infrastructure investment at a cost of poundm. The total bill is now known to be poundm. The ferry cannot operate on another route and the displaced MV Isle of Lewis can only serve Barra and is not particularly appropriate for that route either as her design means she is limited in terms of freight capacity.With no local engagement, CMAL, Calmac and Transport Scotland decided to order one new ferry to replace the MV Hebrides on services to Harris and Uist. No island views were sought and no independent advice was taken. Presumably, the ldquoexperts feared we might again unite around the obvious solution of a dedicated ferry on each route.So, no improved network resilience and no ldquoradical change such as the ability to make a day trip. Instead, more of the same shared ferry arrangement which was introduced in .The final bill for  is estimated at poundm when she enters service four years late plus poundm to enable her to berth at each harbour. It is dficult to understand the logic which informed this choice, as opposed to investing poundm in a ferry which could operate alongside Hebrides.Had islanders been listened to, the funding already committed by Government would have delivered fit for purpose ferry services on our routes to Stornoway, Tarbert, Lochmaddy, Lochboisdale and Castlebay. The spend could have delivered new major ferries on each of these routes with enough left over for the new ferries needed to serve other islands including Mull and Islay.Conventional vessels that we would have supported being built in Scotland!There could be additional operating costs from increasing the size of the fleet at CalMacrsquos disposal but these can be managed by good vessel design and efficient crewing. Pentland Ferriesrsquo new MV Alfred can carry the same as the MV Hebrides, but has a crew about half the size. Crews should also live in the area they serve and not on hotels provided on board the ferry.It is not just the capital investment decisions that have let us down. Recent years have seen increasingly poor responses by Calmac to network problems.Whether it be the lack of any service whatsoever to Barra recently over a period of five days, or the response to the technical failure that beset MV Clansmanrsquosfrom dry dock in  when Calmac moved the MV Hebrides away from her route, only to then move her back again when the smaller replacement could not move the Easter weekend traffic waiting at the pier.Islanders looked on in dismay as mainland-based senior management made bad decisions.It is time to walk the talk on community empowerment and let islanders make the decisions on our leline services instead of the manner in which investment and operational decisions are being made by centralised bodies.The island-based staff and area management are excellent.

Mr Umunna would eventually join the Liberal Democrats.Labourrsquos Ian Austin quit the party, demoralised by its lack of grip on tackling anti-Semitism an issue that would dog Jeremy Corbynrsquos leadership up to its last days.At Westminster, Theresa Mayrsquos authority was already crumbling by the time she suffered the humiliation of a Commons defeat by  votes the largest for a century.Although the Tory Government survived a subsequent no-confidence vote, the game seemed up.The Remain Alliance slowly began to flex its parliamentary muscles and take control of the Commons agenda as what it regarded as the abyss of a hard Brexit grew ever nearer.Brussels dug in its heels. Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, made clear on whether the bloc would ever renegotiate the UK-EU deal or change the backstop the answer was the same an emphatic Non.By spring the Government was losing more and more votes Mrs Mayrsquos declaration of Brexit by March  fell by the wayside as did any attempt to leave the EU without a deal.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of London to call for a Peoplersquos Vote. An online petition to revoke Article  reached five million and then six million. Support for the pro-EU Liberal Democrats began to creep up.More indicative votes were held but failed to be passed. Mrs Mayrsquos deal was defeated for a third time. An attempt at a Conservative-Labour compromise not surprisingly failed. The zombie Parliament, deadlocked, shuffled on.Another push by the Remain Alliance forced the PM to agree an October  extension. On cue, Nigel Farage reappeared to announce he was leading a new party, the Brexit Party.All the while a head of steam was building within Tory ranks to oust the beleaguered Mrs May. The final shove came at an intense meeting of the backbench  committee following a disastrous performance at the local elections in England, when the Tories lost more than , councillors. Boris Johnson swtly threw his hat in the ring.Asthings were not dramatic enough, Donald Trump arrived for a state visit, promising a ldquophenomenal post-Brexit trade deal and insisting everything, including the NHS, would be on the table a tune he would later change. But he once more made clear his preference for Mr Johnsonrsquos candidacy.As the hustings got underway the contest became a straight battle between the out-and-out Brexiteer Mr Johnson and the Remainer-turned-Brexiteer Jeremy Hunt. Given it was the party membership who had the final say, the result never seemed in doubt. The Old Etonian won two to one.After Mrs May gave her teary departure in Downing St, Mr Johnson formed his new Brexiteer Government with former Leave campaign chief Dominic Cummings heading the Downing St backroom team.By now Jo Swinson, at  had become its first female leader. A poll rating of  per cent began to give the Lib Dems hope of a dramatic breakthrough.Over summer, Mr Johnson visited Francersquos Emmanuel Macron, insisting the Brexit impasse could be broken \"with energy and creativity\" a new deal could be sealed by Hallowersquoen.Then in late August the PM dropped his political bombshell he asked the Queen to suspend Parliament until October . Outrage followed from political opponents. Demonstrations were held. Things began to hot up considerably.After he lost his Commons majority thanks to another Tory defection, a bill to block a no-deal was passed with the help of Conservative rebels. Some , including senior figures like Dominic Grieve, Ken Clarke and David Gauke, were sacked. Amber Rudd later resigned in sympathy.The PM suffered a personal blow when his brother Jo left Government, saying he was \"torn between family and the national interest\".After a second attempt to call a snap election failed, Parliament was prorogued amid unprecedented protests in the Commons with some Opposition MPs holding up signs saying \"silenced\".The drama then moved up a gear. Three judges at Scotlandrsquos highest civil court ruled the Governments prorogation of Westminster was unlawful.In Bournemouth at the Lib Dem conference, the party voted to back a policy to revoke Brexitit won a General Election.A week later as Labour held its annual conference in Brighton, the UK Supreme Court made its bombshell announcement it agreed with the Court of Session. A day later MPs were back at Westminster for one of the worst-tempered days in living memory.Mr Johnson branded the law blocking a no-deal Brexit as the ldquoSurrender Bill, which caused Opposition MPs to urge him to tone down his language given the threats against MPs. He denounced the attack as ldquohumbug, later insisting his comments had been misconstrued.As the Tories held their conference, it was overshadowed by claims the PM had had an affair with US model-turned-businesswoman Jenner Arcuri. He continued to deny any conflict of interest.Pressure mounted on Mr Corbyn to call a no-confidence vote in the Government but the reality was he did not have the numbers to succeed.Mr Johnson, who had repeatedly declared Britain would leave the EU on October  ldquono s, no buts, agreed to send a letter to Brussels seeking an extension required under the Benn Act.Yet shortly after Parliament was prorogued again to bring in a Queenrsquos Speech, the UK and EU agreed an historic deal without the notorious backstop but creating a customs border down the Irish Sea. Feeling betrayed, the Democratic Unionists insisted they could not support the new deal.A special Saturday sitting of the Commons was held to discuss it. The extension letter to Brussels was sent but not signed. Within days MPs finally passed the Brexit Bill by a majority of  but failed to agree a timetable.After EU leaders agreed to push back the Brexit deadline again to January , a motion to call a General Election was finally passed.As Parliament was dissolved Labourrsquos deputy leader Tom Watson resigned, saying he wanted to start a new chapter in his le but later would admit that the hostility he had received within the party had helped him make his mind up to leave.The campaign was dominated by the NHS and Brexit.Mr Corbyn made great play of the release of unredacted documents that he insisted showed the NHS would be up for sale in a post-Brexit trade deal with America. Donald Trump, visiting the UK for a Nato summit, strenuously denied the claim, but, seemingly to help his British host, abandoned a planned press conference and quickly ed home.Front page pictures of a boy lying on a hospital floor for hours on end awaiting treatment gave Mr Johnson his most uncomfortable moment as he pocketed the mobile phone of a TV reporter trying to get him to comment on it.But the PM was more comfortable with pictures of him bulldozing a Styrofoam wall with the words Get Brexit Done, his campaign slogan, emblazoned on the machine.While the Tory manesto was light on detail, Labourrsquos was bulging with it. Promises even continued after the latterrsquos publication with a pledge to spend almost pound billion to compensate the Waspi women for changes to their state pensions.In Scotland, the campaign was once again dominated by the constitutional question with Mr Johnson making clear there were ldquono circumstances in which he would facilitate a second independence referendum no matter how many seats the SNP won.In the end, it seemed a combination of questions about Mr Corbynrsquos leadership, Labourrsquos ldquoconfetti of manesto promises and Mr Johnsonrsquos clear commitment to ldquoget Brexit done had helped the Tories smash through Labourrsquos ldquored wall in northern England to secure an -seat majority.Mr Corbyn announced he would stand down, thus sparking a leadership contest.

Kids shouting to one another and woman up on the stage with an old piano.\"You didnt know the time - there was no children with a watch.

Thirty years after it was named the first European City of Culture, it has in recent times hosted the Commonwealth Games and the BBC Six Music Festival as well as lining up alongside Berlin to stage the  European Championships. In the year ahead it, just like global cities including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London and Rome, will host a number of matches for UEFArsquos European Football Championship and will also welcome world leaders to COP , a global climate change summit.Not bad for a city that in  was seen as so scarred by poverty, infirmity and other vestiges of its industrial past that even its own citizens questioned the rationale for choosing it over practically anywhere  as a European cultural capital.The transformation has not come easy, though. A city does not attract high-profile events in a bubble and major businesses like Barclays, which is currently building a hub on the banks of the Clyde, do not choose to create thousands of jobs in a place without discussion. Everything that has happened to Glasgow in the past three decades has happened because of the considerable effort put in by its political leaders as well as representatives of its and Scotlandrsquos business, sporting and cultural communities. They might have spent a bit of public money attending meetings, making contacts and preparing bids - they might even have spent a lot - but considering what the city has got insurely we can all agree it has been money well spent Well, no. Because faced with evidence of the seemingly profligate spending of Glasgow City Councilrsquos deputy leader David McDonald, representatives of opposition parties have declared themselves up in arms. The problem is that in addition to visiting schools, housing developments and local museums, Mr McDonald went on a number of publicly funded trips this year, with visits to Tokyo, Tallinn and Duumlsseldorf among them.Tokyo was to attend the opening of an exhibition of  works from Glasgowrsquos publicly owned Burrell Collection Tallinn was to rub shoulders with other civic leaders at the Estonian national song festival, an event Mr McDonald had been invited to as a representative of a UNESCO City of Music and Duumlsseldorf was to take part in an international summit on social cohesiveness on the invitation of the mayor of Montreal.Yet despite Glasgow working so hard to earn its emerging status as a global city - and despite the obvious advantages attending such events can bring - these were seen as beyond the pale. Conservative MSP Annie Wells reckoned Glaswegians ldquowill be understandably annoyed that an SNP councillor is spending so much of their money on this truly international class of junketing Gary Smith, Scottish secretary of staunch Labour-supporting union the GMB, agreed. ldquoGlasgow council-tax payers will be aghast at this councillorrsquos excesses, he fumed. ldquoThe cityrsquos infrastructure is decrepit, the streets are dirty and there are budget cuts affecting the elderly and vulnerable.Gary Smith does, of course, have a point. Like every other local authority in the country Glasgow City Council has been struggling with budgetary constraints whose effects are plain for all to see. Walk down any street and the filth is astonishing, with the absence of blocked drains, overflowing bins and dog dirt more remarkable than their presence. At the same time, the council is failing so miserably to meet its obligations to house everyone presenting as homeless that it has been placed under review by the Scottish Government, threatened with legal action by homelessness charity Shelter and been made the subject of an inquiry by the Scottish Housing Regulator. The city has its problems, alright, and then some.Yet damning as those and many other issues are, none of that will be solved by the city turning in on itself. Far from this being the time for Glasgowrsquos leaders to hunker down and worry solely about how to cope with shrinking budgets, this is precisely the moment the city should be selling itself on the global stage, using the confidence it has gained over the past  years to attract the kind of investment that will at least give it the opportunity to thrive.To suggest that politicians like Mr McDonald should snub invitations to build international links on the basis that all foreign trips are junkets is small minded in the extreme. It does nothing to address the very real issues Glasgow faces, but does plenty to damage the mature, confident, outward-looking image the city has worked so hard to create.The artist and author Alasdair Gray, whose death at the weekend has left an unimaginable hole in Scotlandrsquos cultural landscape, wrote repeatedly about Glasgowrsquos magnicence and to a large extent it was him who helped shape our recognition and understanding of that. As he had the character Duncan Thaw say in his masterwork Lanark, unless a city has been used by an artist ldquonot even the inhabitants live there imaginatively. ldquoThink of Florence, Paris, London, New York, the character said. ldquoNobody visiting them for the first time is a stranger because hersquos already visited them in paintings, novels, history books and films.Alasdair Grayrsquos books and drawings, murals and poems have helped elevate Glasgow into the kind of city its inhabitants are proud to live in and whose visitors feel no strangeness in. Our civic leaders have a duty not just to nurture that legacy but to develop it too.Sure Glasgow has problems with potholes and cleanliness, homelessness and drug addiction, but Tory politicians and Labour-soaked unions are wrongthey think that public funds should be spent on fixing that and that alone. Glasgow has earned the right to host events and exhibitions that will play a part in its future prosperity, but its leaders have had to work hard for that - and not just in the City Chambers. To suggest otherwise displays a stunning lack of imagination."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-need-independence-improve-lives-impoverished","story":"I am not a ldquokilts, haggis and shortbread nationalist. To me the Declaration of Arbroath is as irrelevant as is the date  its done, forget it, lets look forwards not back. I believe Scotland should control its destiny simply because the common man would stand a better chance of having a decent le out from under Westminsterrsquos control. As part of the wider UK, we Scots live in a Union which is experiencing increasing levels of poverty, homelessness and declining le-expectancy, where the hard-earned egalitarian social improvements gained after two world wars are gradually being rolled back by the Establishment. We suffer under a UK system of governance that is happy to pay eight per cent of total government tax revenue in interest to the bankers while failing to address large-scale tax evasion and avoidance facilitated by that sector. A political environment where lies, obfuscation and the deliberate withholding or suppression of information are commonplace. A system that rewards obedient, compliant MPs rejected by the electorate at the ballot box with le peerages and awards a knighthood to a minister who introduced social welfare changes that had a devastating effect on those least able to object.Thousands of Scots are now forced to rely on charity food banks simply to survive, kids go to school hungry and poorly clothed and in this age of supposed enlightenment the major factor determining onersquos future le is still simply the bed you are born in.Those are some of the reasons why Scotland needs independence because as long as we are shackled to Westminster things simply cannot and will not change. That is also why Scottish Labour needs to get off the fence and support the cause.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.IAN W Thomsonclaims that there are many Scots who ldquodeeply value their Britishness. That, indeed, is the problem. Far too many of them are indferent to the fact that England dominates the Westminster Parliament by a long way and Scotland will always come second best in this political context. I place a high value on my European identity and have had it snatched away from me by a bunch of right-wing zealots in England, despite my country voting to remain in the European Union.Britishness may be important to Mr. Thomson but, for me, it stands for an arrogant and self-satisfied political system which may have had an empire but whose supporters still donrsquot realise that all that \"glory\" is over and done with. And a jolly good thing too!Dave Stewart, Glasgow G.BETWEEN walking the dog and contemplating some DIY, the very old film Lady Hamilton is on the telly. Some of the dialogue related to Englands power and the need for England to fight Napoleon Bonaparte. As this was playing, I read in todays Heraldthe letters from Ian W Thomson, Stefan Slater and Tim Ryan in particular, where comment is made on Britishness and the -year-old Union of the nations of England and Scotland.I have written before on this matter pointing out that as a child in the s and s I was raised and educated to be British with Scottishness being a reduced status, with for example playground Scots being termed \"slang\" and being told that it must not be used. In my working le I came across many examples of Scotland being considered as a part of England and English colleagues rarely,ever, thinking of themselves as British. Then, a few years ago I read Arthur Hermans book on the Scottish Enlightenment.

It means Scotland will be the first UK country to outlaw smacking and will give young people the same protection from assault as adults.A consultation on Mr Finniersquos bill was widely supported by childrenrsquos charities however opponents have argued that the law already protected children from assault and the ban risked criminalising lsquogood parentsrsquo for using reasonable chastisement.It has been likened by some opponents to the Scottish Governmentrsquos failed lsquonamed personsrsquo legislation which was ditched following criticism that it could place ordinary families under undue scrutiny.The new research by campaign group Be Reasonable received  responses from  Scottish councillors, representing % of the countryrsquos local councillors.Despite claims that the survey is too small to be reliable, the group says it spotlights a deep ide between the views of local politicians and Holyrood.It also warns that while the law change could see increased pressure on social services and a need for extra training for teachers and health workers, there has so far been no indication that the Scottish Government plans to release funds to help cover additional costs.Be Reasonable spokesman Jamie Gillies, said: ldquoThree-quarters of councillors who completed the survey felt local authorities will not cope with additional pressures brought about by a change in the law.ldquoCrucially, social workers ndash who are already cracking under the pressure of identying and helping vulnerable children ndash are also thought to be unable to cope.ldquoMany councillors seem aghast at the prospect of a smacking ban which would tie up social workers, deplete local authority resources and affect services for years to come when there is no reliable evidence to show that mild physical discipline is harmful to children.ldquoWhen signicant numbers of councillors in all of the main parties oppose legislation the Government should take notice.The survey claims seven in  councillors think parents should be allowed to use reasonable chastisement on their children. A similar number do not think smacking should become a criminal offence.While only the Scottish Conservatives opposed the bill in Holyrood, the survey suggests half of SNP and Lib Dem councillors who responded agree that parents should be permitted to use reasonable chastisement with their children. The numbers were higher among Labourand Conservative .Meanwhile, more than seven in  councillors felt the Government should finance the implications of a smacking ban ldquoas fully as necessary over time and provide ldquopublic assurances that no other frontline services will be affected as a consequence of the Bill erting resources.According to Be Reasonable responses to the survey from councillors suggests confusion over how the smacking ban might work, with one apparently unclear over whether the new law would apply to foreign tourists and another raising concerns that it may lead to family disputes and unproven allegations.One councillor commented that ldquosomeneed a quick, harmless smack on the leg or bottom to save them from harm, while another raised concerns that the legislation is ldquooverly heavy-handed and is not proportionate to the issue.Others raised concerns over the extra workload for police and social services, with one commenting: ldquoAs usual with Scottish Government, they will simply pass the buck to hard-pressed local authorities, as they have with so many other subjects.ldquoIf they want this it must be fully resourced out of their annual underspend.Responding to the survey, Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoItrsquos typical of the SNP to rush through a headline-grabbing law without thinking about the consequences.ldquoThe Nationalists were well-warned about these challenges but blundered on regardless.ldquoNow we have a situation where the SNP is creating criminals of ordinary parents and placing immense pressure on council services which are already struggling to cope.Childrenrsquos Minister Maree Todd said: ldquoThe Act gives children, without exception, the same protection from assault as adults.ldquoThis is backed by an overwhelming majority of public opinion and commanded support from a wide range of Scottish society including the Church of Scotland, Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, the Royal College of Paediatrics  Child Health , Children First and Barnardorsquos.ldquoWe are working in partnership with organisations including local authorities, childrenrsquos charities, Social Work Scotland and Police Scotland to raise awareness of the Act and build on the existing support we offer to children and families."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-reassures-eu-citizens-new-year-message","story":"The First Minister highlighted theUN climate change summit in Glasgow in November as key date for the year ahead, which she said would give Scotland the chance to show it is leading by example.Addressing the UKrsquos scheduled exit from the EU in January, the SNP leader sought to reassure EU citizens and said the Scottish Government would work towards giving people the opportunity to ldquodetermine Scotlandrsquos future.:Nicola Sturgeon lsquoshowboatingrsquo instead of fixing public services, opposition claimldquoAs we celebrate the start of  and a new decade, we look forward to a year in which Scotland will be at the centre of international attention, she said.ldquoIn November, the United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow will attract more than , people from around the world.ldquoHopefully that summit will lead to progress in tackling the most important issue that the world faces.ldquoAnd it will give Scotland a chance to show that we are leading by example ndash not just by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions but by doing so in a way that helps to build a fairer, healthier and happier society.The First Minister added:ldquoThe Glasgow summit comes near the end of what will be a historic year.ldquoAgainst the wishes of most people in Scotland, we will leave the European Union at the end of January.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh said it was \"disappointed\" at the move.:Edinburgh gets set forHogmanaycelebrationsLast month, Edinburghs council leader ordered urgent action after memorial benches were moved and piled up to make way for the capitalrsquos Christmas market. The benches were dumped at the edge of the market in East Princes Street Gardens.They are understood to cost thousands of pounds and families donate them to the park in memory of loved ones.Christmas market operator Underbelly said they were handled respectfully.The Edinburgh Hotels Association has also said it wants an urgent rethink of how the city is promoted globally in the wake of the row over the Hogmanay event and the Christmas festival.The Christmas market, which is also run by Underbelly and has taken over an expanded site across Princes Street Gardens for its six-week run, attracting about , visitors a day, has already been the source of controversy this year.Edinburgh World Heritage, the organisation charged with protecting the citys status as a Unesco site, said it should be scaled back, saying it ldquoclearly disrupts this magnicent environment to a very great extent.There has been further criticism on social media over the pound charge - including a pound booking fee - to take part in the annual New Years Day Loony Dook n which people e into the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, often in fancy dress.The registration fee was introduced when it became part of the Edinburgh Hogmanay Festival from . The fee originally pound was introduced to cover the cost of organisation and stewarding.It wasraised to pound in  and is now pound with an amount from every ticket going to the RNLI.The festive fiasco has highlighted wider worries about the citys direction, which stretches to concerns over holiday lettings in Edinburgh, as Airbnb lets alone have doubled to , since . The Edinburgh World Heritage Trust, among other groups, has drawn attention to the loss of community around the Royal Mile and Old Town as residents have moved out.In the summer, Edinburgh fringe director Shona McCarthy has said the festival is ldquoseriously in danger of being anti-tourist, describing the suggestion that the fringe itself was contributing to excessive tourism as weird.But Mr Bartlam of Underbelly has accused critics of taking advantage of the controversy to make a political point.He said: \"This whole issue is a bit of a red herring and a mis-truth. This event has never prevented residents coming to their own properties.\"There has been a system in place which was a system created by the council and the previous operator of the contract years ago which obviously meant that residents that lived within the event arena had to have a wristband, as many as they needed for their household and that continues and now no-one is prevented from getting access.\"There is a wider conversation going on in Edinburgh at the moment around the impact of festivals and the vast majority of people in Edinburgh understand the cultural, social and economic benefit of amazing festivals like Hogmanay.\"There are some that feel that there are too many of these and are potentially using some suggestions of residents not being allowed access which is untrue as a way of pushing that view.\"Mr Bartlam added that only nine people had contacted Underbelly worried about a potential lack of passes, and claimed Hogmanay brings nearly poundm to the city in economic benefit.He said: \"Everyone can get a pass for the number of people in their property or people they want to have.\"The organisers have, however, acknowledged there had been \"misunderstandings\" and rewrote website guidance following the backlash, which now reads: \"If you are planning a privatewithin your home or you are entertaining guests or you have a household larger than six, additional access passes are available.\"Edinburgh City Council leader Adam McVey said the event had been affected by \"poor communication\", adding: \"It is unacceptable that the guidance for residents didnt accurately reflect this, creating unnecessary confusion.\"Mike Small of the Citizen Network, an Edinburgh-based campaign organisation aiming to transform the capital into ldquoa place for people rather than profit told supporters in his latest blog of how the Hogmanay fiasco had provided a boost to its campaign.

Where the wrong decision had been made and he had the chance to correct it, he was happy to do so.ldquoHe said that it had been a great honour to represent Scotland at the commemorations in Normandy on Sunday,  June on the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The ceremonies had been very professional and emotional.ldquoThe contribution and sacrice which Scots, and forces from all over the world, had made to the liberation of Europe through their involvement in the Normandy landings had ensured the preservation of democracy.ldquoHe paid tribute to those who had given their lives in the landings.An analysis of news and current events presented to the cabinet described Mr McConnell enduring ldquofierce criticism for turning down an invitation to attend the D-Day commemorations.After he reversed his position, there were then ldquonumerous articles and editorial in the weekend newspapers, ldquomainly focused on the First Ministerrsquos lsquoU-turnrsquo and the role played by his advisers.Bizarrely, the then Labour First Minister of Wales was caught up in a similar row, agreeing to attend a golf event at the Celtic Manor resort near Newport to discuss Wales hosting the  Ryder Cup, instead of going to Normandy.Other cabinet minutes also show Mr McConnell trying to fix another of his mistakes.After publicly supporting Glasgow singer Michelle McManus through her successful bid to win TVrsquos Pop Idol in , he conspicuously failed to congratulate Ayrshire violinist Nicola Benedetti when she won the less-watched BBC Young Musician of the Year in .He called three days later - after growing public criticism - and suddenly announced he was holding a reception for successful young Scots.The cabinet minute of  May  records: ldquoThe First Minister said that he had congratulated Nicola Benedetti on being the first Scot to win the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition.ldquoShe was one of many Scottish young people who had awards and recognition in ious fields, including sport and culture. He planned to hold a reception in the summer celebrating the success or young Scots over the past  months in all fields, and asked Cabinet members to nominate young people who might be involved to attend the event.Coming shortly after his infamous kilt and blouse outfit in New York, the Normandy and Benedetti gaffes made  a turning point for Mr McConnellrsquos credibility."},{"url":null,"title":"hogmanay-celebrations-begin-edinburgh","story":"The streets of Edinburgh filled up with Hogmanay revellers preparing to welcome in the start of a new decade and enjoy the UKs biggest street party.Performances from Idlewild, Rudimental and Marc Almond were taking place on stages throughout the city centre, while DJ Mark Ronson is ushering in the new year, creating a new soundtrack ahead of the clock striking .Approximately , visitors are expected to attend the event, according to organisers who billed the Hogmanay celebrations as the UKs biggest New Years Eve street party.TV stars Ant and Dec took to the stage in Princes Street Gardens earlier in the evening as crowds gathered, playing music and introducing the first firework display of the night.Street theatre, circus acts and musical performances also took place up across more than a dozen streets, including the citys main throughfare Princes Street and its adjacent gardens, while ceilidhs danced their way into the night in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle.There had been criticism of the events organisation, amid uncertainty around how many passes residents were allowed, with Underbelly - which also runs the Edinburgh Festival Fringe - accused of creating \"unnecessary confusion\" by the council leader.The festivities began in the city on Monday as around , people joined a torchlit procession which culminated in them forming the shape of two humans reaching out a \"hand of friendship\".Leading the parade down the Royal Mile and into Holyrood Park was a -strong cast from Celtic Fire Theatre company PyroCeltica."},{"url":null,"title":"artists called on to light the north for clan","story":"CLAN Cancer Support is calling for artists from across the north-east to create designs for its Light the North trail lighthouses.Over  sculptures will be situated across Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Shetland and Orkney in autumn  to raise funds for CLAN.Each lighthouse will be inidually designed and painted by some of the region’s most talented artists, using a iety of materials and artistic techniques.Artists can submit any design, and artists of any age, no matter where they live, are invited to take part.A live event will be held in April where sponsors will choose their favourite design from the artist submissions and successful designers will then be commissioned to paint the sculpture.The three-metre tall lighthouses are being sponsored by iniduals and businesses across the north-east and will be placed on a trail covering the region including the northern isles from September – October .The lighthouses will be auctioned in December .Fiona Fernie, project director said: “We have been overwhelmed by the support of the north-east for Light the North, and already have over  lighthouse sponsors, spread across the whole region, including inidual sponsors, small businesses and large firms.“This next phase of inviting designs is very exciting, and we are looking forward to seeing the immense creativity that exists in the area.”To submit a design, artists should visit lightthenorth.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gillian Martin with Stella Angus\"  Pupil wins MSPs Christmas card competition viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"forever home for tia and sulley","story":"The Scottish SPCA is delighted to have found a loving, permanent home for a mare and her foal, Tia and Sulley.Tia was pregnant when she came into the care of the Aberdeenshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in December  after her owner could no longer care for her.Sulley was born in the centre in May and it was the only home he had ever known.Tia and Sulley found their forever home with mother and daughter, Ria and Alex.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after she was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni, on Monday.And the psychologist who assessed the woman as part of her defence case, Dr Christine Tizzard, said she was concerned the trial had not fully considered that she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .She told the : ldquoThe salient point is that she was diagnosed with PTSD.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm who can consign the jeremy corbyn era to the dustbin of history","story":"The last thing Labour needs is continuity in its quest for a leader who isn#t embarrassed to be a patriot, says Euan McColmWhen Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party in , he promised a new kind of politics. He certainly delivered that.Now in the grip of a hard-left cabal, Corbyn’s party is a sectarian mess, a safe place for anti-Semites and crank conspiracists. But the leader of the Opposition hasn’t succeeded only in creating a new kind of politics. He has also introduced a new way of losing elections.Clinging to leadershipThere was a time when a leader so comprehensively humiliated in a general election would have resigned immediately, offering profound apologies to all in his party who had been failed by him.Corbyn’s dferent kind of defeat has involved him clinging on to the leadership, arguing – pathetically – that Labour won the argument, and seeing that the advisers who directed the party’s election disaster are signed up to permanent contracts, protecting them from the fate – redundancy – that is now befalling scores of junior staffers.Corbyn says he is remaining in place so that the party can go through a period of reflection on its defeat. Once it is clear what went wrong, he’ll shuffle off and a leadership election will tasked place.This is all bulls**t, of course. Ask any Labour activist why the party lost the general election and,they are honest, they will tell you that the party’s biggest problem was Corbyn. Time and again while canvassing, candidates were told by voters – many of whom had backed Labour all their lives – that they simply couldn’t support the party while he was in charge. Among the reasons were anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, a manesto full of promises that appeared wildly unaffordable, and the leader’s record of siding – throughout history – with the United Kingdom’s enemies.Scottish LabourNow, we witness the pitul efforts of Labour members to persuade themselves that among those who are tipped to run for the top job there are credible candidates who will turn round the party’s fortunes.Labour in Scotland has been in crisis for more than a decade. The SNP has slipped into the political space once occupied by its opponents.But south of the border, things are not yet so bleak for Labour.This will soon changemembers make a foolish decision when it comes to choosing the new leader.In the immediate aftermath of the general election, there was much chatter about the need for Labour to choose a leader who was both northern and female. The logic ran that voters who had turned their nose up at a London-based leader would the leader was someone with whom they could more easily identy.This is nonsense. Voters in the north of England who turned from Corbyn decided to put their faith in Boris Johnson. The flatness of the Labour leader’s vowels has nothing to do with their decision.The Corbyn continuity candidate in the coming leadership election campaign will probably be the wholly unimpressive Rebecca Long Bailey, a northerner who was  per cent behind the sainted Jeremy, even when it was clear he was unfit for office.The importance of patriotismLong Bailey will face challenges from Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, neither of whom has done much to make one think they can turn Labour’s fortunes around. Both seem as distant from the voting public as Corbyn ever did. And both, I’m afraid, are tainted by playing central roles in supporting the Corbyn project which has been so roundly rejected by the electorate.Labour’s media outriders, those columnists and pundits who made careers out of excusing Corbyn’s associations with terrorists and his failure to deal adequately with anti-Semitism, really struggle to deal with the popularity of Johnson with a signicant number of working class voters.At the heart of their confusion lies one of the big problems with the Corbyn project – the failure of its adherents to recognise the importance of patriotism. In dismissing anyone who declares even the slightest affection for the country of their birth as a petty nationalist, the Corbynista offends the small “c” conservative voter who thinks the UK has often been a force for good.Accepting this reality is crucial to the Labour Party’s survival.Swathes of the Labour membership will continue to delude themselves that their man won the argument and that what is needed is a new face to present ideas put forward by Corbyn.But smarter activists will think carefully about how Labour can rebuild a connection with voters who have abandoned the party. The first step in this process is accepting that Labour cannot expect the voters to come to the party. Rather, the party must go to them.Social democratThe new leader should be a social democrat rather than a revolutionary socialist, someone who isn’t ashamed to sing the national anthem, and someone who is as untainted as it is possible to be by association with Corbyn.Were I a member of the Labour Party with a vested interest in its survival, I’d be encouraging Dan Jarvis to step forward. Jarvis, a former soldier, was spoken about as a possible challenger for the leadership when Ed Miliband quit in .Instead of stepping into that fight, Jarvis – MP for Barnsley Central – turned his attention to his local area, campaigning successfully to become mayor of the Sheffield City Region.Jarvis succeeded in the mayoral battle on his own terms, without the patronage of Corbyn.Recently, Jarvis said it was time for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era. That politics had failed, he said, and it was time to start rebuilding credibility.Unsurprisingly, Corbynistas were horried by Jarvis’s remarks. He is not one of them, after all, and is therefore to be treated with a mixture of suspicion and contempt.But Jarvis was right. Labour’s credibility has been shot to Hell by Jeremy Corbyn and a fresh start is essential.If Dan Jarvis does enter the leadership race, he’ll start as an outsider, buthe can reach out beyond the party to the general public and win opinion poll support, he may force Labour members to ask themselves whether it’s time to think about how they start winning again.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh council leader suggests hogmanay party could be scaled down from global bucket list status in future","story":"Adam McVey, who spoke out hours after an online petition was launched calling on the cityrsquos youngest ever council leader to quit over the handling of the cityrsquos winter festivals, said it would be ldquoperfectly legitimate for Edinburgh to have a dferent model for its new year festivities in future.He also suggested politicians would need to be ldquomore involved in how they are run in future.The ongoing Christmas and Hogmanay festivities have been dogged by controversies over a new wristband system for local residents, the impact of event infrastructure on the city centre, and the removal of a traditional Nativity scene and the cityrsquos Norwegian Christmas tree to make way for a whisky sponsorrsquos branding.Festival producers Underbelly issued a rallying cry in the run-up to the bells to urge stakeholders in the city to get behind the Hogmanay celebrations, warning that cities around the world were trying to emulate Edinburghrsquos three-day festivities, which are being staged for the th time.Hotel industry chiefs have also warned that complaints about the cityrsquos Christmas and Hogmanay events are running the risk of Edinburgh being seen as an ldquoanti-tourist city around the world.However Mr McVey said there there were ldquoenormously erging views about the benefits of the events, which are said to be worth more than £ million to the city.

That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

The previous biggest increase was in April , when the rate rose by p from £. to £. per hour.The new rate starts on April   and will result in an increase of £ over the year for a full-time worker on the national living wage.: Eleanor Mannion:  years of the National Minimum WageHowever the rise has been criticised for both being too little, and for \"piling further pressure\" on businesses.The national living wage is the name for the minimum wage level payable to adults over the age of .

Younger workers who receive the minimum wage will see their pay boosted between . per cent and . per cent depending on their age, with  to -year-olds seeing a p increase from £. to £. an hour.The Prime Minister welcomed the \"biggest ever cash boost to the national living wage\", and added: \"Hard work should always pay, but, for too long, people havent seen the pay rises they deserve.\"Our government will put a stop to that, giving nearly three million people from Edinburgh to Eastbourne a well-earned pay rise, including the biggest ever cash boost to the national living wage.\"But thats not all.

Unlike the UK National Living Wage, this is a minimum rate which applies to all workers over the age of .“While pay legislation remains reserved to the UK Government, we continue to encourage every organisation, regardless of size, sector or location to ensure all staff receive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.”And Frances OGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for a £-per-hour national living wage. She added: \"This is a long-planned raise, but its also long overdue.\"Workers are still not getting a fair share of the wealth they create. And in-work poverty is soaring as millions of families struggle to make ends meet.

There are still over five million workers in the UK earning less than the real living wage and many families will have struggled with extra costs over the holidays, so this increase in the minimum wage provides a vital pay boost.\"However, there is a still a gap between the government minimum and the real living wage, independently calculated based on what it costs to live.\"Business organisations warned against the rise, which they said was \"piling further pressure\" on companies struggling in a time of economic uncertainty.Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Businesses want to pay their staff a good wage. They recognise and support the drive to improve living standards. But many have struggled with increased costs in a time of great economic uncertainty.\"Raising wage floors by more than double the rate of inflation will pile further pressure on cashflow and eat into training and investment budgets. For this policy to be sustainable, Government must offset these costs by reducing others, and impose a moratorium on any further upfront costs for business.\"Craig Beaumont, Federation of Small Businesses director of external affairs and advocacy, urged the Government to implement pro-business measures ahead of the next financial year.He said: \"This Government has promised a reduction in the jobs tax through an increase in the employment allowance.\"With a national living wage increase of this size now on the horizon, its critical that it delivers swtly, particularly with small business confidence plumbing new depths ahead of the election. We need this support announced in good time ahead of Aprils increase so small businesses can plan ahead.\": How firms can take a responsible business approach to financial wellbeing in the workforceChancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid hailed the rise, and said the wages of the lowest-paid full-time workers have increased by £, since the national living wage was introduced in .He added: \"But we want to do more to level up and tackle the cost of living, which is why the national living wage will increase further to £. by  on current forecasts.\"In September, when the Chancellor first announced the increase, he said the national living wage would rise towards two-thirds of median earnings by , \"provided economic conditions allow\", to about £. per hour.The government said nearly three million workers are set to benefit from the increases and it is \"on track\" to meet its current target for the NLW to reach  per cent of median earnings by .Nye Cominetti, an economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation think tank, welcomed the increase but warned it is \"not risk-free\". He said: \"This latest ramping up of the legal wage floor will boost the pay packets of millions of workers.\"With the government committed to delivering one of the highest wage floors in the world by , we are set for another parliament of big pay rises for the UKs lowest earners of around five per cent a year.\"This ambition is welcome but not risk-free.

He has been the MP for the seat since .The Lib Dem used his acceptance speech first to thank the ing officers, the other candidates for a #spirited and good-natured campaign#, his own campaign team, and we and family, who had been #staunch in their support#.He went on to say that representing the people of Orkney and Shetland had been, and remained, his #greatest privilege#.It was more of a #mixed picture#, as Mr Carmichael said prior to his election result announcement, for the Lib Dems across the board.The party were unable to capitalise on their strong anti-Brexit message in this election, making a net loss of one seat across the UK. They now have  MPs.This included a shock scalp in the form of party leader Jo Swinson, who lost her Dunbartonshire seat earlier in the night to the SNP.Despite being pipped to the post in this constituency, it was the SNP who made big gains across Scotland, taking  more seats. The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives.

Hand the EU control of our economy and trade, agriculture and fisheries.Throw in control ofenergy and our military and Scots will never vote for it. They know that, too.

It follows that they are only demanding Indyref  because they #ken fine weel# it won#t be allowed and will use that to stoke phoney grievance against Westminster, with the added advantageof it being over before we find out what kind of trade deals Westminster achieves with the EU, US, etc.Goodness, so the SNP did so well because they are aLeave Party!No, Brian. The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#.Why don#t you tell us, Brian After all, you are one of the ones who deserted Labour, jumping ship to the SNP.The reasons for Labour#s demise in Scotland were not much to do with Brexit.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

Kezzie, the -year-old Border Collie who is around  years old in human years, might be more refined in age but getting her forever home has given her a new lease of le.Nuala Wilson, who has been a supporter of Dogs Trust for some time, had been searching for a canine companion with her partner Lance. They had seen Kezzie’s pictures on the Dogs Trust website and wanted to meet her.Nuala said: “We visited the Rehoming Centre, where all the other dogs were so excited and lively in their kennels. Kezzie just seemed so relaxed and we got the chance to meet and play with her.“Despite being an older dog, she has the heart of a puppy and I personally believe she chose us as her new owners as much as we chose her. Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and although she is on a special diet for her tummy, she will get some tummy friendly treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, Assistant Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said:“We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family.“Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies skyrocket by % in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. Our slogan, A dog is for le, not just for Christmas, is still very relevant and a reminder to think carefully about the lelong commitment of getting a pet before making the decision.“If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Visit www.dogstrust.org.uk adogisforle to find out more about fostering, sponsoring a dog and for advice on dog ownership.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"lisburn and castlereagh council spends 462k","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

Doubling the numbers in Irish-medium education is a big challenge but we can meet that ambition head on by creating the right foundations in our naionrai.“We should also be looking at ways to deepen community engagement around Irish-medium early years and schools.“I think we also need to look at incentives to attract students from Gaeltacht areas to teaching and how we can increase the supply of those with a high standard of Irish to work in Irish-medium education settings across the board.  We can also consider how we can improve opportunities for gaelscoileanna to expand.”The policy will be developed in collaboration with other relevant departments including the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.The work will be overseen by an inter-departmental steering committee and supported by an advisory committee comprised of relevant stakeholders.The Minister added: “This new policy for Irish-medium education will raise the profile of our language in our communities and I believe it will also encourage the daily use of Irish inside and outside our schools.”"},{"url":null,"title":"legal fundraiser for briton convicted in cyprus reaches","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s a standalone diagnosis. It’s a valid diagnosis and it hasn’t really been fully represented.“Aside the fact it hasn’t been fully represented, it means she’s been unable to get the treatment she so sorely needs and every day she’s not having treatment the worse it gets.”But the government of Cyprus has said it has “full confidence in the justice system and the courts”.Cyprus’ attorney general said on Tuesday that he could not suspend the trial because she had levelled “grave accusations” against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.He said the woman’s allegation that police coerced her into retracting her rape claim “could not have been left to linger” so he could not move to suspend the trial.In a statement, Mr Clerides added: “Any intervention on the part of the attorney general, either for reasons of public interest or any other reasons, would have constituted nothing more than an obstacle to ascertaining the true facts of the case, as well as interference in the judiciary’s work.”Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said he believed the woman had made  allegations because she felt “embarrassed” after realising she had been filmed having sex in a video found on some of the Israelis’ mobile phones.“The defendant gave police a  rape claim, while having full knowledge that this was a lie,” he said.“There was no rape, or violence, and police had carried out a thorough investigation making all necessary arrests.”The woman has been on bail since the end of August, after spending a month in prison, and could face up to a year in jail and a , eurofine when she is sentenced on January .Her lawyers said they will appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court of Cyprus and the European Court of Human Rightsnecessary.The teenager said that she was “dedicated to seeking true justice”, while her mother described the verdict as “absolutely astonishing” and said her daughter was “effectively in a gilded cage” as she awaits sentencing on the island."},{"url":null,"title":"man who gifted cash for christmas goes viral for his homemade packaging","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Judge Jenkins also denied Mr Jones’ request to dismiss the lawsuit.Mr Jones operates Infowars in Texas. He is fighting similar lawsuits in Connecticut brought by other families of Sandy Hook victims for promoting a theory that the shooting was a hoax. A -year-old gunman killed  first-graders, six educators and himself at the school, after having killed his mother at their Newtown home.The families said they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Mr Jones’ followers because of the hoax conspiracy.Mr Jones has since acknowledged that the Sandy Hook killings occurred. His lawyers have defended his speech in court as “rhetorical hyperbole” and deny it was defamation.In June, the father of six-year-old Noah Pozner, one of the Sandy Hook victims, won a defamation lawsuit against the authors of a book that claimed the shooting never happened."},{"url":null,"title":"505273","story":"A number of County Derry shops have scooped prizes in Causeway Coast and Glens Councils annual festive window display competition.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money.

It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done.

For the third year running and back by popular demand, Roy Arbuckle is joined by his frequent collaborator, singer Anne Tracey, for an acoustic afternoon of music, song and poetry at the Seamus Heaney Home Place on January th between pm and pm. Says Roy, “ The poetry of Seamus Heaney has always captured my attention. Often Heaney manages to say with a touching sensitivity and brilliant eloquence the kinds of things I am also trying to say through my own song writing. His is truly poetry ‘for the soul’. To be invited to play at the Heaney Home Place for this the third January running is a special honour and a thrill.” googletag.cmd.push During their afternoon gig, Anne and Roy will feature tracks from their “Songs for the Soul” CD as well as songs from artists as ious as Judy Collins, Tom Waits and the late and much mourned, Eamon Friel. Anne explained: “Both of us are delighted to be joined by that fabulous musician and arranger, “the maestro” Eddie O Donnell on keys and guitar as well as by my brother, Michael Corey, a mighty singer with a wide repertoire of songs.” Anne Tracey is well known for her very successful annual City of Derry Jazz festival shows. Like Roy she too is delighted and honoured by the invitation to sing at the Heaney Home Place. “The six of us are all looking forward to performing together.” she said. “We have chosen a set-list which includes both original and traditional songs, songs we hope will touch the hearts of the audience gathered in the Heaney Home Place just a couple of weeks into the new year, songs with a story to them, songs that explore the pull of ‘ home’ ‘identity and ‘place’ and songs with a bit of craic to them. googletag.cmd.push “Though I have lived in Derry for a long number of years, for me it is special to be performing in such a magnicent venue so close to my own home town of Moneymore. And I am thrilled that my brother, Brendan Corey, is making a pilgimage to the Heaney Home Place all the way from Long Island, New York. Brendan has been singing and playing professionally in New York for over forty years but has joined us for a few songs over the past three years. He is truly smitten by the atmosphere and audience reception in the Heaney Home Place.” Tickets available on line or by ringing  .

Like McAteer. Red Organ Serpent Sound came back to headline the magic Tuned In Project’s fundraiser show. They then released their second album’s demos. They haven’t released their first album yet but I’m assured it’s on its way.We proved ourselves more than capable of putting ourselves on the map via the Celtronic, Feile, Together, Stendhal, Oscillations and Modulations festivals, not to mention the fundraiser gigs for NICU and the Tuned In Project, great times and great music were had by all. googletag.cmd.push Damien Dempsey came back to Derry for the anniversary of the Civil Rights movement’s most important work.The music and performing arts course in the tech headed up by Rory Donaghy and Grainne McNamaragave itself the credit it deserves and is now living under the new identity MAPA and being rightfully celebrated for training up the musicians and tech-heads that keep our funny wee engine running. Marty Coyle went to Bulgaria as a musician in residence and came back with whole new bag of ingredients for future Balkan Derry work. You were probably in Tinney’s watching them last night and no doubt agree wholeheartedly.Janet Hoy and a group of other artists created “The Stone Tapes” which were sonic representations of the Walls of Derry, the memories trapped in stone can be heard at www.stonetapes. The Clameens played their first live show since disbanding without Doyle at Lisahally in August and promised us nothing really. They came, they saw, they conquered and they’ll let us know the craic sure.The Clameens have sadly aged and now the young punks have taken over. No Collusion are leading the way for independent, frenetic noise and keeping the spirit of Bam Bam  The Calling well and truly alive. Between them, Fast Thursday and Happy Out the punk scene is well and truly flourishing. Rebecca Harkin released “Things Man Be Someway” and Great White Lies released “Chrysalis” and both proved that jazz isn’t as terrible as I thought and, more importantly, the young musicians of Doire and Donegal know a million times more about music than the frequenters of the start of may party.  The late Micky Grfiths who is sadly missed.Keith Harkin continued to soar around America but landed back in Ireland to build and promote his Barn Studios and work with White Denim and The Eagles collaborators. Contact the Barn Studios on Facebook, it’s an absolute treat and the rates are magic.The year belonged to Quiet Arch and the work of Eoin O’Callaghan and Ryan Vail on their “Borders” album. Everything about it came from here, from writing and making, to promoting and videoing. A true triumph of independence that will live forever. It won the album of the year at the NI Music prize and their stablemates Cherym picked up the Oh Yeah Contender award. Sadly this year we lost Eamon Friel in June and his loss is reverberates still, a truly loved, inspiring and cherished foundation of everything musical in Derry left the kind of memories that will outlast us all. Then, in December, Micky Grfiths passed away. Joe Brown said he stopped him from going sane. I can’t think of a more beautul tribute. I genuinely hope that everyone has someone in their le like Micky. There’s loads to come in the New Year but I’ll get to that later.

The  new entry level paid internships will offer young people the chance to gain real on-the-job experience to kick-start their careers in the creative industries. TheNI Creative Employment Programmewill work with employers to establish brand new posts in order to give people opportunities in thearts and cultural sector. Creative industry businesses in Derry are encouraged to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to add to their teams. Funded by theArts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the programme will provide part funding to cover wage costs for employers who create the new jobs and hire a young person aged -. googletag.cmd.push Run by Creative  Cultural Skills NI, the project aims tosupport the next generation of arts and cultural professionals and enable the growth of the sector by directly addressing skills gaps and shortages. “We want to offer greater paid opportunities to young people with the aim of eventually eradicating unpaid internships, which are so prevalent in this sector. Budgets are very tight in this sector so by offering additional funding, this programme will not only help organisations create new, exciting positions but also allow for fairer opportunities to young people,” explained Sarah Jones of Creative  Cultural Skills NI. NICEP ran as a two year pilot programme initially and this highlighted the demand for support by both industry and iniduals with  creative businesses creating  apprentices and paid intern opportunities over that period. googletag.cmd.push Meacuteabh Rooney was a past participant on the programme, securing an internship with the NI Science Festival as a Marketing and Events Intern in . With a university degree in geography, she was working in retail when she spotted the post and applied for it. “The programme gave me a chance to get my first job in the creative sector. I never would have thought of event management as a career but I love it. I was hired back in  and for the upcoming festival and this year they are giving me the opportunity to take the lead in programming two big events so I’m continually learning and developing,” she explained. The organisation also benefitted from the NICEP funding and support. Chris McCreery, director of the Science Festival, explained: “We simply could never have done this without the support. It’s been hugely beneficial to us not just to have an extra team member but to have a new perspective by this smart, engaged young person. She quickly became a valued member of the team who has contributed so much to the festival.” The programme will support new jobs from a wide range of fields including music, dance, drama, literature, visual arts, craft, festivals, arts venues, community arts, galleries, museums, circus and carnival arts but will also accept applications from the wider creative sector including digital, film and TV. Employers looking to grow their staff teams and offer an opportunity to a young person, should contact the NI Creative Employment Programme team for more information. Roisin McDonough, Chief Executive of the Arts Council, said: “We want to encourage our talented young people to see the working in the arts as an attractive career option. The NI Creative Employment Programme was created to provide quality training and mentoring opportunities, to give fair access to careers in the creative and cultural industries, and help bolster the creative sector by harnessing the talent of the next generation.” For more information go towww.ccskills.org.ukor emailnicep@ccskills.org.uk  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme, which will extend for a distance of approximately . kilometres from its junction with the A Tobermore Road to Nutgrove Road, will greatly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network. The carriageway works on the Draperstown Road, Desertmartin will commence on Monday, January  .Given the nature of the scheme and to help ensure the safety of road users and workers, it will be necessary to implement a full road closure for the duration of the works. googletag.cmd.push During the road closure a two-way traffic ersion will be in operation along the A Tobermore Road from Desertmartin to Tobermore and the B Draperstown Road from Tobermore to Draperstown. The Nutgrove Road Tobermore Road junction will also be closed to all traffic. Residents and landowners living along Nutgrove Road should use the Iniscarn Road to access the A Tobermore Road and B Draperstown Road during the duration of this closure. Advanced warning signage for the closure will be provided and ersion routes will be signed as necessary. Local access will be facilitated.Completion of the scheme by Sunday, January  is subject to favourable weather conditions and the Department will keep the public informed of any change. googletag.cmd.push The Department has carefully programmed the works operations and traffic management arrangements in order to minimise any inconvenience to the public, however road users should expect some delays and should allow additional time when planning any journeys. The work was welcomed last week by Sinn Fein councillor Catherine Elattar who has campaigned for the much needed work. She said: At this stage, the work being done will only go as far as the Nutgrove Road, but I am hopeful that as soon as funds become available that the work will be continued along the road to Draperstown. This whole stretch of road needs to be done and we will continue to lobby for this to happen as soon as possible.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been a horrible festive period for Sean Connor’s men, two home defeats against teams in and around them at the foot of the table making the league table very bleak reading heading into . Even more concerning than the result was the performance again, a disappointing display against Warrenpoint followed up by a lacklustre display that was bereft of confidence, with Carrick gted two early goals to make this and long and fruitless day for the players in blue. googletag.cmd.push ‘Stute now travel to Linfield on New Year’s Day, and they do so level with Warrenpoint at the foot of the table, with only goal dference, and a signicant lack of confidence separating the two sides. Warning signs The warning signs were there for ‘Stute before the opening goal as Carrick looked the brighter of the two teams, Lee Chapman finding himself in a promising shooting position on the edge of the area but he dallied a moment longer than he should have and the shot was charged down. But Carrick, who had failed to score a goal since defeating ‘Stute earlier in the month, got the opener on  minutes when Kyle Cherry linked with Lloyd Anderson in the area and the latter was afforded too much space just six yards from goal, heading into the empty net after Rory Brown had parried his first effort. googletag.cmd.push  Carrick Rangers Stewart Nixon is closed down by Institutes Shaun Leppard. ‘Stute tried to respond but they could well have fallen two goals behind when a long thro into the area led to miscommunication between Brown and Shaun Leppard, with the centre-half flicking a header past his own goalkeeper right across goal with everyone in blue relieved that the ball did not find the net. ‘Stute began to bother Carrick after  minutes and whilst Cormac Burke may have been overly ambitious in his attempt at goal from wide on the left, it did lead to a corner from which Conor Tourish came so close to levelling, his glancing header just wide of the target. Yet just when it seemed that ‘Stute were getting into the game. A mistake at the back cost them dearly as Dean Curry failed to intercept a simple ball and Lee Chapman went clear down the right before firing a low cross to the back post where Reece Neale arrived with a simple tap in for -. ‘Stute boss Sean Connor responded to that by making a substitution after just  minutes, Adam Green on for a clearly disappointed Shaun Leppard. The remainder of the half was all effort without reward for ‘Stute with Joe McCready doing his best to make something happen, but it was Carrick who looked the more dangerous regardless. The visitor came so close to making it - just before the break when Brown hesitated coming off his line and as a result he came off second best in a challenge with Stewart Nixon. The loose ball broke to Chapman in the area and he thought he had scored until young Jack Bradley arrived in the nick of time to clear the ball off the line. Half Time - The introduction of Jamie Dunne just after the break gave ‘Stute some more energy and le in attack, the winger announcing his arrival with a brilliant and determined run into the penalty area before dinking a cross over goalkeeper Ben Nicholl but Joe McCready was unable to capitalise. The greater threat remained with Carrick as the game went on however and when Caolan Loughran headed down into a packed penalty area, the ball was cleared, but only to Neale lurking outside the area and his ambitious effort had to be plucked out of the air by Brown.  Institutes Graham Crown under pressure from Carrick Rangers Lloyd Anderson.  It just never looked like happening for ‘Stute with the energy and endeavour all shown by the players in white and they got the killer goal on  minutes when substitute Guillaume Keke broke down the right, won the race to the ball ahead of goalkeeper Brown and he passed across the face of the empty goal for Stewart Nixon to tap in for a simple but important goal. ‘Stute, to their credit, kept going and good work from McCready carved out a chance for Dunne inside the area, but in a moment which summed up their day, the ball beat Nicholl but rolled the wrong side of the post. It was nonetheless, the closest that ‘Stute came all day,  minutes into the game. ‘Stute’s best chances came when the game was over as a contest, but they could have had a consolation when Cormac Burke crossed for Graham Crown, and his ing header was just past the upright, much to the midfielder’s disappointment.  FINAL WHISTLE Man of the MatchReece Neale scored a fine second goal and was eager to add to his tally throughout. He added a real attacking dimension to the Carrick attack, and he did so from full back. Moment of the MatchThe first goal in this one was always going to be signicant especially for the confidence boost it would give, and it deservedly went to Carrick after an energetic start. Lloyd Anderson needed two attempts before he got his goal but he was in so much space it hardly mattered. Key BattleJoe McCready never let his head drop, and when he got the ball he was always looking to make things happen. Mark Surgeoner was kept on his toes as a result in what was an interesting battle between the striker and the defender.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates. The site at the Ministry of Defence base will encompass four pitches, a MUGA and an administration and exhibition museum centre. Down GAA will now plan to appoint a Project Board in the New Year.Maureen OrsquoHigginswas elected as the new vice-chairperson of the board, on an evening when a number of officerships changed hands.Outgoing chairman Sean Rooney was selected to represent the county on the Ulster Council alongside Sean McCashin. Donal McNallywill assume the position of Irish and Cultural Officer, while Drumgathrsquos Michael McArdle is the new delegate to Central Council.As a result of disciplined financial management in recent years, the presentation of the financial report by treasurer Diarmuid Cahill showed a strong position for the county moving forward.Fourteen motions on the convention agenda were all approved, including ten proposals to go forward to the GAA Congress in Dublin at the end of February.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you. Itrsquos best done before the night is out.ldquoAlso, I say that having a bit of good manners helps, to say thank you and to appreciate what we do for each other..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Downpatrick man.jpg","title":"Downpatrick man in roll of honour  ","story":"FORMER Downpatrick and Ireland cricket captain Alfie Linehan was included in a prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who died during .He was among  from around the world listed as lsquospecial peoplersquo in BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme broadcast at the weekend.They included England goalkeeper Gordon Banks and racing driver Niki Lauda as well as another cricketer mdash one of Englandrsquos greatest fast bowlers, Bob Willis.Alfie died in June after suffering dementia and contracting cancer.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

If the pool is completed soon it would probably lie idle because pool staff have not yet been appointed.The situation has left councillors with red faces for the second time in several months.

They were due to meet the architects this week, but instead were sent a written report on the progress being made.The council clerk, Mr Seamus Byrne, read the report at a council meeting on Monday and said he expected a completion date early in the new year. In the report the architects catalogued a series of setbacks over the past two years and blamed most of the delay on strikes and shortages of materials.Downpatrick councillor, Mr Sean Quinn, launched into a scathing attack on the architects, who, he said, had failed to serve the council as they as they should.Mr Quinn said he found it disturbing that the architects must have known of the troubles on the site, yet had still made ldquowild predictions about the proposed opening date.Mr Quinn also condemned the mounting costs of work on the scheme and then drew attention to the pool itself, saying he felt the interior design was lacking in imagination.Mr Cecil Maxwell reminded councillors that they had approved the pool design and he did not think the architects were at fault for the slow progress.DROMARA mdash ADromara schoolgirl flies out to London tomorrow to represent Northern Ireland in a major essay competition.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign. As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result. I also know that a lot of our voters did vote tactically and respect their decision to do so. Some of my friends voted SDLP this time which wonrsquot happen in an Assembly election.Mr Brown said many would have suggested that Alliance hit its electoral ceiling in  and firmly believes there is much more to come from his party locally.

But there is no attraction either to live in the isolated bubble of a disposable Northern Ireland, or in a political vacuum where unionism appears to have few ideas and little vision for a healthy society.Let’s have some good answers to the question, and a constructive conversation please, and one that won’t fizzle out in a few weeks.

But this led to bogus claims about the agreement having depended on EU membership or having guaranteed an open border. It did no such thing. There is a much more plausible case to be made that it was a breach of the spirit of the deal, which was agreed at a time when no-one envisaged either party leaving the EU, but that is a dferent argument..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Dermot Nesbitt, on the opposite page , accuses the British and Irish governments of having failed to hold Sinn Fein to account for its failure to recognise the legitimacy of Northern Ireland, which was at the core of the agreement and the consent principle.Mr Nesbitt’s comments are all the more signicant given that he was on the moderate wing of unionism, and he helped the Ulster Unionist Party during their negotiations towards it.As Mr Nesbitt says, the failure of the two governments is all the greater given that they singled out the DUP forcriticism recently, something they have never shown any inclination of doing to Sinn Fein, which collapsed power-sharing.The temptation to accede to all Sinn Fein’s demands and restore Stormont on that basis is, naturally, great, for all other parties, yet it will only be a short-term fixso.If the party not only fails to recognise Northern Ireland in its rhetoric, but follows a de-stabilising course of politics in apparent pursuit of that refusal, then at the very least there is a duty on the UK government to call it out.We know that the Irish government simply will not do this. In fact, Dublin ultimately seems to share or adopt SF demands.But for London to stay mute is a grave dereliction of its responsibilities.• Demot Nesbitt: Shame on the two governments©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

politicians grappled with the growth of the internet, senior government ministers were alarmed by the professionalism of Sinn F#in#s website.Among filed declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast is a confidential minute of an April ,  meeting of the Security Information Group of senior civil servants and military commanders involved in counter-terrorism.The minute said that information on the security force deployment in Northern Ireland had been found on “the Sinn Féin site on the internet” and that in response the Home Office had asked the department to “explore the possibility of using the internet to get the NIO message across”.It went on: “The meeting noted that Sinn Féin was using the internet to good advantage. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog

example, could be read on the internet before it was on sale at retail outlets.”Referring to the suggestions of using the internet to push “good news stories” from the NIO and “ministerial soundbites”, Brigadier Strudley said that “dedicated resources might be required and possibly the formation of a committee to take the work forward”.Prior to the meeting, Home Office minister David Maclean had written a letter to fellow ministers Sir Nicholas Soames and Sir John Wheeler to say that he had come across the Sinn Féin material “freely available on the internet”.He said that he had done so while recently visiting a police computer crime squad where “amongst the unsavoury nasties on the internet were these very professionally produced pages apparently showing our complete deployment in Northern Ireland”.He added that “it horries me to find such dangerous and nasty propaganda on the internet.“When we add the other crimes and child pornography the police have to deal with, then the time for some sort of control is fast approaching.”In response, Sir John said: “I find it horric that such propaganda is available on the internet, particularly, detailed maps of all British forces in the ious towns as well as helicopter bases.“I very much support your view that, as the internet has  million American users and  million British users, we should use it effectively to get our own message across.”Declassied Files: Protestants starting to thank God for paramilitaries, Paisley told NIO Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

Mr Chilcot asked that the minute “be treated with particular care at this sensitive time”.By , Mr McNamara had been shadow Northern Ireland secretary for five years – an unusually long period in such a role. He was famously a fervent Irish nationalist, but opposed to the IRA’s campaign of violence.Sir John ChilcotDuring a meeting which went on late into the evening Mr McNamara outlined a philosophy whereby the principle of consent would not openly be removed, yet preparations for Irish unity would be made without the consent of Northern Ireland’s inhabitants.According to Mr Chilcot’s minute, Mr McNamara “said the essence of the position of an incoming Labour government would be to honour fully and wholeheartedly their commitment to see the three-stranded talks process go forward but that he personally doubted whether it had much prospect of success and thatit failed then the main policy thrust would turn towards North South harmonisation with the implicationthat the unionists would need to be cooperative in the talks processthey were to avoid the thrust of policy turning in the direction of ‘towards a united Ireland’. “Naturally the consent principle would hold but preparatory policies to encourage eventual unication need not and would not be impeded by the absence of that consent in the short to medium term.”Mr Chilcot said he “thought Mr McNamara was uncomfortable with my direct reference to and quotation from Mr Kinnock’s press conference at the Irish Embassy and that while his head, and party solidarity and loyalty, lead to the position he enunciated very clearly in the House of Commons on  March, his heart tugs him back to ‘towards a united Ireland’ and to the adoption and implementation of policies which the government would initiate and lead in both the economic and social spheres without the frustration and uncertainty which he clearly associates with the political development process”.Mr Chilcot said that in expressing pessimism about the likelihood of the talks succeeding and in envisaging a situation where moves were made towards harmonising policies across the border, Mr McNamara “echoed what both Mr Haughey and Mr Reynolds had indicated privately”.However, Mr McNamara was said to have “confirmed the very hard line on dealings with Sinn Féin and the Provisionals which he and Mr Kinnock have enunciated”.He said that he would want to see an end to the broadcasting ban on Sinn Féin and the transfer to Northern Ireland prisons of republican prisoners in Great Britain.Declassied Files: Alarm in  at Sinn Féin’s use of the internet Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"When Mr Chilcot asked him whether he would see those gestures being linked to movement by the IRA, Mr Chilcot said: “I think the thought was new and perhaps a dficult one for him”.The Labour frontbencher said he would espouse “total and complete rejection of any moves – eg. in terms of the legislative process, or the setting up of a Select Committee for Northern Ireland Affairs – which had any tinge of integrationism.“It was fundamental to his position to strengthen and harmonise all-Ireland matters, while resisting the blurring of Northern Ireland’s separate identity of that of either party of Great Britain.”On security, Mr Chilcot said that he found Mr McNamara “very ready to accept the points suggested in the briefing”. Mr McNamara said “he had not wanted and still did not want in advance of taking office to be given inside information or any detailed assessment of the situation or on any particular issue. There was always the dficulty of remembering what was to be kept secret and what [not] and he emphasised to me his concern to keep secrets secret.”Although Mr McNamara was one of the most devout Catholic MPs, he told Mr Chilcot that he “would wish so far as practicable to advance the course of integrated education while recognising the hostility of the Catholic Church to it” and suggested Catholic schools would “have to choose between % state funding, or the retention of something like the existing degree of control by the hierarchy”.In the end, Labour lost the  election and when Tony Blair became Labour leader in  he replaced Mr McNamara with Mo Mowlam.try catch  TrendingGame of Thrones NI actor Andrew Dunbar dies suddenlyThe full list of the  Northern Ireland New Yearrsquos

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after she was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni, on Monday.And the psychologist who assessed the woman as part of her defence case, Dr Christine Tizzard, said she was concerned the trial had not fully considered that she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder .She told the : ldquoThe salient point is that she was diagnosed with PTSD.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a -

by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Break-in at Spar store condemnedBilly Wright and Robin Jackson were ‘state agents’ claims BBC documentaryNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsTraffic and TravelTraffic update -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important.
