Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

On weekends he would travel into Manhattan to watch shows by the likes of glam-rock veterans the New York Dolls and aspiring punk poet Patti Smith. That summer, he rented an apartment in the West Village and began working as an assistant to a commercial photographer, a job that allowed him to “go out every night and take photographs”.That April, the Ramones released their eponymous debut album, the first signal of the seismic shift in pop culture that was punk. Green was a clued-up music fan with a camera in the right place at exactly the right time. He began shooting in venues like CBGB on the Bowery, where a scene was coalescing around groups such as the Ramones, Television, Blondie and Talking Heads. Green took his photos to the music paper New York Rocker, he says. “The editor, Alan Betrock, gave me my first assignment, which was to photograph this young rockabilly-obsessed singer, Robert Gordon. It all started from there.”It has taken 44 years for Green’s monochrome photographs of New York’s punk and post-punk scene to see the light of day with the publication of When Midnight Comes Around. It is a book filled with familiar faces – Smith, Joey Ramone, Richard Hell, Johnny Thunders – and now legendary and long-gone places such as CBGB, Max’s Kansas City and the Bottom Line. What sets it apart is the sense that Green was both an insider – for a time, he shared an apartment with Sylvain Sylvain of the New York Dolls – and an acute social observer who understood that he was witnessing an important pop-cultural moment driven by outsiders and misfits.His photographs of the soon-to-be-famous are punctuated by portraits of anonymous iniduals who caught his eye with their style or attitude. The result is a democratic portrait of an emerging New York punk scene that looks both distant and timeless.“I thought what I was doing was a kind of social documentary. I had seen Diane Arbus’s work and would later take a class with Lisette Model, who had taught Arbus. I think this accounts for my straight-on approach, but also my desire to shoot people who weren’t famous,” he says. “Also, I was never a fan of live photography. I preferred to turn away from the stage and look at what was going on around me.”The book opens with two scene-setting shots: a pair of bohemian-looking women selling secondhand clothes on a sidewalk in Manhattan’s East Village and a ground-level view of the sleazy porn cinemas that once dotted the streets on Times Square. This is another New York, grittier and edgy, a city close to financial bankruptcy. Its more neglected neighbourhoods, where rents were low and crime rates high, drew artists and musicians attuned to an emerging punk aesthetic that fed off and was energised by the surrounding seediness. “The lower East Side is trendy now, but back then I didn’t go there unless I really had to. Even the little kids there were tough and threatening.”Green’s early photographs from 197677 evoke the ad-hoc atmosphere of what was then a small, evolving downtown scene, just as his later ones reflect the shift towards a more self-consciously stylish milieu as punk mutated into post-punk, the music becoming more arty and angular. Alongside New York scenesters such as Anya Phillips, co-founder of the Mudd Club, Green also snapped a young, dapper Tom Waits, a lonesome-looking Alex Chilton in CBGB, and Lou Reed with Andy Warhol at an early solo show by erstwhile New York Doll David Johansen at the Bottom Line.“People were there in those clubs to be noticed,” he says, “so it was never that difficult to get access. Despite the look of everyone – cool, detached, tough – it was a fairly friendly scene.”It is the unknown faces that most intrigue. Some, like Babette and Katrina, denizens of the Chelsea Hotel, he remembers well: “They were both French and ‘danced’ for a living.” The names of others, he cannot recall. In one photo, taken in what looks like someone’s kitchen, a young Green, looking smart in a crisp white shirt, stands next to Sylvain Sylvain and two members of his post-New York Dolls group, the Criminals. I know it’s him, because Green told me there are no identifying captions in the book.“Given that many of the people who can’t be identified were not famous, it democratises the series by giving everyone the same treatment,” he explains. “I would rather people have too little information than too much. It means the pictures stand up on their own.”For a short time in the early 80s, Green worked as a jobbing music photographer, shooting album covers for Robert Gordon and Link Wray as well as editorials for Rolling Stone, Downbeat and SoHo Weekly News. In 1986, he left the city and attended graduate school a few hours north of the city in an attempt “to really rethink and reinvestigate photography anew”. One of his teachers was Stephen Shore, under whose influence his practice shifted towards landscape and the built environment.Green is now an academic and an established photographer, with three other photobooks and his work bought by several US art institutions. He looks back on his punk photographs with fondness and a degree of melancholy. “So many people in the book have died or grown so much older,” he says. “It was my youth, it was my music, and so much of me is tied up in that work that it was quite a challenge to immerse myself in it.”Yet he claims to only have one regret about that period: “Why the hell didn’t I photograph the really seedy bathroom in CBGB?”• When Midnight Comes Around is published by StanleyBarker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559e117af990b96574fcaff70548945ae20f8c70/0_461_3075_1845/master/3075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a44b0a5b767cdb26b99848923c7b268","title":"great british art quiz pier arts centre orkney","story":"The Pier Arts Centre in Orkney sets today’s quiz – which enables you to explore the art collections of museums closed due to Covid-19 while answering a few brain-teasersThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

It has also agreed an increase of $110m (£90m) on a credit facility, and a further $45m in UK government-backed loans to support large businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis.“Cineworld, as always, greatly believes in the theatrical experience and is fully committed to be the best place to watch a movie,” the company said. “Cineworld\u0026nbspis excited by the great movie line-up to follow the reopening of cinemas, starting with the highly anticipated new Chris Nolan movie Tenet and immediately after that with Mulan, a new Disney adventure movie.”Rival Vue, one of Europe’s largest cinema operators, has also said it intends to reopen in July with measures including physically isolating family groups and staggering film times to reduce crowding.Vue has previously said other measures would include controlling entrances and exits and reducing the overall capacity of each film screening.In Berlin, one theatre ripped out many seats to ensure safe distancing between members of the audience.

It says no one has been chosen for redundancy because of their whistleblowing or trade union activities.The company says those affected are in central London, where there has been a “significant downturn” in business and where cycle and walking couriers mainly work.The dispute escalated on Wednesday after IWGB members at the company voted to strike in protest at the redundancies and over safety issues in transporting medical samples, according to the union.TDL has more than 150 couriers, about half of whom are members of the IWGB. There have been previous disputes at the company in which a number of those now likely to lose their jobs were participants.In legal arguments submitted to the employment tribunal on behalf of the claimants, lawyers said: “The claimants all feel victimised for daring to take part in trade union activities and these decisions will have terrible consequences on their private and family lives.“Many of the claimants have children to support and wonder how they will be able to adequately support them if they are dismissed and unable to find a job.”TDS said in a statement: “It’s exceptionally disappointing that a minority of our couriers have voted to strike in the midst of this pandemic. The IWGB union, which represents TDL’s 157-strong courier workforce, balloted its 80 members, 46 of whom voted to strike, on a number of unfounded allegations relating to proposed redundancies and courier health and safety, which TDL does not recognise or accept.“Like many organisations across the country who are taking action to ensure their survival and future sustainability, TDL is making adjustments as a result of the pandemic, and is proposing to make its 10-person pushbike and walking courier fleet redundant.“This is due to a very significant downturn in the inner London postcodes in which they operate. Proposed redundancies are not a consideration ever made lightly, even in these exceptional circumstances. These proposals are currently subject to consultation with the 10 couriers and no decision has been made.”\u0026nbsp“We are working closely with our couriers and will continue to do so. We are absolutely committed to ensuring there will be no disruption to our normal service.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a47ef89cff2a21c16a9c2b201c9b39f0acd515/0_61_2785_1671/master/2785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=699c9a308df4843b0cdee987d6c78214","title":"fashion retailer boohoo buys out stake in pretty little thing","story":"Boohoo has bought out a minority stake in its Pretty Little Thing brand for more than £260m just days after criticism over a potential deal.The company said the acquisition would create “significant value for the group’s shareholders” and was an “important further step towards achieving its vision to lead the fashion e-commerce market globally by accelerating full ownership of a brand that is in high growth with enormous growth potential ahead of it”.The deal appears to be an attempt to draw a line under criticism from the hedge fund investor ShadowFall, which this week published a note suggesting that a recent £200m fundraising effort by Boohoo could be handed over in idends or buyout costs to Umar Kamani.Matthew Earl, the head of ShadowFall, who is known at the “Dark Destroyer” for the effect his research can have on companies’ share prices, said that in his view the PLT buyout announced on Thursday “raises more questions”.“Above all, this is another example of the Kamani family reducing its ownership in the company largely using cash,” Earl said.He questioned the relatively low valuation placed on the stake in PLT in the deal, in relation to the value of the group.Earl also said that shareholders were likely to be bemused by Boohoo spending the proceeds of its £200m share placing on the buyout of PLT, when a detailed statement put out on Tuesday confirmed earlier statements that the funds would be used “to take advantage of numerous opportunities” in the global fashion industry. Boohoo did not mention the potential fast-forwarding of acquiring the PLT stake.“To raise the money, suggesting that opportunities may emerge, but with no specific targets and then to buy PLT two years early is perplexing,” Earl said.Boohoo said that after the PLT acquisition it retained a strong balance sheet that would enable it to continue disrupting the fashion industry and take advantage of “numerous M\u0026ampA opportunities that are likely to emerge in the global fashion industry over the coming months”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab57d4af7a835c9d7d876ed3dce811c40547b7e2/0_365_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef8ec404ea80ebfe08c66a0357cd05c4","title":"gsk coronavirus vaccine booster 2021 glaxosmithkline","story":"World’s largest vaccine maker in talks with governments over manufacturing expansionGlaxoSmithKline plans to produce 1bn doses of vaccine efficacy boosters, or adjuvants, next year for use in Covid-19 treatment.The world’s largest vaccine maker said it was in talks with governments to back a manufacturing expansion that would help to scale up production of future vaccines for Covid-19.It gave no indication of costs, saying only that production would take place at sites in Europe and North America and that it would reinvest any profit into coronavirus research and preparation for future pandemics.GSK is working on its own Covid-19 vaccine with the French drugmaker Sanofi, one of the many projects to counter the respiratory illness that currently has no treatment and has killed about 350,000 people.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work.Adjuvants, an area where GSK leads many of its peers, have been shown to create a stronger and longer-lasting immunity against infections and allow for lower dosing of the protein in a vaccine, making way for higher-volume production.“We believe that more than one vaccine will be needed to address this global pandemic and we are working with partners around the world to do so,” said the GSK global vaccines president, Roger Connor.Experts have predicted a successful vaccine will take more than a year to develop and companies and governments are pouring money into dozens of programmes as their best hope of allowing a durable escape from lockdowns and getting economies expanding again.The US last week secured almost a third of the first 1bn doses planned for AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine by pledging up to $1.2bn.GSK said making its adjuvant available to the world’s poorest countries would be a key part of its efforts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7716fd94c4bba4816e53829504dedd6ac6f42cde/0_77_1173_704/master/1173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c792f3e2cfa6be4a6c41e90b3761343","title":"ryanair worst airline for flight cancellation refunds finds which uk customers coronavirus","story":"Ryanair is the worst major airline for refunding British customers whose flights have been cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than eight out of 10 people still waiting for their money back, according to figures from Which?.Ryanair has been widely accused of confusing customers, with numerous changes to its approach to refunds and vouchers.“Despite initially telling customers it was processing refunds at the beginning of the crisis, customers reported that Ryanair provided refund forms that didn’t work, before attempting to force vouchers on passengers who had specifically requested refunds. It also repeatedly changed the timeframe for receiving a refund, suggesting at one point customers may have to wait up to 12 months for their money back,” Which? said.Correspondence seen by the ’s consumer champions team also reveals how some Ryanair customers are being told that refunds are not possible because of physical distancing and payment systems rules.In one online chat, a Ryanair representative told a customer: “Our claims and refunds team should do the refund procedures but they are working from home from where they are not allowed to process any refunds due to payment security regulations.”In mid-May, the Civil Aviation Authority warned airlines that the law was clear and that they had to offer refunds if requested, rather than offering a voucher or credit note.The CAA said: “Under the law, consumers are entitled to receive a refund for their cancelled flights, despite the challenges the industry is currently facing … it is important that consumers are given a clear option to request a cash refund without unnecessary barriers.”In a statement, Ryanair said it would offer refunds – but customers may have to wait until the coronavirus crisis was over.“The process time for cash refunds is taking longer due to the fact we are having to process 10,000 times the usual volume of cancellations and have fewer staff available due to social distancing measures,” the airline said.Easyjet added: “Customers may request a refund by submitting a claim in writing via a dedicated refund webform, online.

infection rate too high second wave","story":"Test and tracing is launching today but, as the lockdown eases, it will need to be massively stepped up to have a significant impactWe all now know the basics – the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to.\u0026nbspIf it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially.\u0026nbspIf it is less than 1.0 it will eventually disappear.\u0026nbspThere are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions and the “effective R” or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus.\u0026nbspWe calculate the R in several ways.\u0026nbspWhat it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths.\u0026nbspThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time but these take a week or two to process and report.\u0026nbspThus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers.The amount of virus each inidual\u0026nbspcarries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others – at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services – is important too.\u0026nbspThus, one man may have infected more than 90 clubgoers in South Korea, and one member of a choir in Washington State may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal.Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more.\u0026nbspThis is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0.\u0026nbspThe infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not drop precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.\u0026nbspThe epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards.\u0026nbspTo decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 – and no one thinks it has declined to that level.\u0026nbspAs Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: “A fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.”So where does this leave us over the next few months?\u0026nbspWith Re so close to 1.0 there are basically two options.\u0026nbspFirst, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people – bringing Re down further – so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China.\u0026nbspIt became clear from the prime minister’s announcement on 10 May on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus – guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus.\u0026nbspAs a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious.Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the “back to work and school” decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place.\u0026nbspIndoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly.\u0026nbspOn trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting.\u0026nbspAnd the use of face coverings should be the new normal – including at government press briefingsAnd travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions.\u0026nbspThere are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more gatherings and crowded trains, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to long-distance travel.Stabilising the epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine.\u0026nbspPerhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on.\u0026nbspBut when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is massively stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life. And all of this will guarantee more Covid-19 deaths in the UK.•\u0026nbspDavid Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3fa9b74dc62e4c72ea4bc30890b99c2546d806b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e2fe76b82214e7c45a03d3ddb68435f9","title":"postcard future life denmark after lockdown","story":"As the restrictions lift and we emerge blinking from our homes, it’s possible to believe that life will be good againUnder the shade of umbrellas, pensioners eat cake at a cafe, children slosh cups of juice, and students clink beer bottles, smoking, laughing and talking loudly enough to be heard above the buzz of people who are now … everywhere.On 18 May, the doors of cafes, restaurants and shops were flung wide in Denmark and the high streets are bustling again. Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes).There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in “lanes”, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time. But Danes are happy to comply for the most part – if there are already four people buying ice-cream, they’ll just come back later.Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to lock down on 11 March. The borders were closed two days later and Denmark’s famous hygge was put to the test as Danes were forced to stay home (although no restrictions were placed on outdoor exercise). As a rule-abiding bunch, Danes trusted that the government had their best interests at heart and so did as they were told. Every Saturday during lockdown, locals flew the Danish flag in solidarity and instead of clapping for health workers, Denmark’s answer to TV choirmaster Gareth Malone led Daily Morgensang (Daily Morning Song) on TV station DR1 to keep morale up. And it worked. Prime minister Mette Frederiksen’s hard and fast coronavirus strategy paid off – in a country of 5.8 million, the number of Covid-19 deaths stands at just 563 at time of writing and infection rates are low (0.7).Curve duly flattened, Denmark was the first country in Europe to reopen primary schools – as well as kindergartens and day-care institutions – in mid-April, following the advice that young children were the least at risk. Some were nervous at the idea of sending small children out to test the water, but after five weeks of supposedly “working from home” with three kindergarteners, I was tempted. With work Zoom calls regularly gatecrashed by Elsa from Frozen and bare bottoms (lockdown brought out the nudist in my kids), my husband and I decided to go for it. Socialising young children is considered crucial in Denmark and as one psychologist friend put it: “We like the idea that children are brought up not only by their parents but by a whole society, including teachers, school friends, grandparents etc. They learn different perspectives from different relationships.” He added: “I also like the idea that I’m not the only one responsible for their development and wellbeing.” Danes worked out quickly that social distancing was impossible with young children, who essentially lick everything they see. Instead, kids stay in “protective bubbles” – keeping to their own zones in the playground in small groups and sticking with the same teacher. Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and no parents are allowed inside the school. There are no face masks – for pupils or teachers lessons are outside whenever possible, and handwashing is hourly (eczema flare-ups abound). Teachers sport hand-sanitiser sprays like cowboys in a weird western and all equipment is disinfected several times a day.Denmark’s schools started off with a two-metre social distancing rule, but this has now been reduced to one metre and dropped entirely for kindergarteners. From 18 May, kids aged 11-plus returned to school, and they were also separated into smaller groups. This has been a logistical challenge but teachers have already seen the better teacherchild ratio as beneficial to behaviour – and kids polled say they’re glad to be back, following the isolation of home schooling.Many adults, by contrast, are content to still be working from home (without distractions). Denmark was already renowned for its work-life balance, but lockdown life has highlighted the importance of flexibility for employees. Some office workers are returning to their desks a few days a week, but there’s a sense that employers can no longer demand the same presenteeism or demanding commutes as before. Meeting face to face isn’t always necessary and shaking hands – previously a stalwart of Danish etiquette, done with everyone from your GP to your dentist and every member of a social gathering – is now a thing of the past.I can live without handshakes. What I miss are hugs, from friends. Socialising online made many of us strangely intimate. We didn’t know when we’d next see each other and so we opened up, skipping the small talk. Once we were officially allowed to socialise again in small groups, it was strange at first, tuning into friends in real life and talking about things other than coronavirus. But after the initial awkwardness, it was … brilliant (and blurry. Sore heads all around the next day). When restaurants and bars reopened, we emerged, blinking, from our homes, conscious of trying to keep up the meaningful connections that were somehow easier and more frequent when “normal life” wasn’t in the way.Danes have now been advised that they can see and even hug grandparents again, but for those with very elderly relatives or in at risk groups, the isolation continues. Hospitals are coping, but the threat of coronavirus means that anyone admitted is tested for Covid-19 as a matter of course and no visitors are allowed. I don’t know when I’ll see family in the UK since borders are still closed to foreign visitors (with some exceptions). But for the majority of those living Danishly, the silence of lockdown has been a time to re-evaluate – to notice things, good and bad, take stock, break habits and start over. Many are relearning the delights of the Danish countryside, of slowing down, of looking after each other. And now, in Denmark, there’s a mood of optimism best summed up by the slogan det bliver godt igen – or “it will be good again”.• Helen Russell is the bestselling author of The Year of Living Danishly.

But since coronavirus hit, politics and business are thinking againTiming matters. Early 2020 saw an economic collapse the likes of which have not been seen in living memory. Growth has collapsed, unemployment has soared, poverty has increased.Yet in different circumstances the past few months would have been dominated by calls for countries to do more to cut carbon emissions. As 2019 drew to an end, everybody from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund\u0026nbspto the governor of the Bank of England was warning of the threat of global heating.A year of floods, hurricanes and bush fires had made a strong case for action to make economies more sustainable. What was lacking was a profound shock that would make change possible. Now we’ve had one.Governments are creating, borrowing and spending money like never before in peacetime, in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have the opportunity to reshape their economies in a way that would be consistent with preventing catastrophic increases in global temperatures. Businesses are already learning lessons from the lockdown, such as that modern technology no longer makes it essential for an executive to travel half way round the world for a business meeting, and that employees can be just as productive working from home as they can when sat in expensive set-piece city centre offices.The world has been here before, though, and there is no guarantee that an opportunity proffered will be an opportunity taken. One was certainly missed at the back end of the 2000s, when the banks nearly went bust. Supporters of a Green New Deal\u0026nbsp(of whom I was one) said governments should avert the possibility of a second Great Depression by investing in decarbonisation of their economies and programmes that would put people back to work by making their homes energy-efficient.Things look a bit different this time. The UK economy shrank by as much in March – when there was barely more than a week of lockdown – as it did in the whole of the 2008-9 recession. April’s number will be a lot worse, and recovery is going to be slow, even assuming there is no second wave of infections.During the financial crisis, the then Labour government took a stake in two of Britain’s high-street banks. This time, a Conservative government has effectively nationalised the railways, announced plans to support strategically important companies, and is paying the wages of more than 10 million workers.What’s more, it has been a case of money is no object. The UK is on course to borrow £300bn this year at dirt cheap interest rates. The Bank of England is creating money through its quantitative easing programme. The argument that a Green New Deal is unaffordable is still knocking around, but is much less powerful than it was a decade ago. Ministers can decide whether they want to do more than respond to the immediate crisis and they certainly have the power to shape the recovery by making demands of the companies they are supporting, if they choose to use it.Here the picture is mixed. Governments make all the right noises about sustainability, yet many of them have used the crisis as an excuse for relaxing or suspending environmental regulations in order to stimulate activity of any sort. Those who think action of global heating should be a matter for markets not governments see Covid-19 as an opportunity too.But only up to a point. For some, lockdown has provided a glimpse of what a sustainable economy might look like. For others – those who face losing their jobs in carbon-intensive sectors – that sort of future doesn’t look so attractive.Politics reflects this tension. If parties of the left sometimes seem less enthusiastic about a GND than they might be, it is because a lot of the people who vote for them like the idea of cheap flights and rely on their old banger to pay visits to their mum. No question, any transition to a greener, more sustainable economy will have to overcome not just active opposition but passive resistance from those who would like life to return to its pre-Covid-19 crisis state.One solution might be to trial in one of the UK’s big cities – Manchester or Glasgow, say – to see whether a GND creates jobs, cuts emissions and generates a new wave of profitable environmental innovation. Opponents of change don’t need to do anything they simply need to wait for inertia to kick in. Those who want a different sort of economy need to start somewhere. And they should start with a simple question: if not now, when?• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbcac3b6c6a50ac88d5c22f4a798279615911b9/453_589_3497_2099/master/3497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc017bfe7ffe4c96742260ff4062ff8","title":"share your photos of butterflies in the uk","story":"We want to see your photos of butterflies you have spotted around the country during the sunny weather Due to a combination of warmth and sunshine across the UK, butterflies have been spotted enjoying the good weather.If you have seen any near you, we’d like to see your photos.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

From Normal People to Angela Rayner, DIY bangs are the new normalAs our contact with the outside world shrinks to the size of a screen, once-private things have been pushed to the fore.Our bookshelves, formerly unseen by our co-workers, have become pregnant with meaning. Our tired faces, once optimised for the workplace with concealer and a fancy neckline, are beginning to crack after one too many Zoom meetings. For those of us working from home, headshots are the new hemlines.Then there is our hair: our rubbish, 10-week too-long hair that we can’t really improve without breaking the law – or at least a headband (although according to the Freelance Association of Hairdressers, clients are trying, “offering thousands of pounds” for an illicit trim). There has recently been further uproar over Dominic Raab’s plans to not open salons until July.Like so many successful things in 2020, the lockdown fringe began on social media and, also like so many things, was consolidated in Britain by the TV adaptation of Normal People. Connell’s silver chain might have spawned its own social media account and be “comparable to what James Dean did for the simple white T-shirt” (according to its costume designer), but so, too, has Marianne’s evolving fringe, which came with its own story arc – choppy when young, flourishing during her sexual prime, and so on – and now its own Instagram account, @Mariannesbangs, with 5,000 followers and counting. Earlier this month, Vanity Fair even published an essay in homage, called Fringe Watch. Sandra Kelly, the show’s hair designer, describes the online reaction to Marianne’s bangs as “Fringemania”.Still, a sharp, face-framing fringe on Zoom has become yet another impossible beauty standard to add to the list, and one that reflects self-improvement over pandemic restriction. While Bella Hadid cut hers in lockdown to match Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday with surprising deftness, and Anna Wintour seems to have a live-in hairdresser, it appears deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has chosen not to touch hers in her last television appearance on The Andrew Marr show, she had swept it artfully to one side.If hair has become a talking point of lockdown – and further proof that personal grooming is key to our welfare regardless of what is happening in the outside world (the re-opening of beauty salons in Italy this month allegedly outranked restaurants and shops in demand) – then DIY fringe cuts are a distillation of this new normal. Lengths vary, but the sentiment remains – a good fringe is proof that the wheels of professionalism are working nicely, even if they are coming off.We’re now 10 weeks into lockdown and well past the sweet spot of a recommended trim – “which is absolutely six to eight weeks”, according to Northwood, the man who coined and cultivated The Alexa (Chung) and The Claudia (Winkelman). As for the fringe, “it generally has a four-week shelf life. So if you went into lockdown with one, chances are you will have given yourself one trim already”. Northwood has been guiding clients such as Winkelman into cutting hers at home, using clips, point cutting and texturising scissors, videos of which have been uploaded on to social media. He says most of his work right now is on YouTube.“Cutting your hair now is mostly born out of necessity, and yes definitely a way to feel like you are in control, that you are not losing yourself,” says Rachael Gibson, a hair historian. To many people, the thought of going to a hair salon represents a return to normality after a long, destabilising period – in lieu of this, cutting our hair is as close as we can get.In these screen-focused times, and with mask-wearing soon possibly to be mandatory, could we be on the cusp of a Fringe Index?The pandemic has plunged us into deep uncertainty. The twist, says Northwood, is that people are also after fringes when salons re-open in July. “It seems that cutting your hair is one thing, but focusing on the fringe is more like a mood change, something that marks a new beginning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45b3be5649a41ef157503a7947148fce1c240a0a/0_216_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c37077b760e08652dd08d2f53840f0b7","title":"lockdown watch ice cube michael jordan","story":"The hip-hop legend has been winding back the clock to Vietnam and Michael Jordan’s heyday while working on a lockdown beardI’m with my wife, my son, Shareef, and my daughter, Karima, so there’s four in the house.

Its title over here was inelegantly rendered as Harry, He’s Here to Help, although I made a doomed attempt to popularise my own version: Harry Wants to Be Your Friend. After that, Moll had a number of credits, but nothing to live up to that picture, which promised us a film-maker with the style of Claude Chabrol.But now Moll has given us this audacious, witty and absorbing mystery thriller, a tale of adultery and amour fou with a gamey touch of the macabre – adapted by Moll and his longtime collaborator Gilles Marchand from the novel, Seules Les Bêtes by Colin Niel. It is about five people and their relationship with a sixth person who is to meet a terrifying, arbitrary fate. The movie introduces us in turn to these six overlapping lives, with ingenious point-of-view shifts that will explain an apparent oddity or anomaly in the previous scene and set us up for a rug-pull in the next, letting us in on a secret, then coolly pushing us away.The unhappy woman at the centre of this spider’s web is the wealthy and married Evelyne Ducat, whose business takes her to Sète in the south of France but whose lifestyle leaves her emotionally unsatisfied. She is played by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, and she has a great moment that requires her to give a feline smile of panicky, thin-lipped irritation at a lover, before unleashing the vengeful, petulant slap that is to seal her fate.Near where Evelyne she lives is a farm run by the morose Michel, terrifically played by veteran French character actor Denis Ménochet, a man radiating unhappiness, made grizzled and careworn by hard work, and the strain of keeping secrets. His wife, Alice, played with poignant emotional hurt by Laure Calamy (known for the Netflix TV comedy Call My Agent), is acquainted with nearby farmer Joseph (Damien Bonnard), a reclusive, difficult man, going through an emotional breakdown following the death of his adored mother. Then there is the beautiful, willowy Marion, played by Nadia Tereszkiewicz, who waits tables in Sète.Most mysteriously of all there is Armand, a young guy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, whom we see at the very beginning, cycling somewhere with a goat on his back – a sacrificial goat, perhaps? He is on his way to a local gang boss, Papa Sanou (Christian Ezan), who exerts a voodoo-ish influence and sums up the film’s philosophy by telling Armand: “Chance is stronger than you, idiot!” Poor Armand yearns to be rich and is still in love with a young woman who is the mother of his child but is now with a wealthy European. Armand talks about a “colonial debt”.These people provide the film’s constituent parts, which interlock like the workings of an intricate and malign musical box, creating dashes of melodrama, erotic obsession and even soap opera, and all superbly performed. In a way, each of these people occupies a short story, an inidual mini-film, but they all find themselves in the Venn-diagram overlap of fate, and their lives are made to dovetail like the films of Kieslowski’s Three Colours sequence of 1993-94, or Lucas Belvaux’s Trilogie of 2002.The words … Are Happy could go on the end of this film’s title. It is about human beings who are yearning desperately for something they don’t or can’t have – and are bashing at the prison bars of their own loneliness. The gnomic Papa Sanou says something else to the point: “Love is giving what you don’t have.” For many of these people love is about making demands, about trying to get the best of the bargain, or about trying to escape from a terrible bargain about their life’s direction that they don’t remember taking. They want to take love and have nothing to give in return.• Only the Animals is on Curzon Home Cinema from 29 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49fac91bba70afef0d9d457e47dc42aebdb0b90/0_106_3605_2164/master/3605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9215b2a35dc9cbfa2d70dd8dc25d8a15","title":"one punnet of strawberries 17 fantastic ways to use them from cake to ketchup","story":"There is more to strawberry recipes than just cream and sugar. Try pairing them with tomatoes, avocados, basil or harissa – if you dareIf you are not going to get out there and pick strawberries, the least you can do is eat them. Britain, farmers tell us, is facing a huge strawberry glut, thanks to the cancellation of major events such as Wimbledon (where 33 tonnes of strawberries were eaten last year), along with thousands of weddings and summer parties. As civic duties go, eating loads of strawberries isn’t that taxing, but they won’t sit around waiting for you to come up with new ways to serve them. Here are 17 delicious ideas to help you manage your personal stockpile.Maceration is step number one in a lot of the recipes below. At its simplest, macerating consists of hulling and halving a quantity of strawberries, tossing them in a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of sugar, then leaving them to sit in the fridge for half an hour or longer, but not long enough for them to turn into mush (meaning not overnight). Additions to the basic formula may include juice (orange or lemon), balsamic vinegar or alcohol.A basic strawberry tart, however, requires no maceration. You just make – or otherwise obtain – a shortcrust pastry case, fill it with whipped cream or pastry cream (I have had some success with this fail-safe Youtube tutorial by Thomas Joseph) and sink sliced strawberries into the top in an orderly spiral. You can get very fussy about sizing fruit for a neat look or, alternatively, not bother.Felicity Cloake’s strawberry tart is slightly more sophisticated, in that you have to be the sort of person who has rosewater to hand, but it is no more difficult to produce. It also contains a handy recipe-within-a-recipe, for an incredibly useful no-roll shortcrust pastry: you just press the mixture into the tin with the base of a cup.Yotam Ottolenghi’s strawberry and basil tart has an intriguing combination of strawberries, pistachios and basil-infused pastry cream. It also calls, thankfully, for store-bought puff pastry. Life may not be too short to make your own puff pastry, but the British summer definitely is.Strawberry shortcake is the traditional American way to keep on top of a strawberry glut, but Cloake’s reclaimed British version is excellent. As you will see, strawberry shortcakes are not cakes at all, but inidual assemblages of macerated strawberry, whipped cream and large biscuit. However, it is not uncommon in America to make one large one and slice it like a cake. The ingredients are the same, although the amounts might differ since you will probably want three layers for height. This version has the right proportions.In terms of actual cake, a strawberry and olive oil breakfast cake fits the bill, while Cassie Best’s strawberry and almond cheesecake sponge could be more accurately described as a sponge with “cheesecake blobs” in it.If you are like me, it might take you a while to get your head round the idea of using strawberries in salads, especially salads that sound as if they would be just as good without them. But let us not forget why we are here: to level Britain’s massive strawberry mountain before it collapses and buries us all.Here is what I would suggest: before you commit to a whole salad, try a few bites of the relevant flavour combinations first, to see if they work for you. Some will be delightful from the outset others may be tastes longer in the acquiring. I haven’t yet made Ottolenghi’s strawberry and tomato salad, but I did put a tomato and a strawberry in my mouth at the same time, and I can testify that they have a surprising affinity. Now I just need to convince my family.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends a strawberry and avocado salad, dressed with parmesan and a simple honey and lemon dressing. Mark Bittman’s strawberry and rocket is another rather startling combination to experiment with, as is Erin Clarke’s spinach and strawberry salad.I am always drawn to ice-cream recipes that don’t require an ice-cream maker, because I don’t own one and I don’t want one. This straightforward freezer recipe from Tom Hunt, chef at Poco in Bristol, has just four ingredients: strawberries, sugar, double cream and mascarpone. Mine didn’t turn out quite as rippled as his, but it disappeared very quickly.Jeremy Lee’s strawberry granita is simplicity itself, and should really be kept that way. As he says, cream is not required, “and the addition of a sprig of mint is absolutely forbidden.”A surplus of ripe strawberries can quickly turn into an embarrassment of overripe strawberries: bruised, soft, leaking. Compotes and preserves are the perfect way to rescue them. Strawberry jam is the most obvious route, and, as always, Felicity Cloake supplies the winnowed-down, optimal version. The major issue with strawberries is their lack of pectin, which causes jam to set. You need to add some, either in the from of other, pectin-rich fruit (lemons, say), or by using jam sugar, which already includes pectin.Strawberry compote is even simpler and keeps in the fridge for about two weeks. If you are looking for something more adventurous, try Ottolenghi’s frankly counter-intuitive strawberry and harissa ketchup, which he recommends as an accompaniment to grilled meats. After the thing with the tomato and the strawberry, I am willing to take his word for it.Strawberries are, for many people, just smoothies waiting to happen, either alone or in combination with numberless other fruits. You can begin with the basic format (strawberry, banana, orange juice) and experiment by adding elements –cranberries, chia seeds, oatmeal – until you realise you have gone too far. Then pull back a little.For something a bit stronger, Tom Hunt’s strawberry daiquiri is a respectable way to use up any final stray strawberries, or any leftover vodka. Hunt recommends macerating the berries in grappa beforehand, but if you don’t have grappa, a little more vodka makes a decent substitute. If you don’t have a proper blender, you can use a hand blender in a tall jug, although you might have to break up the ice a little first. If you haven’t got a jug, just wash out a large vase. You can see I really wanted to make this work. And it did, in the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9b18e0c3b32a6cf196508a8e8a458377763e021/0_338_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=653cdaf4183323f619829b21a124147e","title":"how to recreate the taste of summer from cream tea to the perfect pimms","story":"While we can’t go to Wimbledon, Notting Hill carnival or Glyndebourne this year, we can still enjoy the food and drink of our favourite eventsThis is set to be a summer like no other. All major events are cancelled and a holiday abroad looks doubtful. But all is not lost. Summer’s top pastimes nearly always involve food – picnics, ice cream, Pimm’s! – and there is no reason to bypass the season’s al fresco delights, even if you do end up consuming them on your window ledge.Maybe there won’t be big weddings this summer, maybe there won’t be carnival parades – but oh there will be burritos. Here, chefs show how to recreate the taste of summer from the comfort of your own home.Strawberries and cream should be self-explanatory – it is the Pimm’s that you will need to get right in order to replicate that Centre Court feeling. Mix one part Pimm’s with three parts lemonade and lots of ice. Add to a medley of cucumber, mint, orange and strawberries to serve.“Macerate the strawberries in the Pimm’s overnight,” says Jack Sotti, a brand ambassador at Diageo, which makes the gin-based fruit cup. “Get your mixer as cold as possible. This will mean it stays fizzier for longer and tastes way more delicious.” Sip while seated next to your local tennis courts – with gyms still closed, everyone who has ever picked up a racket is channelling their inner Andy Murray, so there is plenty to keep tennis fans entertained.Whether it is a souvlaki wrap, wood-fired pizza or a cheese toastie, food has become integral to the festival experience. Burgers are the “ultimate festival fuel” according to Craig Povoas, the director of Burger \u0026amp Beyond in London, which usually has a food truck at events such as Glastonbury. When making your own, “loosely hand-ball the mince and press directly on to a flat-top griddle”, he advises: “This sears and traps all the flavour.” For chips, Povoas says to use Maris Piper or King Edward potatoes, peeled and cut into sticks, then brined for 30 minutes in cold water and vinegar before cooking. Double fry to get that golden crunch: heat the oil to 160C (320F) and cook for three minutes, then drain on paper towels. Increase the oil temperature to 190C (375F) and fry for another four minutes. Alternatively, go veggie with another festival favourite: the burrito. James Leahy, who runs Burrito Joe in London, fries onions with garlic, cumin and fennel seeds for five minutes, then adds black turtle beans (soaked for 24 hours in water) and enough water to cover the mixture by 7cm (3in), before simmering for two hours. Then, in a separate pan, he adds oil, more onion, garlic, spring onions and spices (he uses smoked paprika and chipotle chilli in adobo) and fries until golden, before adding the beans and partially mashing everything while cooking for 15 minutes. To serve, he takes a warmed tortilla and tops with the beans, pico de gallo salsa, guacamole, cheese, coriander and sour cream, then rolls it up. “Warm the tortilla first,” says Leahy, “as this makes it more pliable when you wrap and helps stop it splitting.”Tom Kitchin’s recipe for battered haddock takes a bit of prep – but it is worth it. Put 250g plain white flour in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Add 125ml warm whole milk and 125ml sparkling mineral water and slowly whisk. Crumble over 3g fresh yeast and beat well to combine, then add a pinch of salt. Cover tightly with cling film and place in a warm spot for eight hours, whisking occasionally.When you are ready to cook, heat to 185C enough oil for deep-frying. Pat dry two haddock fillets (about 150g each, skinned), then season with salt and pepper. Lightly coat the fillets with flour, tapping off the excess. Give the batter a good stir, then dip in the fillets, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Add the fillets to the oil and fry for four minutes, or until golden brown. Serve immediately with tartare sauce and a lemon wedge. Wrap in newspaper if you must.August’s event has been cancelled for the first time since its inception in 1966. If you are already craving rice and peas, then it is time to start soaking those red kidney beans. “You must use dried beans,” says Brian Danclair, owner of Fish, Wings \u0026amp Tings in south London. “A lot of people take shortcuts and use a can, which is awful.”After an overnight soak, his recipe involves boiling the beans with some garlic and one scotch bonnet pepper. Once soft, add coconut milk, thyme, onions, more garlic, pumpkin, carrots and red peppers. Then add long grain rice and salt, to taste, and simmer until the rice is cooked. “My rice and peas is like a Christmas tree when it’s done!” says Danclair, whose dish works well as a meal in its own right, or alongside traditional accompaniments such as chicken or curried goat.Online searches for afternoon tea deliveries have surged during the lockdown, but the classic cream tea – scones, jam and clotted cream – is easy enough to make yourself.“It is best to eat scones on the same day they are baked,” says Chris Taylor, a course tutor at Bettys cookery school – not that this should be a problem during lockdown. His recipe for eight sultana scones calls for 250g plain flour, 1tsp baking powder, 100g butter (chilled and diced) and a pinch of salt, placed in a large bowl. Rub everything together using your fingertips, then stir in 50g caster sugar and 50g sultanas. Beat 1 egg with 90g buttermilk, then make a well in the flour mixture and pour in three-quarters of this mix. Using a dinner knife, gently cut the ingredients together until a soft dough starts to form. Knead this by hand, then roll out to approximately 3cm (1.2in) in depth. Cut into rounds, brush the tops with the remaining buttermilk mix and bake at 190C for 15-20 minutes, until well risen and golden brown.Proceed to argue to your heart’s content about whether jam or cream should be applied first. This year, soggy sandwiches just won’t cut it – not that they ever did at Glyndebourne. This year’s festival is cancelled, but, with restaurants also closed, posh picnics abound. Scott Paton, the chef at Àclèaf in Devon, warns against making sarnies in advance. “Tupperware up your basics and assemble them in situ,” he says. “Box up fresh crab mixed with mayo, lemon and herbs, take some good thick bread and make open sandwiches to order”.Tom Aikens, the head chef at Muse in London, suggests adding two different mustards to potato salad “for real oomph”. “I always use a French’s as well as a pommery grain mustard,” he says. “Then add sliced spring onions, chopped dill pickle and raw red onion”. Plus Hellmann’s mayonnaise and potatoes, of course.Don’t forget the dips – central to any good picnic spread. The chef Jason Atherton suggests a quick pistachio version, “which is not only delicious for crudités or crisps, but also smeared on bread and paired with smoked salmon or cured meats”. Blend 100g pistachios, 100g yogurt, 1 chopped chilli, 1 clove garlic (grated), 200g chopped coriander, the juice of 2 limes, 60ml extra virgin oil and sea salt to taste.Glyndebourne has issued its own tips – including downloadable backgrounds for recreating the festival with friends on Zoom – and the 2009 production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream is available to watch online. But if opera is not your thing, a good picnic blanket will suffice.Watching Dirty Dancing under the stars has become a summer tradition for some – and one that needn’t be thwarted by the current situation. All you need is a classic film and a few cinema snacks. Popcorn is easy – heat kernels and oil in a lidded pan and wait for them to stop popping – but the warm weather is as good an excuse as any for ice-cream. Theo Randall, the chef at the InterContinental hotel in London, makes vegan coconut ice-cream by heating 400ml coconut cream and 400ml coconut milk in a pan with 100g caster sugar and 60ml maple syrup. Blend this well, then take it off the heat. Transfer to a fridge and leave overnight. When cold, place into an ice-cream maker for 30 minutes – or place in a shallow container and put in the freezer for 3-4 hours, stirring every 30 minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa6dd3a92b055ce8759fd8b089e7c931b95ee1b/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c6d8ce964a36cea2d478882a157ff7","title":"nathan jones returns as manager of luton town with repaired differences","story":"Nathan Jones has been reappointed as manager at Luton, just 16 months after leaving the club for Stoke.Having announced former boss Graeme Jones was leaving the Championship club during April as a means of reducing costs during the hiatus caused by the coronavirus crisis, the Welshman has been confirmed as successor on his 47th birthday.Jones had a brief spell at Kenilworth Road as a player in mid-1990s and enjoyed success as manager there between 2016 and 2019. The club was well placed for promotion to the Championship when he left for Stoke in January 2019 against the Luton hierarchy’s wishes.That ill-fated reign at the bet365 Stadium came to an end in November with Stoke second-bottom of the second tier. Jones will be assisted by Mick Harford, who as caretaker helped finish the job of gaining promotion from League One. “Everyone knows exactly what we thought about Nathan when he left for Stoke – we hardly made our disappointment a secret,” said the Luton CEO Gary Sweet.“Clearly, we couldn’t move forward without those issues being mostly corrected and over time, with the board, this has been done.

The Rapid Support Forces have been accused of atrocities in Darfur. Hemedti has denied any involvement in attacks on civilians.The UN denied applying pressure. “The UN secretariat and special adviser Haysom absolutely respect the right of these parties to make this decision without any pressure,” said spokesperson Ferhan Haq."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a79babf6e87c9c7a7cfaf5825cf6791ef86de2d/0_30_2384_1431/master/2384.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ba09c4ba00be57ad33b108847f9bf5fb","title":"start slow wear what you like watch out for zombies a beginners guide to running","story":"Missing your pre-lockdown workout? With gyms, pools and squash courts still closed, there’s a replacement right outside your door. Experienced runners explain how to get started – and stay motivatedThe gyms, pools and squash courts are shut. Joe Wicks is showing you how to get fit in your living room, but really all you want to do is get out of your living room. Now is the time to go for a run.If you are worried you’re not a running type, don’t be. I wasn’t either until I decided that I didn’t feel safe going to the gym in mid-March. Eight weeks later, I finished my first half-hour run, covering an apparently respectable 4.83km in the process. Almost anyone can be a runner, it turns out. So why not give it a try?The great thing about running is that you don’t need membership of a fancy club, expensive equipment or a qualified coach. But you do have to get some stuff: a good pair of shoes is non-negotiable, as is a sports bra if you need one.You don’t need to go wild for these things: yes, £200 will get you the pair of shoes that helped Eliud Kipchoge run the first sub-two-hour marathon, but beginners can settle for something much cheaper. But do resist the urge to just whack on the pair of throwback Nikes you bought for fashion purposes last year.“For people who are starting out, it’s important not to get bogged down in the kit, and actually think about the action of running,” says Anna Harding, the host of YouTube’s the Running Channel. “But I would suggest investing in a new pair of specific running trainers, and, for women, a sports bra. You don’t know the state of your old shoes, and it’s important to take care of your feet and knees. Other than that, though, wear what you feel good in.”When you first hit the road, you need to run slowly. Really slowly. So slowly you feel silly because of how slowly you are running. Slow enough that you’re pretty sure you could overtake yourself at a brisk walk.The point of running is endurance, and the most important thing to do is to make sure that you keep your heart rate elevated for the entire period of every training run. That means, especially at the beginning, erring on the side of caution: if you run slowly and find yourself barely breaking a sweat 20 minutes in, then you can speed up, but if you go too fast at the start, those last five minutes are going to be tough.“Start slow” also applies to how you should build up stamina over the first few weeks and months of your run. Thankfully, there is a best-in-class option here: the Couch to 5k programme, originally created by Josh Clark, an American software designer, in 1996. The idea is simple: run three times a week for eight weeks, beginning with sessions that involve more walking than actual running, and ending with 30 minutes of non-stop jogging.Your first session sees you running for a minute then walking for 90 seconds, and repeating the pattern eight times – enough to get an elevated heart rate for 20 minutes, and to get a solid eight minutes of actual running in. Four weeks later, the running has increased to three sets of five minutes, separated by three minutes of walking. And at the end of week five, the training wheels come off, and you run for a full 20 minutes non-stop.When I first tried to become a runner, in 2009, I would manually create those routines, booting up GarageBand on an old laptop and recording myself saying “run” and “walk” over the top of whatever I wanted to listen to, then loading it on to an iPod Shuffle. No wonder I didn’t stick with it. These days, it’s easier: the NHS has produced a podcast and app that automatically coaches you through the first nine weeks of your run.Some people think I’m daft for running to podcasts, wondering how on earth I can get into a good rhythm while catching up on Today in Focus. Sometimes, I think they’re nuts for running to music: no matter how good a tune is, it’s not distracting enough to save me from getting a bit bored 20 minutes in.If you want something more active still, you could try Zombies, Run! The app, which first launched eight years ago, lets you play through audio adventures timed to encourage and motivate you throughout a workout. A stand-alone couch-to-5k version can accompany you right from the start.“I started running when I was 20 or 21, and when we started Zombies, Run!, I was 28 or 29. Now I’m 37,” says Adrian Hon, the app’s co-creator. “I was a runner at that point, but I intensely remember the experience of not being a good runner. It came to me hard.”No one cares how sweaty you are, whether the top you run in is too bright or how fast or slow you’re going. So don’t worry about it. “A lot of the advertising, marketing and branding around running is incredibly unhelpful,” Hon says, “because it makes people think that a runner is some athletic supercharged person in Nike gear who doesn’t sweat. People get really self-conscious about that, and they get embarrassed. But no one gives a shit. Really: no one gives a shit what you look like.”Pavement space is at a bit of a premium right now, and in some places, that has led to hard feelings between runners, walkers and cyclists – not to mention the drivers who still get the majority of the road.“It has certainly become more of an obstacle course as we try to maintain the two-metre distance,” Harding says. “And I think as runners we are getting a little bit of side-eye from pedestrians, perhaps because of some reports suggesting that runners aren’t adhering to physical distancing.”It isn’t all negative, says Hon. “Obviously, there are more people running. Which is nice in some ways – you feel like you’ve got company. But it’s also tricky you’re having to weave in between people.“It’s a bit of a game: how do I maintain physical distancing while running? But there’s a happy medium, and there can occasionally just be too many people trying to share one fairly thin pavement. You’ve got to be very forgiving. It’s hard – sometimes I get annoyed when people run close to me. But risk is, I think, not as high as many other activities.”There are an awful lot of services that will track your stats, engage in virtual races or let you join a global community of runners. But before you jump in, remember why you’re running. It’s probably not to be the fastest among your friends, and if you’re not careful, such features can be more dispiriting than motivating.“People react to this stuff differently. In general, it is quite motivating to see yourself get faster, and to see yourself run further,” says Hon. “But when you have this social-media stuff … I think people are just too different. It becomes hard for it to be interesting or useful. Some people may like it, but the problem is that for most people, unless all their friends are runners, their range of abilities are all over the place.”Harding agrees: “The first thing to overcome is pride. For a lot of people, they’ll either compare themselves with where they used to be or to their friends who are running, or have been running a while.”“Motivation is something that will hit you during your early stages of running,” Harding says, “and continue to hit you after your running journey. And so that first day of ‘I really don’t fancy it today’ is one to overcome. But to steal a slogan from a well-known brand … just do it. You will genuinely feel better. I have never gone for a run and regretted it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25273b6341cfb9e538ae6f0d6ee78737016b41ec/0_344_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9bbb8971c0831ed99689b6bdca83761d","title":"zoom shabbat unexpected joy","story":"Shabbat for me used to mean a break from screens, but as I drop into synagogues all over North America, I’m reminded we’re all in this together Before the pandemic, Shabbat for me meant a break from screens. My synagogue, housed in a century-old building on a residential street in a quiet Toronto neighbourhood, observes the ancient laws that prohibit the use of technology on the Sabbath. A few Saturdays a month, I used to dress up, walk to shul (synagogue), and leave the frenetic demands of the secular, wired world behind. Since the pandemic shut the doors to my synagogue, I reluctantly turned to online shul to fill the void. Shabbat by Zoom, it turns out, is unexpectedly nourishing. Last month, the leaders of the conservative movement of Judaism gave rabbis the green light to livestream on Shabbat. Thousands of Jews around the world are just now discovering the joy of virtual worship, known to more liberal Jews for years. In fact, Zoom Shabbat has some distinct advantages over in-real-life congregation. If a sermon is boring, I’ll hop over to a different one. If I don’t like the voice of one cantor, I’ll close the tab and find another. Attendance is anonymous. No one notices if you show up late or leave early. I’ve dropped into synagogues all over North America.Virtual shul helps me mark the passing of time. Because I no longer drop my kids off to school or ride the subway to work, the days tend blend into each other. Virtual shul helps make Shabbat morning feel special. On Saturdays, we sleep in. My husband works on a cryptic crossword. Mid-morning, I recite Shabbat prayers with other people, just like before the pandemic, only now I don’t dress up or leave the house. I open my laptop at my kitchen table in my yoga pants, or sometimes in bed. My seven-year-old daughter colours beside me, and the two of us sing along to familiar melodies.Something else I like about livestream shul: it can be more intimate than in real life. You’re invited inside the private living rooms and offices of clergy where you can see their art, bookshelves and furniture. When the cantor Julia Cadrain, from Central Synagogue on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, sings from her apartment with a guitar on her lap in front of a wall of hanging plants, I feel like her personal guest. Sometimes her toddler joins her.I avoid the congregations that require Zoom password, which can lead to awkward situations. On a recent Saturday morning, I logged into a service held by Romemu, a progressive congregation on the Upper West Side, and in one of the little Zoom boxes, I saw the face of an old high school friend I hadn’t seen for over 20 years. I wondered if he’d seen me, if my hair looked OK, if I should follow up with an email. Flummoxed, I quickly logged off.If I’m lucky, I’ll stumble upon the bar or bat mitzvah of a stranger. Bar or bat mitzvahs are my preferred genre of reality television in the age of Covid-19. Inevitably, I cry from start to finish. I admire how, in the face of a disappointment, the kid, wearing fancy clothes, in the company of just immediate family, with a scroll placed on a dining room table, found a way to create a meaningful ritual. If she can do that, I think, maybe I can survive this, too. Sometimes the faces of the grandparents are Zoomed in from Florida, their knickknacks proudly displayed on shelves behind them. Captured on the screen is the sadness of the pandemic, the forced separation of grandparents from their grandkids, but it’s also an act of hope: despite the circumstances, the Jewish tradition is being passed from one generation to the next.When this is over, will I go back to attending synagogue in real life, or will my new virtual habit satisfy my needs? I’m not sure. Thousands of years ago, when Judaism shifted from being a temple-based religion to a bunch of communities spread out across the diaspora, synagogue ritual was invented as a kind of placeholder, until the temple in Jerusalem can be rebuilt. What we’re witnessing now is another great adaptation.I still miss my old synagogue. I miss the sound of voices singing together in spontaneous harmony. I miss the drama of the wrapped-up Torah scroll processing up and down the aisle and I miss the warm, wood-walled room that holds many happy memories. But Zoom Shabbat will do until the real thing comes back. Shabbat gives the week a rhythm. There’s a crescendo leading to Shabbat and a bittersweet denouement when it’s over. Without it, I’d be lost. Even though we can’t congregate, even though we can’t meet, Zoom shul reminds me that we’re all in this together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3305b6524f9cbb7232423dd361344b478390872/0_0_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f51c3e44df093e26fa6cc9117d22aeb","title":"bbc switches emily maitlis in newsnight episode over cummings remarks","story":"Katie Razzall stepped in after BBC reprimanded host over ‘breach of impartiality rules’Emily Maitlis was replaced as host of Wednesday night’s episode of Newsnight by another member of the programme’s team after BBC bosses reprimanded her over a monologue in which she attacked the government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.News bosses at the corporation said the BBC2 programme’s lead presenter breached impartiality rules with her opening remarks on Tuesday night. She had been due to host the show on Wednesday night, but the Newsnight reporter Katie Razzall presented it instead.Maitlis later tweeted she had “asked for the night off”.Amid growing criticism of the reprimand, Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, wrote on Twitter that Maitlis “hasn’t been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement”.In the monologue Maitlis told viewers: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.“The longer ministers and the prime minister insist he worked within them, the more likely the angry response to the scandal is likely to be … He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can flout them.”Talking of Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement: “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it.”Maitlis finished the programme by telling viewers: “I’ll be back tomorrow.” Clips of the sequence went viral on social media, attracting millions of views – many more than tune in to Newsnight on a typical evening. However, it caused fury among both Conservative politicians who have largely parked their longstanding criticism of the BBC during the pandemic, and also some journalists in and outside the public broadcaster who felt it went against the corporation’s approach to journalism.BBC news bosses agreed with the criticism of its own show, swiftly issuing a statement distancing themselves from the monologue. BBC sources said Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night’s episode.“The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,” the corporation said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.”Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said:\u0026nbsp“This statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses.\u0026nbspNewsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for\u0026nbsptheir serious investigative work on Cummings, that’s not something you could say about\u0026nbspthe BBC News at 10.\u0026nbsp“Pandering to\u0026nbsp10 Downing Street\u0026nbspby curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.”\u0026nbspAn SNP spokesperson added: “It’s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.”\u0026nbspMaitlis’s profile, already high, has risen further since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter.

She later responded to people sending messages of support: “Been overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages – and support on here – and I’ve probably missed much of it. A big thank you from us all at Newsnight.”Newsnight’s policy editor, Lewis Goodall, said he “couldn’t be prouder” to work on the programme alongside the “world-class” Maitlis.The row is another headache for the BBC, which has struggled to enforce its editorial standards codes in the social media era. Increasingly it has found itself forced to apologise by one side of the political debate for an on-air alleged error of judgment, only to be criticised again by the other side for apologising.Although the BBC has enjoyed a brief respite in recent months, Downing Street’s pushback against the media over the Cummings incident suggests normal service is being resumed.Talking of Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement over his loyalty to Cummings in the face of enormous public anger. “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it,” she said.The BBC said that while the programme “contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism”, it should have done more “to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3763fefbab75349720a6350987c28db3cfa18fa4/18_174_2747_1649/master/2747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2ffe43ef7db0eca2e25d281266d868","title":"virgin media to disappear from uk high street coronavirus","story":"Exclusive: firm’s 53 stores will not reopen after lockdown and staff will be offered other rolesVirgin Media is to disappear from the high street after deciding its network of more than 50 retail stores will stay shut once the coronavirus pandemic lockdown ends.The cable and TV company, which operates 53 stores in the UK, is offering the 341 affected staff the opportunity to move to newly created roles.About 300 of those posts will be in customer care, the majority of those based permanently at home, a decision Virgin Media has taken because of the success of its call centre staff moving to a working-from-home environment during the lockdown. Another 50 newly created roles relate mostly to field sales roles.“We are focused on delivering the service customers want, in the ways they want it and at a time and place that suits them,” said Rob Orr, an executive director for sales at Virgin Media. “By creating new jobs in our most popular care and sales channels, we will be better able to provide our customers with the top service and support they rightly expect while retaining our talented workforce.”The coronavirus pandemic has hastened a strategic shift the company was already making – moving away from the high street as more and more sales and customer inquiries were taking place online or over the phone. Virgin Media has whittled down the number of stores and kiosks it operates in the UK from 140 in 2016. In recent years, its rival Sky has also moved to dramatically reduce the number of physical stores it has across the UK.In March, Virgin Media moved to employ 500 new call centre staff in the UK over concerns that the outsourcing of customer calls to offshore workers in countries including India and the Philippines could be interrupted by the spread of the virus.Virgin Media has also moved to directly hire 700 engineers, most of whom were working for the cable company but employed by third-party businesses, to ensure it had the staff numbers to continue to carry out home visits, including installations and repairs.\u0026nbspThe company, which employs 12,000 people, is in the early stages of a merger with the mobile operator O2 to create a new TV, broadband and mobile powerhouse to challenge BT and Sky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

Travel Trolley has offered a credit note for the full amount and when I requested a refund it demanded a £75 admin fee to pass on the money already repaid by the airline! It can’t be legal to hold me to ransom like this.SB, LondonOther readers have written in with the same complaint. Travel Trolley, owned by multi-millionaire tycoon Kuljinder Bahia has insisted all passengers pay £75 if they want a cash refund rather than a credit note, despite the fact that its terms and conditions only mention the charge if a passenger, rather than the airline, cancels a flight. Skyscanner has publicly condemned the policy. “We’ve been supporting travellers who contact us and have been working closely with providers to try and ensure that any admin fees for refunds are reasonable,” it says. “We’ve seen success in some partners changing their policies as a result, and will continue discussions with providers to ensure travellers are being treated fairly. We’re asking Travel Trolley to treat cases from Skyscanner referrals as priority.”Travel Trolley failed to respond to requests for a comment. The trade association, ABTA, of which Travel Trolley is a member, says: “Travel agents may charge an admin fee to cover the cost of the work they have done in relation to a cancelled booking. However, these fees must be reasonable and clearly set out in their terms and conditions. If they have not reserved the right to do so, they should not charge a fee.”It referred the company to its legal team after the Observer alerted it. A notice has since appeared on Travel Trolley’s website announcing that it will cancel its fee and refund customers who have already paid it. “Whilst this is of significant financial loss to our business, our customers are of paramount importance to us,” it says. “As customers are facing huge financial difficulties, we hope that removing the fee will go in some way to ease their personal burdens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a8965695d924a224e918a2ddc98b713cffc8daf/0_140_2416_1449/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce4d69a4871b8a447fd00dc111e93540","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 7 the human league dont you want me","story":"Phil Oakey might have hated it, but his hook-laden hit about sexual power politics brought synth-pop in from the cold Sometimes you can’t quite trust artists to tell the truth about their best work. Speaking to Smash Hits around the time of Don’t You Want Me’s release and subsequent rise to the top of the charts in 1981, Human League singer Phil Oakey enthused: “It’s the best song I’ve ever written. It’s a proper song like the kind that Earth, Wind and Fire or Abba would write.” Producer Martin Rushent claimed that Oakey actually hated the eventual hit so much that he tried to stop it being released. Whatever the truth of the matter, Oakey’s public pronouncements were correct – this is aspirational music that chimed with the times yet had none of the ruthless, cynical avarice of the decade, and pop, to come.Don’t You Want Me was to crown the breakout year for electronic pop music – Soft Cell had hit the top of the charts in the same year as the Human League, but Tainted Love had the sneaky advantage of being a cover. Depeche Mode were bubbling up in Basildon, OMD had released the arch yet sumptuous Architecture and Morality, but with 2m record sales, the 1981 Christmas No 1 under its belt, and a US No 1 to boot, Don’t You Want Me is arguably the first synth-pop smash hit.Yet it was one that nearly never happened, even without Oakey’s alleged attempts to block it. After two moderately well received albums of hip, Kraftwerk-inspired post-punk austerity, founding Human Leaguers Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh had departed in 1980 to form Heaven 17. “Director of visuals” Philip Wright and singer Phil Oakey – a man with an asymmetric fringe so extravagant it looked as if it was making a bid for freedom under his elbow – were left with the name, and also the group’s debts to label Virgin.In need of a bigger lineup to fulfil tour commitments and pay off some of the money owed, Oakey brought in two teenagers he had seen dancing in Sheffield’s Crazy Daisy nightclub to take on the road as backing singers. The addition of best friends Joanne Catherall and Susan Anne Sulley might have looked like an act of desperation, but it ended up proving a masterstroke. It changed the dynamic of the band and Sulley’s vocals made Don’t You Want Me the hit it became. Pushed to the limits of their musical abilities, Wright and Oakey recruited an actual musician, keyboard player Ian Burden, and went into the studio with Rushent. Reflecting on the aims of the newly rehabilitated Human League, Oakey said: “We wanted an album full of singles, like a Michael Jackson or Abba LP … we’ve moved away from textures to tunes. It’s tunes every time.”He wasn’t wrong. Blessed not only with a solid gold chorus but also a synth bass riff and more hooks than the long line of a Cornish mackerel fisherman, Don’t You Want Me is one of those brilliant, breezy songs that carries a twisted subtext, taking subversion to the top of the charts. While most who heard the song might have perceived it as a lament between two lovers in a relationship that’s no longer firing, Oakey said that it’s instead “a nasty song about sexual power politics”. He plays the character of a svengali who appears to be warning the starlet he plucked from obscurity in the cocktail bar of the opening line that if she doesn’t continue their romantic relationship, her career is over, or maybe worse. In the age of #MeToo and the exposure of exploitative practices in the music industry, Don’t You Want Me is lyrically more relevant now than when it first caused a stir in 1981.Given the subject matter of the song, the presence of these two young women plucked from obscurity to find stardom was hardly going to go unnoticed, and the tabloids duly had a field day, speculating that the waitress from the cocktail bar was either or both of them. Catherall and Sulley constantly found themselves under misogyny-laden attack from press and industry alike. In a happier counterpoint to the complex sexual power play of the song’s lyrics, Oakey always stuck up for his colleagues and the decision to put them on a proper salary. In a 1986 NME interview, he blasted their detractors: “The musos have never liked them, they’ve never understood them. There’s no one sounds like Joanne and Susan. They make it a Human League record.”Don’t You Want Me stands as a shining example of what can happen when a bunch of relative amateurs with a point to prove and a keen aesthetic eye get down to work. And after all, part of the charm of the Human League and the moment they encapsulated, the experimentalism of post-punk meeting the new possibilities of electronic music technology, is that it was so refreshingly carefree, the sound of synth pop coming in from the cold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb6918fad719d74c29cfce407b182bf7162582c/0_136_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1f6798d055eb8cf8d516227fdd916d","title":"cummings and not goings","story":"The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the storyDominic Cummings has given his version of the events that have dominated the news for the past five days.

The role pays £40,000 a year for an average of two days a week.McLoughlin was an MP for 33 years, firstly for West Derbyshire and then the newly created constituency of Derbyshire Dales. A former miner, he held a series of ministerial posts.While one of these roles was transport secretary, McLoughlin does not appear to have direct experience of the tourism industry. That contrasts with his immediate predecessor, Steve Ridgway, a former chief executive of Virgin Atlantic who also ran his own travel company, owned a hotel and chaired a ferry company.De Bois held the Enfield North seat from 2010 to 2015, and was later chief of staff for Dominic Raab, when he was Brexit secretary. Aside from politics, his background is in the events and exhibitions sector.He has been made chair of the VisitEngland advisory board, another part-time role, which will pay up to £16,320 a year for a maximum of four days work a month on a three-year contract.De Bois also replaces a person with extensive tourism experience. Denis Wormwell had spent 30 years in the travel, hospitality and transport sectors, including co-owning Club 18-30, setting up an airline, and running the now-defunct holiday group Shearings. Ridgway and Wormwell were both appointed in 2017 for three-year terms.Labour said the selection of McLoughlin and De Bois appeared to show clear favouritism. The MP Ben Bradshaw, a former culture secretary, said: “By handing out plush appointments like these to former Tory MPs with little relevant experience, the government are furthering the impression they believe it’s one rule for them and their chums, another for the British public.”The appointments come at a critical time for the UK tourism and heritage sector, which have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic and will suffer even more from a planned mandatory 14-day quarantine period for people arriving in the UK.Speaking to the Commons culture, media and sport committee last week, Patricia Yates, the acting chief executive of VisitBritain, said the tourism sector expected to lose £37bn from the impact of Covid-19.VisitBritain has predicted there will be a £15bn drop in income from overseas visitors.A government spokeswoman said: “Both roles were filled through fair and open competitions, regulated by the commissioner for public appointments, in accordance with the governance code for public appointments.“Candidates were assessed by an independent advisory panel who found that both Patrick McLoughlin and Nick de Bois had the relevant experience and skills to meet the requirements of their roles.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9acab2879613aadc4a8f77dca9311635fb9ff1b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a99e5182d441864bbac5ba667071363d","title":"questions raised over hydroxychloroquine study which caused who to halt trials for covid 19","story":"Exclusive: Australian researchers query origin of data used for Lancet study, but stress there is no evidence drug is a safe or effective treatment• Sign up for  Australia’s daily coronavirus email• Download the free  app to get the most important news notifications Questions have been raised by Australian infectious disease researchers about a study published in the Lancet which prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19.The study published on Friday found Covid-19 patients who received the malaria drug were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients. The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug.The study, led by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Center for Advanced Heart Disease in Boston, examined patients in hospitals around the world, including in Australia. It said researchers gained access to data from five hospitals recording 600 Australian Covid-19 patients and 73 Australian deaths as of 21 April.But data from Johns Hopkins University shows only 67 deaths from Covid-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April. The data relied upon by researchers to draw their conclusions in the Lancet is not readily available in Australian clinical databases, leading many to ask where it came from.The federal health department confirmed to  Australia that the data collected on notifications of Covid-19 in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System was not the source for informing the trial. Australia also contacted the health departments of Australia’s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, which have had by far the largest number of Covid-19 infections between them. Of the Australian deaths reported by 21 April, 14 were in Victoria and 26 in NSW.Victoria’s department confirmed the study’s results relating to the Australian data did not reconcile with the state’s coronavirus data, including hospital admissions and deaths. The NSW Department of Health also confirmed it did not provide the researchers with the data for its databases.The Lancet told  Australia: “We have asked the authors for clarifications, we know that they are investigating urgently, and we await their reply.”\u0026nbspThe lead author of the study, \u0026nbspDr Mandeep Mehra, said he had contacted Surgisphere, the company that provided the data, to reconcile the discrepancies with “the utmost urgency”.\u0026nbspSurgisphere is described as a healthcare data analytics and medical education company.In a statement, Surgisphere founder Dr Sapan Desai, also an author on the Lancet paper, said a hospital from Asia had accidentally been included in the Australian data.He said the error did not change the overall study findings. It did mean that the Australian data in the paper would be revised to four hospitals and 63 deaths,.Dr Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor with Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the Australian hospitals involved in the study should be named. He said he had never heard of Surgisphere, and no one from his hospital, The Alfred, had provided Surgisphere with data.“Usually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database,” he said. He said the dataset should be made public, or at least open to an independent statistical reviewer.“If they got this wrong, what else could be wrong?” Cheng said. It was also a “red flag” to him that the paper listed only four authors.“Usually with studies that report on findings from thousands of patients, you would see a large list of authors on the paper,” he said. “Multiple sources are needed to collect and analyse the data for large studies and you usually see that acknowledged in the list of authors.”He stressed that even if the paper proved to be problematic, it did not mean hydroxychloroquine was safe or effective in treating Covid-19. No strong studies to date have shown the drug is effective. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have potentially severe and even deadly side effects if used inappropriately, including heart failure and toxicity. Other studies have found the drug is associated with higher mortality when given to severely unwell Covid-19 patients.In a statement Surgisphere said it stood by the integrity of its data, saying all information from\u0026nbsphospitals “is transferred in a deidentified manner” but could not be made public.\u0026nbsp“This requirement allows us to only maintain collaborations with top-tier institutions that are supported by the level of data-integrity and sophistication required for such work,” the statement said. “Naturally, this leads to the inclusion of institutions that have a tertiary care level of practice and provide quality healthcare that is relatively homogenous around the world. As with most corporations, the access to inidual hospital data is strictly governed. Our data use agreements do not allow us to make this data public.”Scientists have reiterated the need to wait for the results from rigorous randomised control trials, considered the gold standard of science, and the Australian Department of Health has warned the drug should not be given to patients other than in clinical trials.Cheng said it would be a mistake to stop strong, well-designed clinical trials examining the drug because of questionable data. The Lancet study findings have prompted the leaders of an Australian hydroxychloroquine trial, known as the Ascot trial, to review the future of their study. The outcome of that review has not yet been announced.The Ascot study has been recruiting patients in more than 70 hospitals in every Australian state and territory, and 11 hospitals in New Zealand. The randomised control trial is exploring whether hydroxychloroquine in combination or on its own can treat Covid-19 patients and prevent deterioration in their condition. The leader of the trial, Prof Josh Davis, has written to the Lancet study authors asking for an explanation of the data.In the meantime, patient recruitment for the study had been put on hold, an Ascot spokeswoman said. “Following an\u0026nbspobservational study published in\u0026nbspthe Lancet\u0026nbspAscot has paused patient recruitment pending deliberations by the governance and ethics committees overseeing the trial,” she said. “We expect these deliberations to occur rapidly and will provide further information as they arise.”Questions about the paper’s statistical modelling have also come from other universities, including Columbia University in the US, prompting Surgisphere to issue a public statement.Last month Australia’s chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, urged the public to be cautious about findings and interpretations from studies in the race to find cures and treatments for Covid-19.Serious concerns have being raised by bioethicists, clinicians and scientists that scientific rigour and peer review is falling by the wayside in the race to understand how the virus spreads and why it has such a devastating impact on some people.Do you know more? melissa.davey@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

It came out in April 2019 to replace the popular Forerunner 235.The Forerunner 245 resembles a round digital watch and is just 42.3mm wide, 12.2mm thick and 38.5g in weight, which by sports watch standards is tiny, comparing favourably with the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 and the Apple Watch Series 5. It takes standard universal 20mm watch bands and comes with an excellent traditional silicone strap that fits wrists between 127mm and 204mm in circumference: in other words most wrists.The colour transflective LCD display – which is not a touchscreen – can be seen in direct sunlight without the need for a backlight, although there is one for the night. The display is clear and easily readable at a glance, but is pretty basic compared with the flashy OLED screens on smartwatches. Think of it more like an advanced colour digital watch and you will get the idea.There are quite a few watch faces to choose from, including digital and analogue options, plus many more available from third parties via Garmin’s Connect IQ store.The up, down and back buttons take you around the interface. The startstop button doubles as a select button and the light button powers the watch on and accesses quick settings. Press and hold the down button to access music controls or the up button to quickly jump to the full settings menus.From the watch face you can also access a long list of customisable widgets using the up and down buttons, including smartphone notifications, calendar, the weather, health stats, stress levels, your heart rate, previous runs and many others.The Forerunner 245 fully charges in two hours via a short snap-in USB cable that plugs into the back of the watch and can connect to Garmin’s desktop Express software on Windows or Mac.The watch connects to your Android or iPhone via Bluetooth and the Garmin Connect app, which handles syncing data, updates, smart notifications and other bits. The separate Garmin Connect IQ app handles installing apps, including watch faces, widgets and music services.The Forerunner 245 Music also has wifi for syncing your activities straight to the cloud, downloading music and software updates.The Garmin Connect app is extremely comprehensive, able to display an almost bewildering amount of information, with analysis often reserved for pay-for subscriptions elsewhere, such as how effective your training is. Recent updates have made the app a lot more beginner-friendly, particularly for day-to-day health tracking.The Forerunner 245 is generally repairable, but Garmin typically replaces damaged devices with refurbished units for a fee. The battery is not user replaceable, but straps are. The screen is covered in Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3, similar to a smartphone.The Forerunner 245 tracks lots of sports but excels for running with practically every feature you can think of, whether that’s on a treadmill, track, trail or road. The battery lasts up to 24 hours tracking with GPS, and just under six hours playing music.The GPS trails are the most accurate I’ve tested in suburban London, matching distance and routes with very little deviation from maps and race lengths. The time it takes to get a GPS lock, and the strength of that lock, has been drastically improved with a recent software update too, getting a lock within 20 seconds of stepping outdoors most of the time.Garmin’s third-generation heart rate sensor is about as accurate as optical scanners can be too, and for the majority of people will be more than accurate enough for training purposes. If you need better you can connect a chest strap via Bluetooth.During a run you have a series of customisable screens with a varying number of fields and stats on display. The screens are well designed and easy to understand with just a quick glance mid-run.You can get the watch to beep and vibrate when you’ve hit certain milestones, such as laps or distance, and speak things like your average pace every three minutes through Bluetooth headphones. You can also set a target based on distance, time or pace, which is extremely handy for running a 5K without a running track.Alongside VO2 Max estimates, used as an overall measure of fitness, the Garmin can measure performance and tell you if you have worked hard enough. Between six and 20 minutes into your run the watch will beep and give you a positive or negative score, which is either a kick to run harder or confirmation that you’re on track. I find it extremely useful.The Forerunner 245 can track workouts such as interval training too. The watch has a built-in coach with adaptive plans for beginners to intermediates with a 5K time over 21 minutes.But you can easily programme your own or download sessions, based on pace, distance, heart rate zone or other metrics. Running at a pace, for instance, the watch beeps a countdown to the start of the interval.During the sprint the watch beeps when you are over or under your target pace alongside a glanceable dial on screen. It works really well and means you do not need a track, a set place to run or someone with a timer to do effective interval training.The only thing missing is a barometer. You’ll still get elevation data from maps, but if you look to train using elevation this might be a deal-breaker.The Forerunner 245 does a good job of tracking most of the basic cycling stats similar to running (pace, distance, heart rate etc) and can be paired with various external sensors for speed and cadence, plus Garmin’s smart lights.Swimming, including heart rate, lengths, distance, stroke type and count, calories and other bits can be tracked in the pool too. Plus gym workouts and a handful of other activities profiles, such as walking, yoga, rowing and weights.Overall health tracking is also extensive, covering all the usual suspects such as steps, calories, distance, intensity, heart rate, move notifications, menstrual tracking and stress.Garmin’s body battery attempts to track your energy levels during the day to show when best to exercise or rest. The watch tracks sleep, including cycles, heart rate and estimates blood oxygen saturation, and it can alert you when if heart rate spikes when not active. The only thing missing compared to the very best fitness trackers on the market is ECG measurements for your heart.Both versions of the Forerunner 245 can control music playback on a smartphone, but only the Forerunner 245 Music can download tracks and play them without a phone, with a capacity for 3.5GB or 500 tracks.Music in MP3 or AAC format can be transferred via USB cable from the computer using Garmin Express. If you’re a Spotify Premium, Deezer or Amazon Music user, you can install the associated app on your watch and sync music and podcasts directly to the watch via wifi. The Spotify app works really well, although downloading large playlists takes quite some time. Playing Spotify on runs without a phone is a killer feature but reduces the battery life to six hours.Alongside health tracking, the Forerunner 245 has basic smartwatch features, vibrating when you get a text, notification or call on your phone. You can scroll through the text of a notification and clear it, reject a call and that sort of thing.The battery lasts about a week with the screen on, notifications and health-tracking active, including heart rate, which is significantly longer than most smartwatches that only manage up to two days.The smartwatch functions work with both Android and an iPhone. They will not match a true smartwatch, but if you are looking for alerts on your wrist the Garmin does the job.The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a runner’s best friend, and sets a new bar by which most other running watches will be measured.The watch is small, slim and light. The display is very clear and easy to read. It has practically every stat and aid necessary to track, measure and help with running and training, and comprehensive analysis and export of data to many popular services, including Strava.Much of the information will be overkill for casual runners, but for those looking for a tool that works reliably with real buttons and helps them analyse their runs, do intervals and train better, the Garmin ticks practically every box. Seven days’ battery as a watch or 24 hours’ tracking runs doesn’t hurt either. Buy the one with music and free yourself from your phone for motivational tunes or podcasts, including offline Spotify support.It also does a great job of tracking a lot of other activities and features comprehensive general health monitoring too, including sleep, stress and heart rate alerts. Its smartwatch-like features get the basics right without trying to do too much, plus it has a fair few watch faces available and easy-to-swap standard straps.It’s not the cheapest, but the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a truly great running and fitness watch that is easy to live with on a daily basis.Cons: expensive, no barometer, no touchscreen as well as buttons, interface can be a bit clunky, screen fairly basic compared with smartwatches This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

We know our work supports a nationFor more than two decades, Roberto Valdez has harvested crops in California’s eastern Coachella Valley, a scorching region dotted with impoverished communities that are surrounded by bountiful fields of grapes, bell peppers, broccoli, watermelon, and more. In 2005, after his son nearly died from heat stroke while picking grapes, Valdez advocated for improved safety measures for farmworkers, which culminated in new state regulations that protect workers from heat stress. An undocumented immigrant, he is not eligible for federal relief during the Covid-19 pandemic, but while millions of people shelter in place, he continues to work in the fields with his wife. Here he tells Gabriel Thompson about his life as an essential worker.Right now I’m harvesting eggplant for $13 an hour. The company gives the crew a 50 cent bonus for each box we fill, so in eight hours we can earn an extra $15 or so. The plants are about 4ft tall and the eggplants grow low, so we usually work on our knees in the dirt. You cut off the eggplants with scissors and fill up buckets that weigh between 40 and 50 pounds, carry them to a large tub where they are washed and packed, and dump them in.It tires you out, especially when it’s hot. It was 105 degrees today. By 10 in the morning your clothes are completely soaked with sweat and it’s hard to make it through the eight hours. In fact, some days there are people who leave, who can’t make it.Because of the coronavirus we always cover our faces now, no matter what the temperature is. The company has given us disposable blue masks, but we mostly use bandanas. The masks don’t stay clean for very long and they start to smell. When they’re dirty, it’s very hard to breathe. The sun is hot, the ground is hot, you’re working fast, and you can’t breathe. A bandana you can wash and use again. I bring three bandanas every day: one that goes over my head to protect my neck, and two that I use as masks. We have breaks every four hours, and I use that time to wash the old one out with water and soap and put on a new one. My wife and I work together on the crew, and I bought sixteen bandanas that we use.We leave two rows between each person now, a distance of about 8ft. Before, we ate lunch together around portable tables in the shade. We’d share food. “Hey, grab a taco!” That’s all over. Now we eat apart, mostly in our cars. I also can’t greet people like I used to do, either. I’m the kind of person who likes to shake hands, pat people on the back. “How’s it going? How’re you doing this morning?” Among us Latinos, that’s very common. That’s over, too.But we still joke and talk, even though we’re separated. There are about 30 people in the crew, and some of us have worked together for years. There are people who are tired, and we’ll tell them a story, just so they’ll be able to get through the day – that’s how we make the work more bearable. Some people have had to stop working because of the coronavirus. There’s a young woman, a single mother with two kids, and she couldn’t keep working because the schools and daycares have shut down. It’s very hard right now – so many mothers have had to stay home.You have to respect this disease. My brother-in-law died eight days ago, in Mexicali. He was in his 40s and worked at a plant that makes glass. He had high blood pressure and kidney problems, and they had to operate on his kidneys in March. While he was in the hospital he had a hard time breathing, and they suspected he had the coronavirus. They isolated him and put him in an area where the Covid-19 patients were. They didn’t give my sister any information about how he was doing. The government said he died of the coronavirus, but we’re still waiting for the official cause of death. It hurt us a lot, because he was a very good person and no one could visit him.I saw a news report from New York, where doctors were saying that people weren’t keeping quarantine – going out even when they were supposed to be at home, and more people got infected. That’s something we think a lot about. We stay very clean at work, because we know innocent people are buying the food we harvest, with money they have earned, so that their families will be healthy. And the majority of farmworkers, we’re happy to work, we do so with love, and the coronavirus won’t stop us. It’s not going to stop us. Because we know that our work supports the whole nation.Right now, Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed giving undocumented immigrants $500 each. There are people who have sued to try and stop this, a woman named Jessica Martinez and a man from El Salvador, Ricardo Benitez. I’d like these people to come out and meet us. I’d like them to see us working. There are people out here who really need this $500, especially people who have lost their jobs. We are the people who are feeding the country. No one else is going to be able to do this. We are the only ones who know how.We are people who’ve lived in the country 10 and 20 years, and we don’t have a social security number. From my point of view – I say this from my heart – we are like chess pieces that politicians move around. They haven’t done anything, since Barack Obama, since Bill Clinton, since 911. I remember I was picking grapes in Arvin when they attacked the twin towers. Back then there was talk of immigration reform for workers. We’ve had hope for a long time, and nothing has happened. We pay taxes. We go to stores and we buy things. Our kids are studying in school. My daughter is about to graduate high school. It’s hard for me to understand why they aren’t letting us become legal residents.In the media, they’re now calling us “essential workers”. But that’s what we’ve always been. We think of doctors, firefighters, and police as important. People who never saw us before now see that we also have value. The coronavirus has brought us both good and bad opportunities. It has hurt us, and it has also made many people realize something they didn’t realize before: that they need us.Last Monday I arrived home from work and there was a box at my door. The box was filled with milk, bags of lettuce, cabbage, onions, and potatoes. I don’t know who brought us the food. I asked the person who manages the trailer park, and he just said some people came to drop off food for everyone. It made me want to cry. It meant that someone was thinking about us, that someone was worrying about us. This was a gesture of kindness toward us. Nothing like that had happened before.Roberto’s name has been changed to protect his identity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c04ba12e9eb982bcfd25b22727fa425c3212747/0_142_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06fedc59e0896a5e77f118ddf8019f4f","title":"new york summer coronavirus covid in pictures","story":"Photographer Jordan Gale was curious to see how New Yorkers would adapt to a post Covid-19 summer.

She sees things from the “customer experience” and is passionate about getting it right, one source said.She is one of the most high-profile women involved in the coronavirus response, and it is likely the health secretary, Matt Hancock, will look to her to provide the details and direction of the scheme, which has endured a bumpy journey so far.Hancock faced weeks of criticism for the government’s decision to abandon initial contact tracing efforts on 12 March.Harding confidently presented the rules and “new principles”, as Hancock described it, in her first appearance at the Downing Street press conference, drawing a line under past efforts.Such was her confidence in the new strategy – which involves 25,000 contact tracers – she said: “If anything I’m worried that many of my brilliant contact tracers are not going to be very busy as we start to encourage more people to get a test.” She said there were “easily enough to trace down the contacts today when the vast majority of us are in lockdown”. The Isle of Wight contact, track and trace app trial provides a major challenge. Beset by delays, a version of the app has yet to be rolled out nationwide.Harding was made a peer in 2014 by David Cameron. Just a year later she was at the eye of the storm in the TalkTalk hacking scandal in which the details of 156,959 customers – including names, emails and phone numbers – and 15,000 bank account numbers were accessed by hackers with the company receiving a record £400,000 fine from the information commissioner.About 18 months later she resigned saying she wanted to focus on “more activities in public service”.She is married to John Penrose, a Tory MP and former minister, and has previously worked in management for Sainsbury’s and Tesco. She is a non-executive director on the Court of the Bank of England and chair of the bank’s remuneration committee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a11d36f02af2f66a5f1eb9f5bce99320e72f80/0_105_2300_1381/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc98918ab2a4b498ea6c1d93fa9210ad","title":"venezuela us funded rock bands hugo chavez","story":"Partially redacted grant application shows scheme involved paying 10 groups to write songs promoting ‘freedom of expression’The United States funded rock groups in Venezuela to record songs promoting democracy – and undermine the rule of Hugo Chávez – according to documents released after a Freedom of Information Act request.More than 10 bands were contracted in 2011 to produce new songs promoting freedom of expression in the oil-rich nation. The $22,970 scheme, which was to culminate in a battle-of-the-bands style concert, was approved by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a non-governmental agency responsible for promoting democracy abroad.The partially redacted grant application was uncovered by Tim Gill, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and shows the efforts of US officials “to promote greater reflection among Venezuelan youth about freedom of expression, their connection with democracy, and the state of democracy in the country”.Gill said the revelations were unorthodox but unsurprising. “The NED supported many causes in order to promote democracy, not all of them nefarious,” the academic said. “But the issue is that it has the ability to fund some voices instead of others.”Successive US governments sought to unseat Chávez, whose self-styled Bolivarian revolution was in part built on anti-American sentiment. The populist leader was briefly unseated in 2002 by a military coup. It later emerged that the administration of George W Bush had known about the coup beforehand, although Washington distanced itself publicly from involvement.\u0026nbspBy 2011, US officials were apparently exploring less dramatic measures to undermine his leadership.“I can’t imagine they thought this alone was going to bring down the government,” Gill said. “But is music important and does it shape people’s views? I could draw a straight line from listening to punk rock to reading Noam Chomsky and learning about stuff about revolutions and interventions that they don’t teach in schools.”It is not the only time the US has attempted to spark unrest through music in adversarial Latin American countries.

All they’ve been told is to have a plan in place by the end of June,” he said.Contact tracers working in the national network were unable to log in to the newly launched track-and-trace systems on Thursday after a critical IT incident.An email seen by the  was sent to clinical staff by the contact centre company Sitel that read: “We are aware of a CTAS login issue for NHS professionals this has been reported as a critical incident.”One worker said: “Yesterday I got two emails with links to log on to the contact-tracing system.

The true death toll and number of cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Grigoryan said he was not aligned with a specific political party and denied that Medmedia or the fact-finding project were political fronts aimed at opposing the government.“If we look at everything from a political point of view then we’re not going to go very far,” he said. “But from an expert point of view, the statistics speak for themselves.”Armenia has reported about 7,100 coronavirus cases and a rising rate of infections. The country has also grappled with a drop in childhood vaccine rates, which the health minister, Arsen Torosyan, has blamed on anti-vaccine propaganda.The State Department declined to comment on questions about the size of the grant or its review process.A post on the US embassy’s website in Armenia said grants under the Democracy Commission Small Grants Program – which are worth up to $50,000 – are awarded on a competitive basis to local NGOs and are meant to focus on issues like transparency and accountability in governance, advancing human rights, eliminating corruption, and enhancing economic growth and development.But the openDemocracy investigation found that, while Medmedia had published some news articles, most of its opinion pieces were republished Facebook posts that spread false information.Grigoryan told the  that the US embassy in Armenia had contacted him with “concerns” about op-eds and articles on the site. But, he said: “I am sure I was able to answer all those questions and those concerns disappeared. The site is not an anti-vaccine forum.”He would not say how much money was given to his Armenian Association for Young Doctors by the US embassy, or how much of that was invested in the website. He called it a “small amount” and addressed questions on specifics to the US embassy. The grant period is due to end in several days, he said.A disclaimer on the Medmedia website said the site was US-funded but that its articles “do not necessarily reflect” the views of the US government.Asked specifically about the articles, he said that he didn’t share their opinions but said they would not be taken down. “It’s not fake news,” he said. “It’s the opinion of a specialist, the opinion of a doctor, of the head of an NGO. It’s an opinion. So it’s not fake news.”He denied that posting the articles could pose a public health risk, saying they would “initiate discussion.”While he denied being personally opposed to vaccines, he claimed the articles on his site were representative of skepticism about vaccines in Armenian society.Grigoryan said his past anti-LGBT statements, including one that said he would “always fight against gays,” had been misinterpreted and were prompted by specific cases of “anti-social behaviour.” He did not respond to follow-up questions about a Facebook post from 2014 where he wrote that “gays should be burnt and in a public\u0026nbspplace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/634586abbd566947b16a8c14adbab7ed6e5a9032/749_557_4036_2422/master/4036.jpg?width=4000\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd69fd80728ac17675dc7817c648c96 8000w","title":"uk coronavirus live test and trace gets under way in england and scotland","story":"Durham police say there will be no further action against No 10 adviser over breach of lockdown rulesHere is the full statement issued by Durham police to say Dominic Cummings will not face further action.On March 27 2020, Dominic Cummings drove to Durham to self-isolate in a property owned by his father.Durham Constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father’s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation six of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. (We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general Government guidance to “stay at home”.)On April 12 2020, Mr Cummings drove approximately 26 miles from his father’s property to Barnard Castle with his wife and son. He stated on May 25 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR, witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings’ press conference on May 25 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis.Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.In line with Durham Constabulary’s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on April 19 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision. The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed.Announcing that she would proceed with Phase One on the Scottish government’s four stage plan for moving out of lockdown, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said at her daily briefing that figures showed a “sustained and unmistakable” downward trend in cases.She added, however, that the changes must be “careful and cautious” and that the R number remains in range of 0.7 to 1. There were 12 deaths from coronavirus in Scotland overnight, taking the total number of deaths under that measure to 2,316.The relaxation comes as the Scottish government’s own Test and Protect scheme goes live on Thursday across all health board areas.From Friday, Scots will now be able to meet with members of one other household at a time. This must happen outdoors, in a park or private gardens, and while observing social distancing, and the total number of people meeting up should be a maximum of 8. There is also a strong recommendation not to meet more than one other household per day. People will be allowed to travel – preferably by walking or cycling - for recreation or visits, with a suggested limit of five miles, although Sturgeon has said that people should “use their judgement”. Sitting or sunbathing in parks will be permitted, as will many outdoor non-contact sports including golf, fishing, tennis and bowls.In terms of business, most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume. Garden centres and recycling facilities are also allowed to reopen, while takeaway and drive-through food outlets will no longer be discouraged. From Monday, teachers can return to schools to prepare for the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils begin a ‘blended’ model of at home and in school learning. And from Wednesday, child minding services and fully outdoor nurseries will begin to re-open. The prime minister’s most senior adviser did breach lockdown rules when he made the 50-mile trip to Barnard Castle, an investigation by Durham police has reportedly found.Dominic Cummings claimed he made the journey on 12 April – Easter Sunday and his wife’s birthday – with his wife and four-year-old son to check his eyesight was sound before travelling back to London.He has maintained that he acted “lawfully and reasonably” when he journeyed 264 miles north to self-isolate on his parent’s farm in County Durham at the end of March, at the height of the pandemic.The  (paywall) reports that the Durham Police investigation has concluded that this was a minor breach of the guidelines that did not warrant any further action.More on this story to follow.This is from the ’s Martin EvansThe Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has written to MPs regarding the early recall of parliament next week at 11:30am on Tuesday to approve a new voting system.In the letter he says the main purpose of the recall is to bring forward a motion on how the House should vote, considering the usual way of voting using ision lobbies doesn’t marry up with social distancing and wouldn’t be safe, and there is currently no other method for isions sanctioned by the House.The government has until Monday morning to table its motion on how it proposes voting take place.The attorney general, Suella Braverman, has dismissed accusations that she has undermined the independence of her office by tweeting her support for Dominic Cummings’ trip to Durham during lockdown.Last Saturday, in the wake of the ’s story about Cummings, the MP for Fareham tweeted: “Protecting one’s family is what any good parent does”. It was attached to the No 10 statement defending Cummings’ travels.Her involvement provoked calls for her to resign on the grounds that the intervention compromised the independence of her office as the government’s chief legal adviser and put her in an impossible position in relation to any subsequent police inquiry. Lord Falconer, Labour’s shadow attorney general, wrote to her stating: The prime minister should not be lending his authority to attacks on the enforcement of the criminal law. He should certainly not be egged on in that by the attorney general. On Thursday, Falconer published her response on Twitter:Since you wrote Mr Cummings has given a full account of his decisions to address the questions you and others have raised.There is of course no question of my having offered any public legal view (as you know, Law Officers do not publish their legal advice much less tweet about it) nor of seeking to pre-empt any formal investigation. The purpose of my comments, as I think would be obvious to any fair minded observer, was simply to support the decision to clarify events...Nearly half of over-70s could be self-isolating unnecessarily, after new research found widespread misinterpretation of government rules among older people. In fact, UK government guidance for this group – classed as clinically vulnerable – is to stay at home as much as possible and “take particular care” in physical distancing. Only those with certain conditions, classed as extremely clinically vulnerable – such as those with specific cancers – have been advised to stay at home at all times.Less than a third of the 483 older people polled correctly identified the correct guidance for over-70s without underlying health conditions.The results suggest thousands of people in later life around the UK may have completely shielded themselves and lived in isolation, when they could have left the house for physically distanced exercise and shopping for essentials.Durham police today said they fined two people for travelling hundreds of miles from London to their area during the coronavirus lockdown.The news comes as a fresh statement from Durham police is expected as soon as today, following their examination of claims of sightings of Dominic Cummings in the Durham area, and whether lockdown rules had been broken.A spokesperson for Durham police confirmed the fines were issued on 8 April against two people from different households who travelled together from London to Peterlee, in County Durham. That trip is about 260 miles and came just over a week after the prime minister’s key aide decided to drive with his wife and child from his London home to his parents’ farm, fearing being struck down by coronavirus.The trip by Cummings has led to no action by police, and its revelation on Friday by the  and Daily Mirror led to calls for Cummings’ resignation, but he has maintained his actions were lawful and not in breach of the lockdown.Cummings also admitted to a trip on 12 April to a beauty spot, Barnard Castle, with his wife and child. He said on Monday he had been testing his eyesight and fitness to drive after being struck down by the virus.Durham police say since the original news stories, they have received further claims and complaints from the public and are examining that information. Cummings said he travelled to ensure childcare in case he and his wife were struck down by the virus, and claims an exemption to the stay at home order issued by his boss, the prime minister, allowed him to make the trip. Many disagree and have called for his resignation. The new statement from Durham police is eagerly awaited.The Tory MP Karen Bradley has said she is “not convinced” by Dominic Cummings’ explanation of his actions and that aspects of his account suggest “there were breaches of the rules to avoid some of the hardships that many have endured”.In a statement on her website, the Staffordshire Moorlands MP wrote that the PM’s most senior adviser should “consider his position”. It reads: I can well understand that any parent wants to protect their child, and have enormous sympathy with acting to do that. But so much of the account goes beyond that simple human instinct and suggests that there were breaches of the rules to avoid some of the hardships that many have endured.I want you to know that I have shared your views at the highest level. Mr Cummings is, in my view causing significant damage to the work that the government are doing to get us through the pandemic. I hope that he will recognise this and consider his position. We expect those that lead us to lead by example, especially those with such a significant influence on government. I can reach no other conclusion than that for the sake of this country, Mr Cummings should do the right thing now and stop damaging the work that needs to be done.If the UK government wants to start easing the national lockdown, it needs to get contact tracing right – that much is clear. But what does that mean? What would successful contact tracing look like?In this explainer, Josh Toussaint-Strauss tries to find out with help from Christophe Fraser, an Oxford professor and infectious disease epidemiologist, and the ’s UK technology editor, Alex Hern.More than 50 of the UK’s leading artistic directors and theatre figures from ethnically erse backgrounds, including the Young Vic’s Kwame Kwei-Amah, have signed an open letter that calls on the culture secretary Oliver Dowden to ensure that “ethnic ersity is protected and celebrated in policy” as Covid-19 threatens to dramatically reshape the UK’s cultural landscape.The signatories point to the recent success of John Boyega, Idris Elba and Gemma Chan, who began their careers on British stages before finding success, and warns that without policies to protect ersity it could be lost as theatres struggle to operate in a post Covid-19 UK.The letter calls on Dowden and the government to “ensure the progress we have collectively made does not fall by the way-side” because of the impact of the pandemic, which has already caused the closure of several theatres around the country.The Covid-19 crisis threatens all aspects of the theatrical ecology, but catalysed by the revelations of the racial disparity in the health crisis, this group of Black, Asian and ethnically erse artistic leaders call on the government and the sector to ensure the progress we have collectively made does not fall by the way-side.We insist that ethnic ersity is protected and celebrated in policy going forwards and propose that any task-force or group gathering to speak about the future of our industry seeks out consultation from Black, Asian and ethnically erse leaders to ensure this commitment.Signatories of the letter include Lynette Linton, the artistic director of Bush Theatre and Roy Alexander Weise, the co-artistic director of the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, who say the erse theatremakers they represent are “essential to the arts returning at full strength and playing its part in our nation’s recovery”.Reopening primary schools to some year groups next week could have a “detrimental impact” on home learning for pupils who are still at home, the leader of the headteachers’ union has warned.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said fewer teachers would be available to support children with remote learning if pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 are taught in smaller groups from next week.His comments came ahead of the government’s final decision on whether to reopen primary schools in England to more pupils from as early as Monday.On Wednesday, the school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said it was “difficult to say” whether the government’s aim to get all primary school pupils back in class before the summer break will occur.He told MPs on the education select committee: Remote education, home education, will continue for the majority of pupils and young people – probably until the end of the summer term.The survey of 4,784 school leaders, carried out earlier this month, also found that the majority of schools have been creating their own online resources as well as liaising with parents about home learning.But the NAHT is concerned that the quality of remote learning on offer for the year groups that will not be returning to school in the summer term may suffer amid a wider reopening of schools in England.Whiteman told the PA news agency: Splitting classes in order to reduce the risk of transmission requires twice the number of staff, leaving fewer teachers to support those other children still at home.I worry that an unintended consequence will be a detrimental impact on home learning. I know the profession will continue to do all that it can, there are no easy answers."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Unthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debateRite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong time"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A debate has been happening in recent days on whether the recommended two metres of physical distancing with others to avoid the spread of the coronavirus can be reduced safely to one metre.So what is the current guidance in Ireland?The public health advice the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is that people should maintain a distance of two metres to avoid the spread of Covid-19. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at the weekend “there is no change” to the two-metre rule.Why is this?HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said on Sunday the two-metre distance was based on the projected distance that a droplet containing the virus can spread to another person through cough and sneezing. The decision to maintain a two-metre distance was the reason, he said, why the reproduction rate in the speed of the virus had fallen to the point where it is now suppressed. So who wants it reduced to one metre?Some Government ministers and other politicians. There was a debate at Cabinet last Friday evening about whether the recommended distance should be reduced to one metre as it would make it easier for people in education, healthcare and other areas of work and could help businesses such as restaurants reopen more quickly.Would it help the health service?Yes, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said that it would help the health service treat more patients and create “significantly extra capacity” across the HSE in emergency departments, waiting rooms and other areas if the recommended distance was one metre. What’s the international advice?The World Health Organisation considers a one-metre distance between people to be safe. So what level of protection does this provide?WHO’s special envoy on Covid-19 David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, said that two metres “keeps you safe 99 per cent of the time but you can greatly reduce risk even at one metre because 70 per cent of the droplets will stick within one metre.”What other international advice is there?The European Centre for Disease Control still advises people to maintain a distance of two metres, while in the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to stay “at least six feet” - about two metres - apart.Has there been similar differing views among public health specialists in Ireland?Yes, NPHET’s expert advisory group said in March that there was a “lack of evidence in distinguishing between one and two metres.” Dr Cillian de Gascun, chairman of the group and director of the UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that in some circumstances such as in healthcare and domestic settings where it is not possible or practical to maintain two metres distance “the recommendation is that at least one metre but ideally two metres are maintained between people, especially in the context of keeping distance from symptomatic iniduals.”Are there other views out there in Ireland?Yes, the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre advised healthcare workers in March to maintain a physical distance of at least one metre but ideally two from iniduals with respiratory symptoms in suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases. In another guidance note advising how to minimise the risk of transmission in pharmacies on March 16th, the HPSC said that “if a healthcare worker can maintain a distance of one metre from the patient’s mouth and nose, they are not within the likely range of droplet transmission. This helps protect both.”Are there risks by moving back to one metre?Yes.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Flights out of the country remain grounded.Hundreds of foreign residents remain in Pyongyang, including diplomats from the Swedish and Russian embassies and a small number of aid workers, though absent representatives from Germany, Switzerland, France, and Italy.There are currently no British residents in the country.Resident diplomats had previously raised their concerns about the severity of the DPRK authorities’ coronavirus-prevention rules, which saw the country close its borders and place them under effective house arrest for over a month earlier in the year.At the height of the restrictions, a request from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to fly a chartered aircraft from Britain to the country for support and evacuation purposes was rejected by the North Korean government.Lockdown measures in the country have reportedly been relaxed in recent weeks.However, the Russian state-run outlet TASS reported on Wednesday that the flag at the British embassy in Pyongyang had been taken down and a convoy of diplomatic vehicles had been seen departing.Earlier this month North Korea had said it has no cases of the coronavirus, but the country had reinforced border checks and anti-epidemic measures.An FCO spokesperson said: “The UK has temporarily closed its embassy in Pyongyang and our staff have departed the country. This decision has been made because the DPRK restrictions on entry to the country have made it impossible to rotate our staff and sustain the operation of the Embassy. “We maintain diplomatic relations with the DPRK and will seek to re-establish our presence in Pyongyang as soon as we are able to return to smooth Embassy operations. Colin Crooks remains our Ambassador to the DPRK”.“We have advised against all but essential travel to North Korea since August 2017.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cruise ship study shows 80 per cent covid 19 cases board asymptomatic","story":"Coronavirus infection without symptoms might be more common than previously thought, according to a study of people isolated on a cruise ship during the pandemic.More than 80 per cent of the passengers and crew on the unnamed cruise ship who tested positive for Covid-19 were asymptomatic.The prevalence of the virus on affected cruise ships is therefore likely to be significantly underestimated, the study published in the journal Thorax concludes.Strategies are needed to assess and monitor all passengers to prevent community transmission after disembarkation, the Australia-based researchers said.Professor Alan Smyth, joint editor-in-chief of the journal, said the study\u0027s results could have implications for the easing of lockdown restrictions if more people than previously thought have already had the virus.Of the 217 passengers and crew on board, 128 tested positive for the virus and of those, 104 patients - 81 per cent - did not have symptoms.The ship left in mid-March from Argentina for a planned 21-day cruise of the Antarctic, along a similar route taken by explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton in the early 1900s.It set sail after the global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and two of the study authors happened to be passengers, while a third was the expedition physician.Passengers and crew were screened for Covid-19 symptoms, body temperatures were taken before boarding, and no-one who had recently travelled through countries with high infection rates at the time such as China and South Korea was allowed on.The first recorded fever on board the ship was on day eight and the study authors said from that point all passengers were confined to their cabins and surgical masks were issued, while full personal protective equipment was used for any contact with any patients with a fever.Eight people had to be medically evacuated from the ship and the authors said there had been one death to date.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing planet normal new telegraph podcast talks normal","story":"Sick of gotcha political coverage?

Bored of endlessly cynical mainstream broadcasters?Then this is the podcast you’ve been looking for: Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.Yet Pearson and Halligan have much in common. They both boast high-level political access – and lace politics into their writing, although rarely from a “Westminster village” perspective. They both have older children and, unlike so many London-centric journalists, live outside the M25.What unites them, above all, is that Pearson and Halligan are staunchly and proudly “normal” – both hailing from unflashy, proletarian, non-professional backgrounds, the first in their respective families to go to university. That’s one reason they share a reputation for shrewd political analysis and trend-spotting - knowing in their bones, often before the Westminster crowd, how “ordinary people” think.“You know that moment when you’re watching a TV panel discussion and finally – finally! – someone says something you agree with,” says Pearson. “That’s what Planet Normal is all about!”Pearson and Halligan have between them spent almost forty years penning national newspaper columns, winning countless awards for their writing and broadcasting. They both feel strongly that the media is now far less representative of the broader UK population than when they started out.“It’s become much harder in recent years for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into high-end journalism,” says Halligan. “We\u0027ve made progress in terms of gender and ethnic ersity, but there’s now far less ersity in terms of opinion – with much of the broadcast media, in particular, dominated by privileged insiders holding the same approved views”.Planet Normal is a small but spirited attempt to counter that. In their 30-minute weekly podcast, Pearson and Halligan will review the news in the same sharp, irreverent, down-to-earth style they bring to their writing. The emphasis will be on calling out pomposity, lifting the lid on reality and countering political spin.And, on their trips to Planet Normal, Pearson and Halligan will be bringing along fabulous guests for the ride, representing all parts of the news cosmos – from politics to showbiz, from finance to culture – while responding to questions from Planet Normal listeners.Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.To make sure you never miss an episode, subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, or search \u0027Planet Normal\u0027 on your podcast app.Join Liam Halligan and Allison Pearson in the comments section of this article at 1pm (BST) today to discuss their new podcast and more.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"orwellian atrocity telegraph readers newsnight emily maitlis","story":"BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis failed to appear on the programme on Wednesday evening after the BBC said her monologue about Dominic Cummings breached impartiality guidelines. Ms Maitlis caused a political storm opening the BBC Two programme with the words: Dominic Cummings broke the rules. The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot. The BBC admitted that Maitlis\u0027s monologue did not meet our standards of due impartiality.Read on to see what your fellow  readers have to say and then share your own opinions in the comments section below.Newsnight is a totally pointless biased diatribe of left-wing liberal wokery, as is the presenter. The sooner the programme and presenter are dropped, the better.I can’t wait to see the BBC privatised and the licence fee eliminated.No sane person still believes the BBC is impartial as I am sure we will shortly find when the Brexit extension or another referendum campaign starts shortly.The Conservatives largely have themselves to blame for continuing to allow left-wing figures to dominate senior positions in public sector organisations.It\u0027s so sad, that we see this level of unprofessional polemic described as \u0027savage journalism\u0027 by one Maitlis admirer. I\u0027m a BBC supporter but they are going to be \u0027cut loose\u0027 soon and it\u0027ll be their own darned fault.During the 2016 referendum campaign the BBC was scrupulously fair. Once the result came in, however, all bets were off. Dimbleby’s ashen face appeared to be a signal to anyone at the BBC to begin working against the result.Maitlis’s intemperate and incautious monologue was emblematic of that tendency.More evidence, as if we needed it, that this row is nothing to do with lockdown rules, but everything to do with Brexit.And the BBC is lapping it up. Shame on them.Over a year ago, when the BBC\u0027s anti-Brexit prejudice became too much, we cancelled our licence fee and registered as listed non-payers.Signing up to this register and cutting the coax in the wall meant we could only watch non-live broadcast content, including Amazon Prime movies or Now TV.  Reading of this latest Orwellian atrocity makes it all seem worthwhile.I have remnants of nostalgia for the once world-renowned BBC. The days of Frost, Day, Walden. The superb drama and documentaries. The informative and thought-provoking news items.But, sadly, those days are gone.Ms Maitlis is fully entitled to her views, and in this country, thank goodness, the ability to express them freely. There are multiple organs of communication where she can do so freely and openly.However the BBC as a publicly funded broadcaster is not one of those communication vehicles. Ms Maitlis is unquestionably a good journalist with a commendable track record in investigative reporting. The BBC management and editorial team are well aware of this. The anger directed at her is understandable (especially the hypocrisy of her position on this and Cummings), but it is the editorial team that should shoulder the blame. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel restrictions air bridges could place end june","story":"The Prime Minister has given fresh hope that British holidaymakers could travel overseas this summerWhen can we go on holiday again? Can I take a UK holiday yet?  Will holidays be cheaper after coronavirus? For when should I reschedule my holiday?Boris Johnson has revived hopes that an overseas summer holiday could still be on the cards in 2020, after suggesting that the UK could have \u0027air bridge\u0027 agreements in place by June 29.Air bridges would allow British holidaymakers to travel to certain countries without the need to quarantine on arrival, or when they return home.Speaking last night at the Commons Liaison Committee, the Prime Minister said he wanted to keep flows as generous as we can.The Conservative chair of the transport select committee, Huw Merriman, asked:  Many people have commented that a sensible regime would look at the countries and their R rate and if it\u0027s below ours, then there should be no need for quarantine.Whilst that may not be possible for June 8, will that be possible for the next three week period which is June 29, to allow those buying cheaper flights for their summer holidays, which have gone on sale today, to be removed from the threat of quarantine?To this Mr Johnson replied: Yes, absolutely – we want to make sure we use the three-week reviews to be sensible – we want to drive the R down as fast as we can in this country and to have as sensible a quarantine scheme as possible and to keep flows as generous as we can.The Prime Minister added that the UK will have to make progress in tackling the disease, and to have evidence that other countries are in as good a position as the UK, before any air bridges could be agreed.As it stands, British holidaymakers must go into a compulsory 14-day quarantine when returning to the UK, as of June 8. Failure to observe the rules could result in a £1,000 fixed-penalty notice in England. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel.Wondering which countries the UK might form an air bridge with?

Our expert on the ground, Fiona Flores-Watson, popped out for dinner:Yesterday I ventured out for dinner on the Alameda, a tree-lined avenue in the north-west of the historic centre crammed with places to sup, sip and take a spin on the dancefloor, as well as children’s play areas. This was my first trip in two months into the city centre previous excursions had been limited to local supermarkets, vet and chemist, but no alfresco glasses of wine or tapas, two of the things which make life worth living here in southern Spain.Use of masks is obligatory if you’re within two metres of people outdoors and in indoor public spaces. Arriving in the centre, I could see that less than half of the Seville residents had their noses and mouths covered, although under the minimum distance from each other. The Alameda wasn’t as busy as usual, but still had its customary relaxed, friendly vibe with dogs, families, the young and the young-at-heart. Things are reopening in Seville, after months of lockdownRead the full article here.A new survey, commissioned by Timetastic, of 2002 full-time workers in the UK has shown that the majority have no interest in travelling overseas for the foreseeable future, and instead are eyeing up domestic holidays.How are you feeling about taking a holiday in 2020?

Here, we round up the very best places that are planning to reopen, county by county – though do note that this is still a provisional plan, depending on the next phase of lockdown and subsequent governmental announcements. Here, we look at the most exciting hotel reopenings.... with mandatory masks – and no character meetings.Florida will have to wait until July 11 for a phased return of Walt Disney World, after Orlando’s theme park king-pin announced its grand reopening plans for more than a month after local rivals Universal and SeaWorld.Entry requirements will include a temperature check on arrival, a face covering, and observation of strict social distancing markers being added throughout all four parks.

We can’t wait to safely bring visitors to the city and remind them why we’ve earned the title of ‘Entertainment Capital of the World.’ And while we’d love for visitors to stop by Downtown Las Vegas, we primarily want to get people back to Las Vegas to experience the attractions and amenities that make it one of the greatest places on Earth.”Here\u0027s a glimpse of what Vegas will look like when it reopens.This was meant to be the year of Airbnb. Not only was it one of the most anticipated public floats of 2020, its ever expanding portfolio of properties showed no sign of slowing down. That is, until coronavirus hit, and many were forced to cancel their travel plans due to the global shutdown.But as countries around the world show signs of loosening restrictions, many fans of the platform will be wondering when it will be possible to book again.Non-essential bookings are banned until May 31, but it\u0026#39s likely to continue until July 4Unless the government issues an exception for private rentals within the UK, Airbnb will likely keep non-essential UK bookings banned until July 4. Outside the UK, however, things are much less restricted.Emma Cooke explains it all.We have seen further cancellations from cruise lines today, with one – Victory Cruise Lines, operated by American Queen Steamboat Co – scrapping its entire 2020 season, Benjamin Parker reports. The line has blamed government restrictions and uncertainties of future travel through Canadian waters.

So far, the Males has recorded five deaths and 1,457 cases, the majority in the densely-packed capital of Malé. It was also suggested that well-heeled travellers arriving by yacht or private jet will be allowed to reenter the Males from June 1, with commercial flights restarting from July 1.

We shouldn’t waste the chance to start again from scratch,” said Matteo Secchi from Venessia, a pressure group that campaigns to protect the city’s identity and stem the flow of residents from the centre.Usually packed with tourists, the Rialto Bridge has been empty during lockdownIn 2008 the group installed a digital counter in a shop window near the Rialto Bridge so that Venetians could witness their exodus.

The committee accused the government of not listening to its own scientific advice as it pushes for certain classes to go back to school on 1 June.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government’s scientific advisory committee, Sage, has modelled the impact of seven different ways schools could reopen, which all result in the ‘R’ rate – or the rate of transmission – increasing, the group said. “The school reopening scenario chosen by the government is not one of those modelled by Sage making the potential impact of reopening even more uncertain,” the Independent Sage report said. “Robust testing systems are not in place everywhere.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The committee of independent scientists added: “Additionally, public adherence to social distancing is influenced by trust in the government and its messaging. This trust is increasingly strained.“We therefore believe that by going ahead with a general school reopening from 1 June, the government is not following the advice of its Sage group.” Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser, set up Independent Sage to look at how the UK could work its way out of coronavirus lockdown after the official Sage faced criticism over an alleged lack of transparency. He claimed the new board was necessary because he feared experts were deferring to ministers.Speaking about the plans to reopen schools on 1 June, Sir David said: “Whilst we totally understand the imperative to get the nation’s children back in the classroom as soon as it is safe to do so, the evidence clearly shows that the government has jumped the gun here.”He added: “Crucially we conclude that the best way forward cannot be one size fits all, it requires localised case by case responses to ensure that the risk of flair ups is kept to a minimum.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Building features to combat that would require the company to sacrifice engagement – and by extension, profit – according to a later document from 2018 which described the proposals as “antigrowth” and requiring “a moral stance.”“Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to isiveness,” a 2018 presentation warned, warning that if action was not taken Facebook would provide users “more and more isive content in an effort to gain user attention \u0026amp increase time on the platform.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to a report from the Wall Street Journal, in 2017 and 2018 Facebook conducted research through newly created “Integrity Teams” to tackle extremist content and a cross-jurisdictional task force dubbed “Common Ground.”The Common Ground team was intended to tackle polarisation directly, said people familiar with the team, although its intentions were “explicitly not going to build products that attempt to change people’s beliefs,” but to create products that increase empathy, understanding, and humanization of the ‘other side’” according to a 2018 document.Trump to sign executive order pursuing social media giantsThe project was particularly concerned about private groups following a 2016 presentation by a Facebook researcher that found extremist content in more than one-third of large German political groups, most of which were private and so their content was not visible to outside members, on the social media site.These groups were disproportionately influenced by a small coterie of hyperactive users, with the presentation stating that the majority of people joining extremist groups were encouraged by Facebook’s algorithm. “Our recommendation systems grow the problem,” the presentation said.While Facebook was dedicated to neutrality, deciding that the social media site should not police users’ opinions or vilify users’ political opponents, according to internal documents, it was suggested that Facebook change its algorithm to suggest a wider range of Facebook groups or adding a feature to create smaller communities within Facebook Groups where political arguments could be held.However, Facebook executives including chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg “largely shelved the basic research, according to previously unreported internal documents and people familiar with the effort, and weakened or blocked efforts to apply its conclusions to Facebook products.”Facebook\u0027s vice president of global public policy Joel Kaplan argued that such actions were “paternalistic” at a time when disapproval from Kaplan’s team would dissolve a project, said people familiar with its development.Negative reviews from the policy team reportedly stopped a classification system for hyperpolarising content. Efforts to suppress clickbait about politics were also shut down.Russia interfered in 2016 to back Trump, new Senate report confirmsCarlos Uribe, who led the newsfeed Integrity Team at the time, attempted to push “Sparing Sharing,” which would have reduced the reach of content from hyperactive users – who were usually far more partisan than average users and engaged in behaviour similar to spammers. Uribe did not comment to the Wall Street Journal, but did confirm that he supported the Sparing Sharing proposal. Facebook researchers suggested that it could bolster the platform\u0027s defence against spam and manipulation like that which had allowed interference from Russia during the 2016 presidential election.However, Kaplan and other Facebook executives pushed back on Uribe’s proposal, saying that mitigating the ability of Facebook’s most dedicated users to push content would unfairly affect them – hypothesising about a Girl Scout troop who became super-sharers by promoting cookies as an example.Zuckerberg says Twitter shouldn\u0027t be \u0027arbiter of truth\u0027Facebook announces oversight board to decide free speech controversiesMark Zuckerberg says Facebook ‘slow to understand’ Russian operationsFacebook gives insight into how future workspaces could lookWhat has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?While Zuckerberg approved a weakened version of the program, he reportedly said that he was losing interest in the effort to change the platform for the good of its users and asked not to have that subject brought to him again. Smaller changes were made to the platform, including efforts to promote news stories from a large user base and penalties for publishers who shared fake news.Uribe since left the company because of frustration with executives, and said that while proposals in the US would affect conservatives it would affect opposite groups in other countries. The Common Ground team was disbanded, and while the Integrity Teams still exist many senior staffers either left Facebook entirely or moved to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.In response to the report, Facebook has said in a blog post that the Wall Street Journal wilfully ignored critical facts that undermined its narrative which, the company says, includes changes to the News Feed, limiting the reach of Pages and Groups that breach Facebook\u0027s standards or share fake news, combating hate speech and misinformation, and building a robust Integrity Team.This news comes while Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order to target social media sites after Twitter added a fact-checking label to his tweets claming that postal voting would result in a fraudulent election. The president claimed that social media sites are biased against right-wing voices, a topic which is hotly debated.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allowances are more generous for couples and families, but remain lower than in many other European countries.Businesses could find their recovery hampered by high levels of debt built up to get them through the worst of the crisis.Banks have approved “bounce back” loans totalling £18.5bn for 465,000 smaller businesses. The loans of up to £50,000 are 100 per cent guaranteed by the state and require minimal checks before approval.A further £8.2bn has been lent under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) to 43,045 companies.CBILS loans are backed to 80 per cent by the government and require banks to carry out checks on the borrowers. A similar scheme for larger businesses has lent £820m to 154 companies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The weather got us.The launch date has now been moved to Saturday at 8:22 pm UK time.Mr Bridenstine added: But I also wanted to say this was really a great day for Nasa it was a great day for SpaceX.

In just a few short days on Saturday afternoon we are going to do it again.Here is what we know - we are going to launch American astronauts on an American rocket from American soil. We are going to do that. We are very close.While the conditions were improved shortly after the launch was scrubbed, the teams went ahead with the postponement because the launch window was instantaneous, which meant the spacecraft would have had to leave on time to rendezvous with the space station.Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley had to remain strapped in their seats until all the fuel in their rocket was unloaded and the emergency escape system was disarmed.Before exiting the Crew Dragon capsule, Mr Hurley, who is the commander of the spacecraft, said: We could see some raindrops on the windows and just figured that whatever it was, was too close to the launch pad at the time we needed it not to be.Understand that everybody\u0027s probably a little bit bummed out. That\u0027s just part of the deal.British astronaut Tim Peake said it was a shame that the SpaceX launch was scrubbed but added the rules are there in the interest of safety.The mission, named Demo-2, would have seen SpaceX become the first private company to send astronauts into space.Since ending its Space Shuttle programme in 2011, Nasa has depended on Russia\u0027s space agency Roscosmos to transport its astronauts to the space station.In 2014, Nasa awarded SpaceX and Boeing contracts to provide crewed launch services to the space station as part of its Commercial Crew Program.According to Nasa, the aim of the Demo-2 mission to show SpaceX\u0027s ability to ferry astronauts to the space station and back safely.It is the final major step required by SpaceX\u0027s astronaut carrier, the Crew Dragon, to get certified by Nasa\u0027s Commercial Crew Program for more long-term manned missions to space.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers found 70 per cent of parents do not have any type of external support in providing care and education for their children.The study, which polled 3,055 working parents in the UK, America, France, Germany, and Italy, found similar gendered patterns in other countries too.Researchers found women with children across these countries now spend an average of 65 hours a week on unpaid labour around the house — with this figure having almost doubled since the Covid-19 crisis. This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hundreds of thousands have added their names days after it emerged Dominic Cummings had travelled from London to Durham in April to be close to potential childcare and then to nearby town Barnard Castle.The number of people who had signed the petition on Change.org – called ‘”Dominic Cummings must be sacked” – stood at around 908,726 on Thursday morning. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe prime minister has backed his top aide during the controversy, saying on Wednesday it was time to “move on” from allegations the senior advisor broke rules of the lockdown over coronavirus. Most of the British public think Mr Cummings should quit, according to a poll conducted earlier this week after the aide’s televised speech explaining his movements.  Created with Sketch.Newspapers react after Johnson stands by Cummings Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Seventy-one per cent of people in the YouGov survey thought the PM’s chief advisor had ignored government regulations when he drove more than 200 miles to his parents’ estate in Durham at the height of the lockdown. Meanwhile, 59 per cent of those polled thought Mr Cummings should quit his post. Scores of Conservative MPs have called for the PM’s chief advisor to be sacked or to resign. In a press conference on Monday, the government aide defended travelling from London to Durham with his family in April, saying he believed he behaved “reasonably”.He said they drove north to be near family who had offered childcare in case him and his wife became too ill to look after their four-year-old son.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Cummings is also a father. Parenting is a great leveller.No matter who you are, or how much power you yield, your child comes first.Haven’t we all felt that desperate panic at trying to juggle work and childcare That and being the right hand man to the Prime Minister in the middle of a pandemic, the most challenging situation this nation has faced since World War Two.As a mum-of-two author of What’s My Child Thinking , I also know that finding childcare for four-year-olds is not easy.They have strong opinions about who they will be left with and find it hard to be separated from their parents.By doing this Cummings had peace of mind that were he and his we to be both hospitalised with the disease, then their four-year-old would be taken care of.He looked tense, scared and panicked by the force of hatred against him.A firing squad looked like it would have been only a mildly easier option.But I wonderthe polarisation of this country is now so great that hatred has now blinded us to the fact that public figures are often parents too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One of fury, contempt and anguish.He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can now flout them.The Prime Minister knows all this, but despite the resignation of one minister, growing unease from his backbenchers, a dramatic early warning from the polls, and a deep national disquiet, Boris Johnson has chosen to ignore it.Tonight we consider what this blind loyalty tells us about the workings of Number .Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith slammed her comments, and warned it was not the job of presenters to offer a personal opinion.He told The Sun: “It’s quite wrong of an interviewer to express their own views using a  they have been fortunate to get.“The charter is very clear that the BBC is not to express its own personal opinions.”Tory MP Michael Fabricant said: The BBC is supposed to present news in an unbiased way without a personal commentary.Newsnight is meant to do just that: present news and interviews.

Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross resigned in protest.Almost  backbench Tory MPs have also publicly called for the Vote Leave guru to step down.Some have been spooked by polls showing the PM’s approval rating has plummeted by  per cent and that more than half of the public think Mr Cummings should quit.A Savanta ComRes poll shows Mr Johnson’s rating has dropped to minus one.The Government’s approval is down by  per cent.And a YouGov poll shows  per cent of Brits say Mr Cummings did break lockdown and  per cent think he should resign."},{"url":null,"title":"kayaker final plea facebook aus","story":"The body of Jeremy Worthy, , was found floating dead near Batemans Bay on the south coast of New South Wales on Sunday.Jeremy became “swamped” by a ferocious swell meaning the current was pushing him away from shore.In his last moments, Jeremy uploaded a final plea for help to Facebook at .pm in the hope of being rescued.He said: “This is tiring, pushing me where I dont want to go.“Sitting here thinking, who wants to be an embarrassed fool, to ring marine rescue.“Its not very peaceful, not very calming.”Jeremy had been trying to get back to Snapper Island, near Batemans Bay , as the strong winds and tides forced him back.After his video plea, he posted a map of his location but with no description.Rescue workers were called to the beach at around ,pm – nine minutes after the kayaker posted his distress call online.An empty kayak was later found by a member of the public before Jeremys body was found between Square Head and Sandy Place, reports Yahoo.CPR was performed by paramedics but they were unable to save Jeremy, NSW Police said.Family and friends have paid tribute to the kayaker on social media saying he will be “missed by all”.One pal wrote: “I cant stop watching this video.

I was only there for a stroll in the park and I recognised Anna and her sister.“I could see some tension between them and another group and I thought it was going to kick off.“There was swearing and shouting from the group of girls. I thought it might be because of who they were. But something clearly happened.“I could see one of the girls Anna and Mandi were with had been attacked and moments later that’s when Mandi struck one of the girls in the group twice.“Anna didn’t get physical but was there and involved in the furious argument at the start.“She was on a scooter and they had a dog with them. It was a furious argument with the group of girls. There was finger pointing, shouting and screaming. It got heated.“Then Anna was with Mandi when they approached the girl and Mandi struck her twice.“This was after the girl they were with had been put on the floor after being struck. I think they were trying to defend that girl. It was a messy situation.A spokesman for Anna told Sun Online: Anna and Mandi Vakili and others in their group were involved in an unprovoked violent and verbal attack on Monday in Hyde Park which included Mandi and their cousin being hit and punched and the group of attackers attempting to steal their belongings.The very serious matter is now being dealt with the police as they were threatened with illegal weapons during the attack.”A Met police spokesman said: We are aware of an allegation of assault in Hyde Park, on Monday,  May, at approximately pm.“We will attempt to contact the complainant to establish the circumstances.”Last month, Anna revealed she had ed to work as a pharmacist during the coronavirus crisis. She previously quit her job to appear on the ITV dating show last summer.Explaining her decision, she told fans: “First day back working as a pharmacist since leaving Love Island. It’s been almost a whole year! Wow can’t believe how fast it’s gone.“Wasn’t really planning on registering yet but with everything that’s going on it felt wrong not to. We can all fight this together. Stay safe. Stay home. Save lives.”She took to Instagram to share a snap of herself behind the counter for the first time in nearly a year.Mandi is described as a “beauty guru” and a “social media influencer” and lives in London.She acted as Anna’s social media representation while she was in the villa over the summer,The lookalike sisters are often mistaken for twins and spend a lot of time together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again. Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus. And then he discovered the laws of gravity.Oh, and formulated a theory of light which dominated science for the next century and beyond. All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France. Good for her.Since the turn of the year more than , illegal immigrants have arrived on our shores from our neighbours.Brexit Britain is an even more popular destination than it was before we left the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than a third said they would bring the majority of their furloughed workers back part-time from August.Mr Sunak has already announced that employers will be able to furlough staff part-time, but has yet to announce details of how this will work.Jonathan Geldart, boss of the IoD, said: The furlough scheme is protecting millions of jobs. Business leaders know that the Governments support cant be infinite, but the ugly truth is thattheres no money coming in the door, many firms will be forced to make dficult decisions come August.Directors will be fighting tooth and nail to avoid this scenario. There is hope that as more areas of the economyto work, more companies can keep people on board.However, despite best efforts, many firms simply wont be able to work at full capacity for the foreseeable future and theres no magic wand to lt demand back up again.The Government must soften the blow by introducing as much flexibility as possible into the furlough system. The more flexible the scheme is, the better firms can recover, and the fewer jobs will rely on state subsidy.With the prospect of job losses and businesses struggling to create new roles in the months ahead, the spotlight will be on our training system.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the reproduction number of the virus.He said: We don’t know until we see more evidence of the R effect continuing to reduce.Government scientists are meeting today to check whether the five tests have been met and they can safely go back.We do want young children to come back into schoolthe science indicates that its safe to do so, he added.Echoing education secretary Gavin Williamsons call for a cautious approach in reopening, Mr Gibb said the key was assuring that ing children to school does not result in an increase in the R factor.The Prime Ministers announcement earlier this month that it was the governments ambition to reopen schools was initially met with a furious backlash from teaching unions and local councils.More than  councils claimed they would refuse to reopen on June , citing safety concerns, and would either advise against opening or leave the decision in the hands of headteachers.But Mr Gibb appeared optimistic when asked about a potential stand-off between Westminster and councils.He told the committee: I am confident the vast majority of local authorities are planning to open for Reception, Year  and Year  on June , and for young people in Year  and Year  to come back for part of the time for face-to-face teaching.Last night the Prime Minister said while he “would like to reopen schools before the summer holidays, the decision was dependent upon the R rate.It comes as education secretary Gavin Williamson admitted at Tuesdays press conference that only “small numbers” of children will head back to class when England reopens its schools.Official government guidance requires schools to reorganise buildings to allow a maximum of  children in class.Mr Williamson also said “nervous” parents will not be punishedthey keep their kids home.But he added that the Covid- crisis could last another year and schools must start gradually reopening to stop kids falling “tragically” behind.Primaries will be allowed to stay shut past June  onlythey have “practical problems” sorting out the new class size cap, he said.Mr Williamson went on: “When you see other countries around the world who are quite a number of weeks ahead of us in terms of bringing schools back, you see small numbers of pupils in school for the first few weeks.“And then that rapidly starts to increase when people realise how much their children are missing out by not being in school.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.But the government have insisted they are taking a cautious approach by only sending a few year groups back into schools from next week.Equally, Mr Williamson claims that -

Weve seen what happens when this virus gets out of control.The news comes just hours after Boris Johnson told MPs last night he was looking at so-called air bridges with other countries in future.He was grilled by MPs today on whether the nation could be able to take advantage of cheap flights being released, as air travel prepares to start up again following the coronavirus crisis.He was asked by MP Huw Merriman what would need to change between now and the end of next month for that to happen.We will have to agree them with the other counties concerned, and we will also have to make progress on fighting the disease, he replied.We will have to have evidence that the other countries are at least in as a good a position as we are.It could give hope that Brits may not have to go into quarantine for  daysthey visit a certain country with a low infection rate.Already Portugal and Greece are hopeful that exceptions may be able to be madethe virus is able to be controlled enough.Brits coming back into the UK at the moment will face a two-week quarantine from the start of June, as part of attempts to control the spread of the virus into the country.However, it will be reviewed every three weeks as part of efforts to keep flows as generous as we can, Boris stressed.At the moment the Foreign Office travel advice is that nothing but essential travel out of the country should happen while the world fights the virus.But already the airline industry is preparing to reopen the skies and put on more flights.And Europes tourist hotspots are planning for how to reopen again to visitors from around the world.Ryanair is set to launch , daily flights by July, with routes to popular destinations including Spain, Greece and Portugal.The low-cost airline will restart routes to Europe from July .Flights can now be booked from July onwards, with flights to Spain and France starting from \"£. each way.Temperature checks will be conducted at airport entry and wearing face masks or coverings at all times in the terminal and on board aircraft. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Anyone who doesnt pass the temperature check will be removed from the terminal, and masks will be given to those who dont have them.British Airways also hopes to resume flights by July, although warned that the mandatory -day quarantine may force it to postpone.EasyJet hopes to restart its flight schedule as soon as June .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On  April , Mr Cummings drove approximately  miles from his father’s property to Barnard Castle with his we and son. He stated on  May  that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castleand have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the Regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings toto the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.In line with Durham Constabulary’s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings dferently from other members of the public.Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on  April . Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.The PM has backed his aide, saying he acted lawfully and reasonably to protect his child.Mr Cummings made the trip alongside his we, Mary Wakefield, who become ill before him.The pair self-isolated with their son at a farm house near his parents - but they never came into contact with them.Boris Johnson has insisted he will stick by his aide and he believes he acted reasonably and with integrity.Yesterday he urged the nation to move on from the row and get on with dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month.

The popular host was absent from Wednesday nightaposs broadcast after the BBC ruled the programme breached impartiality rules over its coverage of Boris Johnsonaposs top aide. In her introduction to Tuesdayaposs show, she said the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser had broken the rules and the country can see that, and itaposs shocked the Government cannot. The BBC said while Maitlis had been scheduled to present last nightaposs edition of the programme, Katie Razzall would take her place. However, in the early hours of Thursday morning Emily tweeted to say it was her decision not to appear on the show. She said: So grateful to my friend and excellent colleague Katie Razzall for stepping in this evening . She did so because I asked for the night off - knowing tonight’s prog would be in the most excellent hands. [sic] Newsnight editor Esme Wren said on Twitter Maitlis had not been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement and that the programmeaposs staff work as a team throughout. Razzall also said her fellow presenter had not been asked by the BBC to take tonight off, adding that she certainly wouldnapost have agreed to present the showshe thought that was the case. In the Newsnight opening, Maitlis said: The longer ministers and the Prime Minister tell us he worked within [the rules], the more angry the response to this scandal is likely to be. He was the man, remember, who always got the public mood, who tagged the lazy label of elite on those who disagreed. He should understand that public mood now - one of fury, contempt and anguish. The National Union of Journalists criticised the BBC over its handling of the row. General secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: At a time of national crisis, frank and fearless journalism that scrutinises and holds this Government to account is more necessary than ever. She said it was clear as day that Mr Cummings breached lockdown rules, adding: Journalists should be congratulated for holding policymakers to account for actions that risk a monumental breach of trust during a public health crisis. The BBC said in a statement on Wednesday staff had been reminded of the guidelines around impartiality following the broadcast, adding that the corporation must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output. The statement added: Weaposve reviewed the entirety of last nightaposs Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme. As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan branded the BBC statement utterly disgraceful, adding that the BBC is chucking one of its best journalists under the bus for telling the truth.

It could see healthy Brits forced to self-isolate at homethey have been in contact with a confirmed case. Call handlers will interview those in England who have tested positive and ask for details of anyone they have recently been near. Recent contacts who do not have symptoms will be called and asked to self-isolate at home for  days. Close contact is defined as being closer than metres to someone with symptoms for more than  minutes. Data will be analysed to decide whether workplaces, schools, housing estates or blocks of flats need to be locked down to quell local outbreaks. As the NHS test and trace app is not ready yet, all tracing will be performed manually. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with inidual isolation and,necessary, local action where there are outbreaks. “NHS Test and Trace will be vital to stopping the spread of the virus. It is how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\" “This new system will help us keep this virus under control while carefully and safely lting the lockdown nationally.” The NHS has set up a new website nhs.uk coronavirus and launched a new dedicated phone number  for people to report symptoms and get tested. It comes after a series of hastily-arranged online briefings with journalists. It is understood the Government brought forward the launch amid the growing scandal surrounding Dominic Cummings breach of lockdown rules.  England has gone it alone before similar contact tracing networks are launched in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The NHS contact tracing app is thought to be weeks away from being ready for national roll-out. The original plan had been to launch the app alongside the , human contact tracers who will go live tomorrow It will use Bluetooth to detect mobile phones belonging to other app-users and noty the owner that they have been close to someone who has tested positive.

Baroness Dido Harding, the chair of the NHS Test and Trace Service, refused to give a date when the app would be ready. “This is a huge new public service that we are standing up,” she told a press briefing on Wednesday. “I’m sure there are stuff that we’re going to learn when we go live tomorrow. We will continue to test and learn over the next few days and weeks. “I fully expect there are things that we can do better as we aim to build an NHS Test and Trace Service that is world class. It’s not going to be world class on day one.” She added: “I see the app as the cherry on the cake, not the cake itself.” From Thursday anyone with symptoms in England will be able to access a testthey need one. Wales will follow from Saturday. The Government says it has the capacity to trace the contacts of , people who test positive each day.  Experts believe there are also around , new coronavirus infections daily. However there are thought to be around , people currently suffering with symptoms similar to Covid- but who do not have it. Rapid testing capacity will be crucial according to modelling by the Royal Society. Its Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicscommittee found test track and trace would need to be carried out in three days to be effective. South Korea has averaged a two-to-three day turnaround. This includes a suspected case being tested, getting their results, being interviewed and having their contacts traced and also advised to self-isolate. Government testing tsar Prof John Newton confirmed the UK was aiming for this three-day turn around.  Prof Newton, Public Health England’s health improvement director, said: “Each inidual will have their risk assessed, which is why it’s quite a labour intensive process. “We are not doing for workplaces, for example, saying thatyou’re a teacher then anyone in that school is a ‘contact’. It’s going to be on inidual risk.” He said this should prevent “overreaction” and the “taking out of businesses” unncessarily. Someone will generally be deemed a “contact”they have been closer than one metre to a positive case, or between one and two metres away for at least  minutes. A new Joint Biosecurity Centre has been launched to work with local authorities to identy localised outbreaks. Mobile testing facilities could then be set up. Public Health England suggested in March regional lockdowns could be applied to towns and cities although this was not mentioned in the announcement. Hospital bosses have warned that local health officials have not been told how they fit in to the Government’s plan. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: “We need to build local test and trace capacity and that is simply not going to be in place.” It is unclear how GPs, district nurses and other health professionals can access testing data about local outbreaks. It comes amid plans to reopen schools and more sectors of the economy from Monday. Worrying findings from a contact tracing study in Sheffield found two thirds of Covid- patients did not fully cooperate. Many involved were care professionals amid suspicions people not entitled to sick pay were less likely to self-isolate.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailLet’s begin with something Boris Johnson can’t bring himself to say but the rest of us know: Dominic Cummings broke the rules. It is as simple as that. His actions were an insult to the millions of people across Britain who have sacriced so much during this pandemic. In recent months, families have been forced to make the most agonising of decisions. People have been unable to see loved ones. Grandparents have been denied the chance to hold newborn grandchildren. Some of the most vulnerable in society have had to isolate alone. In the most tragic circumstances, people haven’t been able to say goodbye at the funerals of friends or loved ones.  The lockdown has been dficult for us all. There is no denying that. We miss each other. But, people have obeyed the rules because they understand the importance of our shared common goal our national purpose. Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. That’s why, when the revelations about Dominic Cummings’ behaviour broke over the weekend, people were angry. And during the endless hours of press conferences over the Bank Holiday weekend, people were looking for an apology, a resignation or a plausible explanation from Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings about what happened. None was forthcoming.  Instead, we got a very simple message: it is one rule for them, another rule for everybody . I share people’s frustrations, not just because of the actions of one adviser, but because this has become a national distraction at a moment of national crisis. This was the week when we should have been talking about how we ease the lockdown safely. How we restart our economy, support businesses, get more children back to school.  Instead, the Prime Minister’s unwillingness or inability to do the right thing has left the Government looking untrustworthy, unprincipled. And worst of all they have undermined the very public health advice that is necessary to keep us all safe, just to keep one powerful aide in his job. In times like this, we need good government. A government that we can trust. A government that is entirely focused on saving lives. So, I say to the Prime Minister: we cannot go on like this. We cannot lose another week to this farce. We need to get back on track. When I was elected leader of the Labour Party, I made a promise to the British people. That I would work constructively with the Government. Challenging them when I thought mistakes were being made, offering my support when that was the right thing to do. I stand by that promise. That is why I will work constructively with the Government to help us through the next phase of this pandemic. The Prime Minister has promised a ‘world-beating’ test, track and trace system, when in fact what most people are looking for is a system that will work and will keep them safe. For Labour, that means rapidly increasing the amount of testing to at least a quarter of a million a day. It means recruiting an army of over , so-called ‘contract tracers’. And it means a nationwide phone app up and running by the  June, as we were previously promised. For the British people, it also means providing reassurance at time of huge anxiety. If you or a family member have symptoms, or you have been told to go into isolation, you want to know as soon as possible whether you have got this awful virus.

Labouraposs Rosena Allin-Khan said Mr Hancockaposs reaction was an insult to the , people who have died of Covid- - saying the need for a working test and trace system is not a joke. NHS Test and Trace will officially launch across England today with the help of , contact tracers, although an accompanying app is still delayed by several weeks. But today NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson warned very key bits of the Governmentaposs test and trace strategy are not yet in place. Mr Hancock originally said the NHSX contact tracing app would be an integral part of the system - but that has been delayed following a trial on the Isle of Wight. But Ms Burley challenged him on why Test and Trace has been rolled out now, without the app in place. She said: The problem is youaposve rushed it forward havenapost you  Because you want to take the headlines away from Dominic Cummings. Youaposve brought it forward. It should have been  June, when the app is being launched at the same time.  Mr Hancock said: Itaposs priceless, Kay. Iaposm normally accused of delaying these things, bringing them in too slowly. Itaposs, I, I committed to getting this in mid-May...itaposs just about mid-May. You canapost accuse me both of... Ms Burley interrupted: OK, you talked about the app in mid-May, didnapost you, Health Secretary, and weaposve still not got that app. Mr Hancock started to laugh loudly. You said the app was absolutely essential to this track and trace, she said. The app is still not ready until next week at the earliest. Maybe after that. Yet youaposve brought this forward. I suppose many of my viewers will think itaposs not a laughing matter. Mr Hancock said: Yes, well. I canapost quite work out whether youaposre telling me that Iaposve gone too slow or too fast. I think weaposve gone at just the right speed. Ms Burley said: I tell you what, I donapost think my viewers know. I think theyaposre as confused as I am. Clary it for us. Mr Hancock said the app was helpful and was working on the Isle of Wight. He added: But thereaposs a reason we havenapost brought it in right at the start, which is that asking people to isolate, eventheyaposre healthy, because the NHS has got in contact and informed them that they are in higher risk because theyaposve been in contact with somebody who has tested positive, that is quite a big change. One of the things we learnt in the pilot on the Isle of Wight was that getting people used to that idea is important to do before we then also add the technological capability, the app, on top.  Rosena Allin-Khan said: What an insult. At least , people have died of Covid- in the UK. [The Government] abandoned community testing. With a proper test and trace system in place months ago, thousands would have been saved. This is not a joke. This has been painful for so many families. NHS Providers Chief Chris Hopson told the BBC: Weaposre in the process of building test and trace. There will be a group of contact tracers who will be readymorning but there are still very key bits of test and trace that still need to be built. Mr Hopson said the speed of testing needed to be improved, comparing international standards of having tests back within  hours with reports of tests taking up to three to five days, as well as referencing the need to provide support locally.

He said he still hadnapost been given a password by the siteaposs launch. And it has been reported the website crashed for people to report themselves as having symptoms or crashed within minutes of going live. The contact tracer told LBCaposs Rachael Venables they had been given the impression they would be starting on June , and only learned they would be expected earlier when watching Boris Johnsonaposs evidence to the Liaison Committee last night. The system glitch has been reported as a critical incident, LBC reported. A Department of Health source said: The system has not crashed.Anyone in the country can log on and book a testthey have symptoms and we have tracers logged on to do their vital work to help stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives.As with all large scale operations of this kind, some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning laughed off suggestions the system had been rushed into launch before it was ready as a smokescreen for Dominic Cummings.The Health Secretary told Sky Newsapos Kay Burley the suggestion was priceless. Iaposm normally accused of delaying these things, bringing them in too slowly. Itaposs, I, I committed to getting this in mid-May...itaposs just about mid-May. You canapost accuse me both of... Ms Burley interrupted: OK, you talked about the app in mid-May, didnapost you, Health Secretary, and weaposve still not got that app. Mr Hancock started to laugh loudly.  You said the app was absolutely essential to this track and trace, she said. The app is still not ready until next week at the earliest. Maybe after that. Yet youaposve brought this forward. I suppose many of my viewers will think itaposs not a laughing matter. Mr Hancock said: Yes, well. I canapost quite work out whether youaposre telling me that Iaposve gone too slow or too fast.

An existing light-up digital sign bearing the government slogan stay alert, control the virus, save lives was already in place in Bridport, Dorset. But a second sign was apparently attached to the same stand, allowing a carve-out for Boris Johnsonaposs embattled aide sometime on Tuesday afternoon - reading ...except Dominic Cummings. According to Bridport News, Highways England was alerted to the errant signage this morning - but had no idea who put it there, or indeed who owned the land it was on. They said the sign is not their asset, nor is it located on the A. A spokesman for Dorset Council said: We are using temporary road signs at the request of the Department for Transport to help remind people of their responsibilities during the Covid- pandemic. It seems that a local anonymous prankster has added their opinion to one of our signs in west Dorset. The additional homemade sign is unauthorised so it will be removed. West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson says officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using special adviser Dominic Cummingsapos actions as an excuse. Meanwhile, the head of NHS Providers urged Boris Johnson to acknowledge that public trust and confidence in the social distancing measures have been dented in the last few days.And West Midlands Police Commissioner David Jamieson said lockdown breakers are using Dominic Cummings as an excuse to flout the rules, making it aposalmost impossibleapos for officers to do their job Mr Jamieson told BBC Radio aposs The World At One programme that people are telling officers thatit is okay for Cummings, it is okay for us and it looks like there is one rule for us and another rule for the people in No  Downing Street. He said: Now you canapost...the rules are flexible, and people seem to have interpreted them who are at the heart of Government, then it is almost impossible then for police officers to be able to carry out their job effectively.

We are still working through precisely how this will work, and our approach may evolve in line with Government guidance, so please bear with us, the spokesperson added.

But how much is our Monarch actually worth  Back in , her Majesty ranked th on the Sunday Times Rich List. Her incredible wealth is made up of property, jewels, horses and art. According to Forbes, the Queenaposs personal net worth back in  was a staggering £million. Her husband Prince Philip is thought to have a personal wealth of about £million. The following year, the Sunday Times calculated the value of the entire Royal Family - which theyaposve estimated at billion, which is about £billion. However working out the Queenaposs finances is far from simple, as there are many restrictions and technicalities on some of the things she has to her name. Many of the things she owns, she owns as Sovereign on behalf of the nation rather than owning them personally. For example, while she owns the Balmoral and Sandringham Estates personally having inherited them from her father, the official Royal residences - including Buckingham Palace - must be passed onto her successor.  This means Prince Charles will automatically own them, but again only as Sovereign, when the Queen dies. The same rules apply to many of the art treasures in the Royal Collection and most famously, the Crown Jewels. The Queen pays for her day-to-day le using three separate pots of cash - the Sovereign Grant, the Privy Purse and her personal money. The Sovereign Grant is the money the Government gives the Queen every year to support her work.  The Privy Purse is cash generated by the Duchy of Lancaster - a portfolio land, property and other assets of about , hectares in England and Wales.It has existed since  to provide an income for  the Sovereign  – who is also known as the Duke of Lancaster .But the Queen canapost do what she wants with the Duchy – it is managed and run for her – but she receives all the net profits, which is millions of pounds each year.

Virginia Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, makes the damning allegations in a Netflix documentary which was released today.The series - called Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich - is to thrust the Duke of Yorkaposs friendship with the disgraced paedophile into the spotlight once more. It features serious allegations about the Queenaposs son, who has repeatedly denied he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Roberts. She has in the past alleged she had sex with the Duke in  after being trafficked to the UK by financier Epstein.  She alleges the Duke, father to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was  - a minor under US law. He denies this. Ms Roberts also alleges in the documentary she met the Duke in the London home of Epsteinaposs associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She told interviewers for the series: Ghislaine has this favourite guessing game that she does, she goes to Prince Andrew aposhow old do you think Virginia is apos And he said .  Sheaposs like, aposOh youaposre right!apos They made a little joke about it. He was like, aposmy daughters arenapost far from your age. My daughters are a little bit younger than you.apos A former employee of Epstein has also accused the Duke of frolicking in a pool with a topless Ms Roberts on a dferent occasion.Steve Scully alleges that Andrew and Ms Roberts were engaged in foreplay in the pool on Epsteinaposs private island in the Caribbean. Scully said: Jeffrey hung out with a lot of powerful and well known figures, both politically and financially and British royalty.  It was probably around  I saw Prince Andrew, he was at the pool, he was with, at that time, an unknown girl to me, she was young, she didnapost have any top on, they were engaged in foreplay, he was grabbing her and grinding against her. Mr Scully, who said he maintained Epsteinaposs telecommunications and data equipment on Little Saint James Island in the US Virgin Islands, added: You tell yourself that you didnapost know for sure and you never really saw anything but thataposs just all rationalisation. Jeffrey Epstein, he was a guy that concealed his deviance very well, but he didnapost conceal it that well.  Meanwhile, Ms Roberts has urged Andrew to come forward and be interviewed by FBI and US prosecutors about his friendship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who committed suicide in jail while facing sex trafficking charges. US lawyer Geoffrey Berman, who is leading the Epstein inquiry, said in March: Contrary to Prince Andrewaposs very public offer to co-operate with our investigation into Epsteinaposs co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary co-operation and our office is considering its options. The duke stepped down from royal duties last November following a disastrous Newsnight interview about his friendship with Epstein.  In the programme, Andrew responded to claims made by Ms Roberts that the night they allegedly had sex he was sweating heavily as they danced in Londonaposs Tramp nightclub. The duke said he did not recall meeting her and had a medical condition at the time, after suffering an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when he was shot at, that meant he did not sweat. Interviewed for the documentary, Ms Giuffre said about Andrew: This guy didnapost have any remorse at all.

This afternoon First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that the country would begin easing social restrictions first put in place on March . From Friday people will be able to meet up with friends and relatives from other households, one household at a time. Scots can also take part in some non-contact sports including golf, angling and outdoor swimming. Garden centres, drive-through restaurants and recycling centres will also be reopened. The First Minister announced that teachers would be allowed to re-enter schools to prepare for the proposedof schools on August . People will also now be allowed to sit and sunbathe in local parks. A legal limit will not be put on how far people will be allowed to travel for recreation but the First Minister said the strong advice of the Scottish Government was to stay within five miles. She added: We simply donapost want, in this phase, large numbers of people at tourist hotspots or beauty spots. Crowds of people, eventheyaposre trying to social distance, bring more risk than we judge is acceptable at this point. The First Minister asked that the number of people together between the two households should not exceed a maximum of eight people, along with asking that meetings do not take place with a dferent household in the same day. She said: I know how much all of you, all of us, will be looking forward to seeing family and friends for the first time in a while, but how we do this will be vital. Before you meet up with people from another household, you should stop, think, read the guidance and make sure youaposre protecting yourself and others.  In particular, you must stay outdoors and stay two metres away from people from the other household - that is crucial. The First Minister told those who had been asked to shield for  weeks due to an underlying health condition that they have not been forgotten, adding that measures were being drawn up to move to less of a blanket approach that reflects the circumstances of the inidual. Ms Sturgeon said her confidence in the move to phase one was boosted by the initiation of the Test and Protect scheme in Scotland, which is aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. Under the scheme, those who are symptomatic will be tested and their contacts traced should they have the virus.  The First Minister also said people will be able to help to stop the spread of the virus by continuing to social distance. She added: Test and Protect will be a crucial part of our efforts to control this virus in the weeks ahead, but it will not do it on its own. The use of face coverings, social distancing and hand washing, the First Minister said, will remain key to tackling the spread of the virus.Ms Sturgeon said that a downward trend in coronavirus cases was sustained and unmistakable."},{"url":null,"title":"three month old baby girl","story":"NewsThree-month-old baby girl found dead as woman, , arrested on suspicion of murderHampshire Police have released a woman under investigation after they were called to a flat in Gosport where they found a seriously unwell baby girl who died before she could be taken to hospitalShareByMilo Boyd:,  MAY NewsA baby girl died on March  in Gosport, Hampshire\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And despite the heat-wave set to continue for now, BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes said there are warning signs that things may be ready to change.Yesterday saw highs of C in the Heathrow area and while Mr Fawkes said Thursday will be warmer in the northwest the sunny weather will not reach everyone.He said overnight two concerning weather fronts were moving in which could dictate the weather in Britain in the coming days.  One coming down the North Sea, a cold front, thataposs going to be introducing cooler air to East Anglia and south east England, dropping temperatures, he said. While another in northern Scotland, is set to bring cloudy weather and outbreaks of rain today. The heaviest of this across the Highlands, into Aberdeenshire, Orkney and Shetland as well, he added.  Mr Fawkes said while the likes of Manchester will see C and Glasgow , itaposs going to feel fresher in London which dips to  degrees. Overnight temperatures into Thursday plummeted C in Norwich compared to the previous day, as that cooler air works in.

The country has seen , more deaths than usual since March , three days before the lockdown was announced. This means the virus has directly or indirectly killed  people per million, analysis by the Financial Times suggests. That is a higher death rate than any other country providing detailed data, including Italy and the US. Italy was the European country hardest hit by the virus in the early stages of the crisis, although the UK and US have subsequently recorded more excess deaths. Despite the US suffering more than , deaths, the highest number of fatalities in the world, its excess death rate is still lower than the UK as it has a population of  million. The data used by the Financial Times was from national statistical organisations in  countries, including all European countries hard hit by coronavirus. These were the only countries for which enough information could be found to make proper comparisons. The actual number of excess deaths in the UK is the highest in Europe, with only the US recording more globally. Peru is the only country that has recorded a higher percentage increase in deaths than the UK since the pandemic started. While countries like China and Russia have suffered many fatalities, the overall death rate is much lower than the UK because of their large populations.

It was deeply insulting. There was no apology for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings. There was no acknowledgement of the anger it caused and no acceptance that it had undermined the Government’s message at a crucial moment in the battle against coronavirus. Calls for an inquiry were swatted away with the arrogance of an oligarch bored of counting his money. The Prime Minister repeatedly claimed the allegations against Cummings were . When asked to substantiate this allegation he declined. Yet as this paper has accurately reported, Cummings did flout the lockdown restrictions, the police did speak to his family and he did make a trip, against the clear instructions, to Barnard Castle. When this defence failed, Mr Johnson resorted to the cheapest trick in the book by accusing anyone asking perfectly legitimate questions of playing party politics. Nobody is playing a game here. There is genuine concern that the public will lose faith in the lockdown measures which could result in a second spike and yet more deaths. On Thursday the Government will roll out its test and trace programme that will require hundreds of thousands of people to self-isolate for  days, whether they are infected or not. Mr Johnson was hesitant to say whether this was compulsory or not – it will, in fact, be voluntary – because he knows he can no longer tell the public what to do when his chief adviser is making the rules up as he goes along.

One of the officers at the scene, Detective Rick Scully, has vivid memories of the dayaposs tragedy.  He said: It was like being in the Twilight Zone. We were wandering from room to room to room, and every room we went into we were finding bodies. Youaposre thinking aposwhen is this going to end  How many bodies are going to be in here  How many rooms are there to this place apos Because every room we went in had bodies stacked up like cordwood. Applewhite had started his career in the Armed Forces before going on the teach music at several universities. But following the death of his father in , he fell into a deep depression and left his teaching post. The following year, Applewhite met nurse Bonnie Nettles and the two formed an incredibly close friendship, where they would discuss mysticism. They decided they were aposine mesengersapos and opened a book shop and teaching centre to spead their message before taking what they viewed as their mission on a tour of the US. It was on Applewhite and Nettles travels that he was arrested and jailed for failing toa hire car on time - and he used his time behind bars to develop his theology. When he was released the pair headed to Calornia, where they recruited a commited group of followers to their cause. Their message was extreme - anyone who joined his cult would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed. Over the years this morphed into a belief that the human body was simply a container for the soul, and this would be placed in a new body when they reached the spaceship. As the cult grew, so did its ability to make money and they put down roots. But then, in , Applewhite was dealt a devastating blow when Nettles died from cancer. He told his followers that she had transcended to the aposnext levelapos because she had too much energy to remain on earth. It was after Nettlesapos death that Applewhite really tightened his grip on the cult and he encouraged its members to view him as a Christ-like figure. Throughout the s Heavenaposs Gate started to focus on the suppression of sexual desire with Applewhite and seven of his following even going to the extreme s of surgically castrating themselves. He claimed aposnext levelapos beings had no sexual organs and also forced all the members to wear matching, gender neutral, clothes and to have the same haircuts.By the s, Heavenaposs Gate were living in their mansion in Santa Fe and wanted to get their message out to a wider audience.They recorded to videos appealing for people to joiin them for the last chance to evacuate earth. When Applewhite heard the comet Hale-Bop was approaching the planet, he convinced his followers that Nettles was on board a ship hiding behind it and this was her sign that she wanted he and the rest of his cult to join her.  But the only way they could do this was to commit suicide and leave their aposvesselsapos behind.In March , the group completely cut themselves off from the world and recorded their farewell messages. Applewhite also planned to kill himself because he had said that the group would ascend during his letime, so appointing a successor was unfeasible.Wearing their matching unorms, the cult took barbituates, in some cases in apple sauce, and drank alcohol - and slowly, over the next three days, they all died.

However all staff are doing their best to ensure they have the appropriate PPE provided and wear it appropriately to minimise risk to our own and others safety.#I have always felt proud to be a paramedic and work for the Scottish ambulance service, and now more so than ever. It has been overwhelming to see the appreciation and gratitude from everyone through messages of support and donations. It is a reminder how rewarding and valuable the role is.#Meanwhile, Scott spoke of the impact the outbreak has had and said: #My work itself has not changed however the conditions of such work have in relation to protecting ourselves by using PPE and our contact with patients.#Patients are more fearful for themselves and us as key workers. We are still a frontline emergency service who respond to calls and treat patients in the best way we can, it’s just the logistics that are slightly dferent.#And he spoke of what it is like responding to calls during lockdown, saying: #It is strange being out and about during lock down.

I feel proud to be part of the ambulance service although scary at the moment with the unknown. It’s still a very rewarding job and even more so now. The support from the public has been outstanding. I was quite emotional the first time I heard the Thursday pm clap from all the surrounding streets.#Not being able to see family and friends has been dficult but I think we are lucky that we have the technology so I’m able to keep in touch with people over facetime etc. The fact that shops have opened especially for NHS workers has helped with weekly shops etc.#Getting finished I’m straight into the shower before leaving work, as there is the worry that I could take this virus home to my family. Once home, it’s catching up with family and finding out how their day has gone with home schooling etc and getting something to eat. If I’m nights I’m straight home to bed.#John spoke of the challenges presented by social distancing, and said: #Practising social distancing has been challenging but like a lot of things, it is not about being perfect but about doing your best in the situation you find yourself in.#If we have the space to do so then we of course distance ourselves from each other and the public but there are occasionally tight squeeze situations that we find ourselves in. Nevertheless, we always wear the correct PPE to keep ourselves and others safe at all times.#He also spoke of the pride he has in his job: #I feel an immense sense of pride and responsibility working as an ambulance technician during the pandemic.

All four isions will look at the plans.Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack recently claimed he was “supportive in principle” of Budge’s scenario given it is for temporary reconstruction.As there would need to be a change to the prize money distribution model under Budge’s proposal, top-flight clubs would have to vote - in favour.The  lower league clubs would have to vote % in favour.

It is so unfair and I would say that for any club sitting at the bottom of the table – even with one or two games to go, never mind with eight or nine games to go.“It was still well within Hearts’ control and the hand they have been dealt by being effectively relegated as things stand was so harsh.”Budge’s plan would also prevent Partick Thistle being relegated.However, the Hearts owner’s proposal would see League One sides Clyde , Peterhead , Forfarand Stranraerin the new bottom tier.League Two champions Cove Rangers would also be denied promotion.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

inAugust.The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful

If it expired before Monday, March , youll need to book an MOT as usual and shouldnt drive until youre taking your car for the test. Although test centres and garages have been allowed to stay open so you can do this, the Government says that at present you should only get your MOT doneyou need your car to be able to shop for bare necessities, for medical reasons or for work .Tyres:If youve not beenkeeping them inflated to the correct pressurewhile youve been off the road, check the pressure and inflate accordingly before you head out.Vehicle tax:Check your car is taxed oryou could face a fine of up to pound,.

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed.

No change there then because they were overlooked before coronavirus theyrsquove always been overlooked. Irsquom talking about young men, especially young men from deprived backgrounds. Theyrsquore powerless and weak in Scotland and they feel it. But coronavirus doesnrsquot care. Itrsquos a bully: it goes for the powerless and the weak.Irsquom not talking here, obviously, about the direct effects of coronavirus ndash young people are more likely to survive Covid ndash Irsquom talking about the ancillary effects: lockdown, the economic damage, the closure of schools. All of these factors will have a disproportionately negative effect on young men. So could we start paying attention please First: lockdown. Itrsquos grim, itrsquos lonely, and we know young people are more likely to feel depressed about it than older age groups. We also know men are less good at dealing with the consequences for their mental health and more prone to coping with drugs, alcohol or even suicide. Irsquove seen the young men among my friends and family struggle. Itrsquos probably one of the reasons theyrsquove been way more likely than young women to break the lockdown rules.Second: the economic damage. Wersquore in the middle of a crisis in which government policy is depressing the economy and we know from the  financial crisis that itrsquos young people that bear the brunt  years ago, youth unemployment rose by % in some countries. Women may be clustered in low-paid jobs, but the unemployment rate is higher for men and it gets higher the younger you are.And third: education. Young men have been falling behind women in educational attainment for years and the locked gates of schools and colleges is going to make that worse and mostly itrsquos going to make it worse for men from deprived backgrounds. For a lot of young guys, school is the only chance they have anditrsquos shut, their chance shuts down with it, and then they leave school and there are no jobs because of coronavirus, and then theyrsquore more likely to get depressed or resort to drugs or crime. You can see the spiral, canrsquot you Part of the answer is to get in early and give men the skills they need to cope when le gets dficult the other part of the answer is to treat them much better when they get into trouble and canrsquot cope. The alternative, especially under lockdown, is to see boys struggle at school, then struggle to get a job, then struggle with drugs and depression, and then, for some, end up in prison or a mortuary.I once spoke about this to the former Scottish prisons inspector Brigadier Hugh Munro and his take on it was that we need to focus on the lives of young men long before they start to struggle. Boys, he said, are often forced to fit into an academic structure thatrsquos not right for them and they rebel or drop out. Encourage their skills in other areas insteadand you can prevent them getting into trouble.But I was also interested in what the brigadier had to say about young men who do end up in trouble because wersquore still getting that wrong in Scotland. Young men who struggle at school are more likely to leave without qualications andyou donrsquot have qualications yoursquore more likely to get into trouble and end up in prison, and prison, really, is the last chance to turn things around. But no: it just gets worse.Imagine, for example, you end up in Barlinnie. The chances are when you arrive there, yoursquoll be held in one of the tiny holding cells that were condemned last century as a breach of the law on human rights . It is also unlikely that yoursquoll get to access the education or rehabilitation or therapy you need. Fat chance: yoursquore banged up, then kicked out.Itrsquos mostly young men who end up this way and lockdown makes it even more likely by undermining the services that can help, like education or a decent job. As Hugh Munro points out, wersquore imprisoning too many young men when a community alternative would be better. But wersquore still failing them in other ways too. And the bully of coronavirus, and the lockdown thatrsquos supposed to beat it, is making it worse.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Wersquove been erted from the highest moral purpose ndash keeping our minds fixed on the loss of fellow human beings and the government decisions which were involved in their deaths ndash to casting our eyes into a gutter of deceit, hypocrisy and selfishness.This is not to say, however, that the media should have held back on coverage of Cummings ndash completely the reverse. Without the forensic scrutiny of journalists wersquod never know about the double standards to which the rich and powerful hold themselves and us. We can now see that the Cummings scandal isnrsquot just a moral affront, itrsquos potentially lethal too. How many people have shrugged their shoulders and said to hell with public health advice in the wake of Cummingsrsquo actions, adopting a lsquo he can do it, so can Irsquo attitude However, under the cover of such an appalling spectacle many political issues have become distorted at a time when we need clarity of vision and nowhere has that distortion played out more than in Scotland. Cummings has had a unique Caledonian Effect.Letrsquos be frank, the squalid behaviour of Cummings and Johnson has thrown a protective cloak around the the SNP government when it comes to failures over coronavirus. Cummings has unwittingly played something of a blinder for the party and its ambitions for independence.Until the Cummings scandal, most decent minds were concentrated on the SNP governmentrsquos dreadful handling of care home deaths. More than  elderly hospital patients were sent to homes prior to mandatory testing. Around half of Scotlandrsquos deaths have been in care homes.Amid the Cummings scandal, Nicola Sturgeon said she found the care home deaths ldquoheartbreaking. Shersquos a woman of decency so her emotional response is to be believed. That doesnrsquot excuse her Governmentrsquos failures, however. Yet with Cummings soaking up headlines, scrutiny of the issue shrunk. Pressure on health secretary Jeane Freeman over her mistakes weakened.We cannot simply accept such failings in Holyrood because therersquos a tawdry circus of shame in Westminster that draws attention away. You didnrsquot need a science degree to know that the elderly were most at risk. However, there was no mandatory testing for all new care home residents in Scotland until April .The Cummings scandal has overshadowed claims that the transfer of elderly patients from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow to Gartnavel led to the virus spreading like it was onboard a ldquocruise ship. Gartnavel is said to have recorded  cases and  deaths in a matter of weeks. The buck for this stops at the desk of the health secretary and the First Minister.Concerns about a possible cover-up by the Scottish Government over an early outbreak of coronavirus in Edinburgh have been eclipsed by the Cummings scandal. Lockdown came too late here ndash just as it did in England. Testing and tracing have been inadequate. Itrsquos been a catalogue of one failure after another.From the pandemicrsquos early days, there wasnrsquot that much of a substantive dference in policy between Holyrood and Westminster. Increasingly, though, Sturgeon has begun to forge Scotlandrsquos own path but itrsquos still far from successful. We arenrsquot New Zealand, thatrsquos for sure.Set against the Johnson government, anything would look good. Some % of Scots think Sturgeon has handled the crisis well. However, comparing pretty bad to bloody useless shouldnrsquot be the yardstick by which we measure what our governments do for us.The SNP are frankly lucky to have this shameless and idiotic government in London in the shape of Cummings and Johnson. But that, sadly, makes the Scottish people less lucky. The failings in Scotland arenrsquot any less meaningful just because Boris Johnson is a disaster. If Westminster was being run by a competent leader, the SNPrsquos behaviour would seem signicantly more concerning.The Cummings Effect is also shaping other parties. Some Scottish Tories finally distanced themselves from the UK leadership, with calls for Cummings to go. It simply adds to the notion that the Scottish Tories should strike out alone and leave the UK fold. It also reinforces the perception that the partyrsquos voice here is relatively meaningless.What have Scottish Labour or the Scottish LibDems done that matters throughout the Cummings scandal  Nothing. Whatrsquos the point of Scottish Labour  When it comes to Labour the only story in town is Keir Starmer ndash the great hope. Nice guy as he may be, Richard Leonard doesnrsquot cut through ndash even at a time like this, with Cummings, when a butter kne could cut throughit had the will. The Greens also need to find their voice.When it comes to independence, Cummings must have an effect on floating voters, and soft No voters. Irsquom a Yes voter, and Irsquove been increasingly disheartened in the direction of travel the independence movement has taken in recent years. The SNP base is beyond ugly, the idea of independence has intellectually stagnated, and independence itself has provided the SNP with a shield to hide bad governance behind as its voters will tolerate any failing as long as talk of independence is thrown out now and again as red meat.But even jaded Yes voters like me feel a little galvanised now by the Cummings scandal. I may be uneasy with the independence package currently on offer ndash too many unanswered questions, and the whf of populism, Scottish exceptionalism and thin-skinned nationalism ndash but compared to where Westminster is going, I know which option looks more appealing. Westminster has been a corrupt failure for generations, now itrsquos a sick, cruel joke played on the British people.This pandemic hasnrsquot been handled well or adequately by Scotland and its government. Nevertheless, even a dysal Scotland is better than whatever the hell is happening in Westminster.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Many weeks spent at home may have highlighted the dficulties of current properties for some people, who are now looking to move on.\"As the shutdown continues, concerns have been raised over sellers whose home reports have been due to expire during the Covid- lockdown.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said it is vital that home reports provide accurate information.He added: \"If a property was placed on the market before the lockdown period and has not been withdrawn from the market for a period exceeding four weeks, the home report will remain valid until the property is sold.\"The Scottish Government is actively considering how it can best support the housing market when current movement restrictions are relaxed, and whether any additional measures are required to facilitate transactions, in liaison with industry and other stakeholders.\"The construction industry, which is still on pause by the Scottish Government, will also be key in re-starting the housing market.At First Ministers Questions yesterday, Conservative MSP Graham Simpson, asked Nicola Sturgeon when house-building will be re-started.He said: \"At the moment, we have , homes in Scotland that are nearly completed. The construction sector is waiting to start rebuilding those homes, but it does not yet know when it can do so.\"I have been contacted by customers, who are the important people, across the country, who are waiting to get into their homes, including one man, who was written to by the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning and advised to contact the housing charity, Shelter.ldquoAll that people want to know is when builders can start working again. What is the answer to that question Ms Sturgeon stressed that ldquothe priority is to keep people as safe as possible from the coronavirus outbreak.She added: ldquoIf and when we move into it, phase one will allow the construction sector to implement the first two stages of its own re-start programme, which is a programme that has been developed through collaboration between government and the industry.ldquoWe will give as much clarity about all that as we can, step by step, but we will not ndash we must not ndash take our eye off the priority of keeping the virus suppressed and not allowing it to get out of control again.Analysis by Rightmove in the first week that the housing market in England re-opened found that demand for rental property was up by  per cent compared to the previous year ndash with Monday  May seeing the highest level of rental demand ever recorded in one day on the website.For those looking to buy a property, Rightmove had almost , new sales listings on the market in the first week of the sector re-opening in England ndash % down on the same week last year but improving from a % fall during lockdown."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-second-attractive-place-invest-uk-seventh-year---survey","story":"EYs Scotland Attractiveness Survey shows that both in terms of attracting foreign direct investmentand attracting a number of UK projects, Scotland is in a strong position.The report surveyed  international investments, and for the seventh year running, Scotland was the most attractive place for companies to invest outside of London.The report showed that there had been a .% increase in the number of projects secured, from  in  to  in .:Scottish beauty spot revealed as UKs most romantic placeGrowth in Scottish investment was also at a faster pace than the rest of the UK, with a .% increase .Ally Scott, UKI managing partner for EY Scotland, said: \"Scotland has yet again achieved an impressive performance on FDI in .

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full. Exceptionally, requests for a loan period of up to  years may be considered.Businesses can find guidance and check the criteria for funding here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-Loan-Guide and,eligible, apply online here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-LoanThose that are unsure about their eligibility should contact the Council’s economic development team for advice at economic.development@orkney.gov.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We remain committed to supporting the work of the management group to co-ordinate a range of goose management measures as soon as feasibly possible.”Alan Corrigall, Orkney NFU Scotland chairman said: “We are disappointed that the momentum which had been gathering to find new ways to control the resident geese population has come to a halt.  However, hopefully marksmen shooting later this summer can still go ahead as planned, and the other agreed control measures can be trialled next year.”Land managers can still control greylag geese under the General Licence to prevent agricultural damage, provided they can comply with the Government’s COVID- restriction rules. The General Licence was amended this year so inidual licences to carry out shooting or egg oiling during closed season are no longer required.Greylag goose meat sales have also been consented under a General Licence for Orkney. As a result, land managers on Orkney can now, under food hygiene legislation, sell the greylag goose carcasses they generate,they are satisfied they comply with the COVID- suppression rules. Land managers must ensure work carried out follows the General Licence rules.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

Hatston will be open from .am to .pm and Garson from .am to .am. Both will be closed between .pm and .pm.Andrew Drever, vice-chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We thank folk for their patience while our sites were closed, as we waited for national advice on essential travel in Scotland to change.“I hope people will welcome the step-by-step approach we are taking to opening the sites again and understand the need for them to operate dferently to the way they did before the pandemic.“This is to ensure the safety of our staff and visitors to the sites. Limiting the number of cars and visitors on site at any particular time will enable social and physical distancing. We would urge those visiting to stay at least two metres away from staff and from other visitors on site.”Councillor Drever said: “Both sites are likely to be very busy for the first few days. To avoid the risk of waiting in long queues, we would ask folk to use them onlyit is absolutely necessary.“As a way to spread visits across the week, we are suggesting that you make your visit –possible – on your normal bin collection day. If your bin collection day is a Mondaywe’d suggest that you visit on a Saturday instead.”He added: “As summer approaches we know that many folk will be keen to dispose of waste from their gardens.“That’s why we are concentrating on this when the sites re-open as part of the phased approach we are taking. For the time being, no other materials can be disposed of at Hatston or Garson.”This will be kept under review and, when possible, the sites will start to take other materials as well.Decisions on opening the other HWRCs – and recycling points in the isles – will be taken at a later date as part of the phased approach the council is taking.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The guidance stresses the need for personal responsibility when travelling and this co-operation is vital as we work to provide a safe transport system that supports the people of Scotland.“The route map offers a path away from the current restrictions, but the virus is still with us,we move too quickly or without appropriate diligence, it could rapidly run out of control again. “The level of physical distancing required as we navigate the phases of the route map will affect the available capacity of public transport. Operators estimate capacity will be between  per cent and  per cent of normal availability even with full services resumed. “A system that previously had . million journeys per day will be signicantly constrained. So today, I am urging employers, operators and the public to embrace these changes and help us all adapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core, for the immediate future at least, flattens peak travel demand and has a strong focus on active travel.“We are looking to increase the frequency of public transport. But reducing the demand for transport is vitally important. We are urging employers to show leadership and be as flexible as possible to allow earlier or later starting and finishing times for those that have to travel to work.  “Over the coming weeks and working with our local authority partners, the transport transition plan will look to manage demand and increase availability of road space and priority for walking, cycling, wheeling and bus. “We have a real opportunity to secure a positive and lasting change, one which supports sustainable travel habits. I am therefore delighted to confirm that the ‘Spaces for People’ fund for local authorities has proven so popular that it is being increased to £ million.“We all have a personal responsibility to take steps to protect ourselves and others. It is vital that we continue to keep two metres physical distance wherever possible, wash hands regularly and maintain good cough hygiene.  “Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be dficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff. For that reason, people should, and are expected to, wear face coverings as an additional measure when using public transport and as a consideration to staff and fellow passengers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!! As for the complex causes of obesity, it is really simple Peter, it is not even class-related. It is simply eating more than food than your body needs. Whatever socio-psychological hogwash you may spout, in the final analysis, comes down to eating too much. It is that simple..."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK. It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Whatever is implemented will put the wellbeing of our children at its heart.”Schools closed on th March and since then pupils have been learning at home, through lessons delivered online by teachers.Other pledges made by Mr Swinney included one to expand the school estate, using libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference venues or taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to increase the time children can spend with their teachers.He also suggested that retired teachers couldto school as part of plans to limit class sizes.To support digital home learning, the Scottish Government is to invest £ million for , laptops or tablets – with internet access provided – for disadvantaged childrenMr Swinney added “This is not, however, ato schooling as we knew it # schools are not ing to normal at this stage.“To keep our pupils and staff safe we will implement physical distancing, staggered arrival and departure times, staggered break times, increased hand hygiene, enhanced cleaning regimes and a range of other measures.“That means a new model of teaching, learning and support will have to be delivered.

It is so important that we support our local farmers and producers.“Ballymena Weekly Market has been operating in the town for many years and its origins date back to the s, when King Charles I stipulated a Saturday market under the terms of the sale of the land that Ballymena is built on.“The reopening of the markets will help provide a safe shopping experience and support the local economy as we move through the first tentative steps towards the easing of lockdown restrictions.”Alderman Billy Ashe MBE added: “This is a welcome development as I know many local people have been missing being able to go the markets during recent weeks and months.“I must congratulate the traders and council staff for working together to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to protect the safety of those using the markets in the borough.”Cllr Gregg McKeen said: “This is an important step in supporting our local economy during a dficult and uncertain time for all sectors.“With the correct social distancing and public health rules in place, the reopening of our outdoor weekly markets will be done safely and to the benefit of our borough.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3134145.jpg--.jpg?1590072730000\n","title":"wrightbus announces redundancies as it looks to secure its future","story":"Bus manufacturer Wrightbus has today announced a number of redundancies at its factory in Ballymena as it looks to create a stable and secure future for the company in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Chief Executive Buta Atwal said the tough decision has been taken to make up to  permanent employees redundant pending consultation, as well as a reduction in agency staff of up to  workers over a phased period that will be kept under review. The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

There will be thousands of job losses, he said.I#ll be proposing that a task force is set up to focus on how best we get the city back up and running. I#d like to see a memorial built to all those who have lost their lives from Covid-.In an exclusive interview with the Belfast , the next Lord Mayor talked about being the first single dad in the job.The SDLP is set to nominate its poll-topping Ardoyne councillor, Paul McCusker, as Deputy Lord Mayor. A nurse in the Mater Hospital, he is a community activist known for his work with the homeless.Covid- will make Monday#s mayoral installation ceremony very dferent from those in previous years. Social distancing means there can#t be a full meeting of all  councillors. Instead, each party will nominate a small number of representatives to attend.The practice of the outgoing Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor placing the chain of office around the shoulders of their successors will be suspended.Mr McCoubrey succeeds Sinn Fein#s Danny Baker and Mr McCusker takes over from Alliance#s Peter McReynolds.The next Lord Mayor hopes that, despite the restrictions, his mother and five children can watch proceedings from the public gallery in City Hall.Mr McCoubrey will also not have the crowded diary of public engagements that usually awaits new Lord Mayors. It#s very frustrating, he said. Once restrictions ease, I want to be out thanking our NHS and care workers, and those who have been delivering food parcels to the old and vulnerable.Mr McCoubrey, who has been a councillor for  years, said his working-class roots would be to the fore during his mayoralty.I grew up in Springmartin and I still live there. We had nothing. We were no dferent from the people in Springhill across the peace line. I#m a proud unionist but I want to be a Lord Mayor for the people of Springmartin, Springhill and all in this city, whatever their politics.Asked about his attitude to gay marriage, which his party opposes, he said: Same-sex marriage is legal here, and I#ve always taken the approach of live and let live. As Lord Mayor I want everyone to feel welcome in this city regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Mr McCoubrey was first elected as a councillor for the Ulster Democratic Party , the UDA#s political wing. He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

But yesterday, as a news reporter was delivering an update on the story about Cummings# alleged breaching of lockdown rules, Ms McKeever#s voice cut in saying: I was thinking he was such a d*** - I had written his name as Richard Cummings...

This has been an unprecedented time when faithful Catholics have been unable to receive the Eucharist for months.While many churches have been availing of streaming services via webcams and social media over recent weeks, it#s not the same as being present for Mass.I have a lot of anxious parents whose children haven#t yet been baptised so as soon as it is safe we should be doing that.Fr McCafferty added: Clergy will adapt to the current danger and make things as safe as possible. Older people may be disappointed at not being able toimmediately but we have to consider their safety. The draft plan also envisages confirmation ceremonies taking place in mid-September but advises that such celebrations would be conducted by the parish priest and may have to take place in small groups over successive days.The plan aims to ensure that all preparations are made so that churches are ready to move once the civil authorities in both Northern Ireland and the Republic give approval.Government sources in Dublin have hinted that phase four of its roadmap - when public Masses are due to begin from July  - could be brought forward to the end of Junethe virus continues to be successfully managed.The -point programme, which is expected to be boiled down to key issues in the coming days, also bans choirs and congregational singing when churches re-open.It suggested that dioceses prepare short videos similar to aircraft safety demonstrations to assist parishioners in correct behaviour when ing to Mass.The document says: It is clear that re-opening the pastoral le of the Church will be far more challenging institutionally than anything we have been through in the past few months. Our biggest challenge may be lack of motivation to do all that is required on the part of some, and unbridled enthusiasm to do everything on the part of others.It needs to be clearly understood, however, that churches will only be able to re-open for public liturgy when the proper procedures have been put in place.Earlier this week, Archbishop Eamon Martin said it was sad and disappointing that the Covid- restrictions have lasted throughout the Easter season and congregations are still unable to gather physically.Belfast Most ReadNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Infrastructure Minister Mallon calls for Cummings to resign after two Covid- deaths reportedBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffeWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyMcDonald#s to re-open Northern Ireland drive-thru restaurants,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

It#s a  Mustang, and Ireland and Ulster winger Jacob Stockdale couldn#t be happier working on his classic car, with its blue bodywork and two go-faster stripes down its back.The -year-old professional rugby player bought the car on eBay a year ago and the last two months of lockdown in Belfast has given him the luxury of time to pull on his mechanic#s overalls and explore the iconic #first gen# Mustang.Jacob won#t reveal how much he paid for the car which came off the Ford assembly line two years after the first Mustang debuted.It probably was not one of my wisest purchases, but I bought it as a bit of a project car, something to do a bit of work to as a hobby and I love it, said the Lurgan native.Going into lockdown has given me time to tinker away on the car, and I#ve done quite a bit of work on it. I#ve replaced the entire suspension.I re-wired a few things like the horn and the radio because they were both draining the battery.And a year after arriving in Belfast from London, the car still hasn#t a name.No, funnily enough I haven#t given it a name. Nothing comes to mind yet, said Jacob.In terms of its shape, it is my favourite style of Mustang. They ran from  to # or #, so I wanted one from that range.The engine is . litres, so it#s hardly a green machine. It#s quite thirsty, put it that way, said Jacob.And what about speed  Jacob Stockdale is certainly no slouch on the field of play.The GPS which players wear on the back of their jerseys records their speed, travel distance and other stats.I think the fastest I#ve ever been clocked moving is . metres per second, which is around  miles per hour or something like that, said Jacob.He name checks the Mustang Fastbacks, famous for their speed, but Jacob is self-deprecating about his motor. I would say mine is more loud and slow.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carAnd while he loves the loud sound of the Mustang, his Hungarian Vizsla dog, Layla, isn#t so keen.Purist tendencies means Jacob tries to keep the car looking like it did when it came out of the factory and while his new radio looks old, it has Bluetooth. Just the thing to listen to Johnny Cash, one of his musical favourites, in the car Not so, it seems. He prefers to listen to the sound of the car.

I wanted to take the pressure off them and do something for the whole denomination, providing some normality perhaps, he said.Uppermost in my mind also was the sense of identity, of being a Presbyterian family who could not meet together. I wanted to give expression to that in the midst of everything.He added: We have all been affected by the pandemic, and my heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones across our island and those who have battled against the virus. They have been in my thoughts and prayers, just as those who continue to go that extra mile in providing daily care for them in our hospitals and care homes. It has been incredible and as a church we thank God for their selfless service and sacrice.The Rev Henry last preached to a church congregation on March . I have been askedI feel that I have been #locked-out# because of the Covid- emergency, he said.We have all had to make adjustments and to live with changed times. As a Moderator your diary is full, you know exactly what you are doing and then suddenly  weeks or more are wiped. However just as in the months before the lockdown, I have been busy and in some ways even busier, but in a dferent way. I have done  weekly pre-recorded services, with the last one going out on Sunday.He admitted that his year in the post had pushed me out of my comfort zone. I am naturally quite shy and reserved and that is not who a Moderator is. You have to get out there, speak up and do the things you are called to do, he said.He said that since the lockdown the Irish church leaders have met more frequently, through video-conferencing, nearly every two weeks. He has already taken part in online meetings with the First and Deputy First Ministers, UK church leaders and the Taioseach. The Moderator#s outgoing address will be streamed live on Monday night during the installation service for the new Moderator, Rev David Bruce.Belfast Most ReadNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Infrastructure Minister Mallon calls for Cummings to resign after two Covid- deaths reportedBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffeWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyMcDonald#s to re-open Northern Ireland drive-thru restaurants,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The former Ballinderry Chairman is Ulster GAAs Head of Operations, but has been called onto the GAAs Covid- Advisory Group, chaired by Chairman of Health and Safety group Shay Bannon. “Our work is less than two weeks old,” McGeehan told the County Derry Post, of the group that reports directly to President John Horan and Director General Tom Ryan. “We are there to provide advice and make recommendations. In terms of the decisions, they will be made by the GAAs management committee. googletag.cmd.push “Our remit is a short and sharp piece of work to develop protocols of how and on what basis,it is possible, will it be possible toto training, playing and eventually watching games again.” Professor Mary Horgan, a professor in infectious diseases, has been added to the group. She has previously been advising other world governing bodies of sport. “Her role is crucial in helping voluntary bodies like the GAA,” McGeehan feels. “All of this needs to be medically driven, whether is it is public health advice from the governments or the research around the vaccines and all that might be required in the future.” googletag.cmd.push The committee have, as McGeehan terms it, the easy job, with GAA management having the final call. An initial plan of inter-county action in October and club pencilled in for mid-July, was based on a cut back version. Footballs Tier  championship, the Super s and the qualiers were likely to be shelved, as were the group stages in the hurling championship. In terms of Derry, the senior hurlers had qualied for the NHL promotion play-off. It was initially hoped that games involving relegation and promotion couldve been pencilled into the overall plan, in a bid to provide a clean slate for . “There is no play-book to this and I dont think anyone knowsany of the league games could be played,” was McGeehans opinion on the situation. “At the minute, the focus is on whether activity willat all and what it would require to bring that activity back. No formal decision has been made on the league or the championship.” He also has sympathy for Antrim and Armagh footballers who worked themselves into promising league positions. “That decision will be taken very carefully and on the basis of what space there is. As the weeks go on, I think it becomes less likely that there will be room for them, but I wouldnt rule them out completely.” In terms of club activity, counties have been working away to come up with plans that could be activated once there is a green light. It is likely that club leagues will be scrapped with,there is any action, a series of warm-up games ahead of a knock-out championship. “It would be very important for a lead-in period,” McGeehan feels. “You would want to give club players time to get collective training under their belt, to get them out. Given the timescale, there mightnt be room for many league games. “The window is a moving piste, in that the GAA talked about October and November . In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must. IDEAL “An ideal situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so. From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change. In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues. There are issues over social isolation. I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary. We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school. He asks: “Is there a way, after risk assessments, that you are able to get juvenile activity moving and you are able to get kids out on the pitch again ” “If that is an area of less-risk for the spread of the disease and children have been less affected by it, that presents an opportunity to get them out whenever there is the science to be able to do that.” From the point of view of testing, McGeehan – while pointing out that inter-county players are deemed elite – the GAA is dferent to the Premier League, or indeed the Bundesliga that has two rounds complete since their resumption. “We are dferent,” he begins. “We are neither professional nor semi-professional. From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job.

They are amateurs, they have a days work and they have families.” GAA Covid- Advisory Group Shay Bannon- existing Chairman of Health and Safety groupDick Clerkin Dr Pat O’Neill Dr Kevin Moran Dr Jim O’Donovan Dr Seaacuten Moffatt Paul Flynn Stephen McGeehan Tony McGuinness Sineacutead McNulty Helen O’Rourke Professor Mary Horgan John Horan Tom Ryan Feargal McGill  RELATED - Sport NI announce new plans forto activity .In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must.IDEAL“An idea situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so.From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change.In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues.There are issues over social isolation.I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary.We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school. He asks: “Is there a way, after risk assessments, that you are able to get juvenile activity moving and you are able to get kids out on the pitch again ” “If that is an area of less-risk for the spread of the disease and children have been less affectedby it, that presents an opportunity to get them out whenever there is the science to be able to do that.” From the point of view of testing, McGeehan – while pointing out that inter-county players are deemed elite – the GAA is dferent to the Premier League, or indeed the Bundesliga that has two rounds complete since their resumption. “We are dferent,” he begins.“We are neither professional nor semi-professional.From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job.They are amateurs, they have a days work and they have families.” *** BOX OFF AND INCLUDE – IF A FILLER IS NEEDED ***GAA Covid- Advisory Group Shay Bannon- existing Chairman of Health and Safety group Dick ClerkinDr Pat O’NeillDr Kevin MoranDr Jim O’DonovanDr Seaacuten MoffattPaul FlynnStephen McGeehanTony McGuinnessSineacutead McNultyHelen O’RourkeProfessor Mary HorganJohn HoranTom RyanFeargal McGill \"More...

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill announced that the Magee Medical School had been agreed and that students would start next September. Days later Economy Minister Diane Dodds said signicant work is required and questioned Ulster Universitys financial stability. She added that further reports would be submitted to the Executive. Seeking clarity on the matter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “I have today submitted a written question asking health minister Robin Swannhe will publish his department’s own internal business case for the Magee Medical School. We need greater transparency. googletag.cmd.push “While I very strongly welcome the progress made recently with regard to the Magee Medical School, we also have to impose sunlight on the process to learn where the blockages are. It is very important that we keep the pressure on to ensure the Magee Medical School opens in September . “I emphasised this in my speech in the Northern Ireland Assembly this evening, in which I complained about the lack of transparency over the progress on the Medical School and compared this to the confusion over the plans for Northern Ireland after the end of the Brexit transition period.” In part of that speech, she said: “I met – virtually of course – yesterday with senior representatives of Ulster University. I left the meeting with the sense that they were as in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the Medical School as we in Northern Ireland are about the new customs arrangements after Brexit. googletag.cmd.push “We need to know what is going on. We need greater transparency. That applies to the British government’s plans for Brexit, and also to the plans of our own government – the Executive and its senior officials – when it comes to the Magee Medical School.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that a Medical School at Magee had been agreed by the Executive with an anticipated September  opening. However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood amongst others sought further detail saying student intake next year was ‘far from certain’. Speaking at Stormont debate on the Budget Bill this week, DUP MLA Mervyn Storey - a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board - challenged the way finances have been distributed. googletag.cmd.push To fulfil the commitment made to police officers in the New Decade, New Approach document would cost poundm per year, he said, which the finance minister has available. He continued: “There are those who would like the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be run into the ground and be so constrained that would be incapable of dealing with public order and the many challenges that it faces.” The North Antrim MLA and former finance minister said poundm was allocated to the new medical facility in Derry. “When anyone looks at the current estimates for the running - the capital and the resource - of that project, the cost will be in excess of pound million. googletag.cmd.push “Some people are hanging their hats on the City Deal providing the additional money, but there is no doubt that it will have recurring costs that have to come back to the Executive,” he added. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Mr Storey went on to say that a ‘deal is a deal’ and in the New Decade, New Approach document there is an agreement to fund a medical school, and, on the opposite page, a commitment to increase police numbers to ,. It leads to the question, he said, what was the process to remove the medical school from the Department for the Economy and the Department of Health and move it to the Executive Office  “Why did that happen, given the fact that responsibility for the delivery of that project lay primarily in those two departments ” TIME RESTRAINTS In response Finance Minister Conor Murphy said: “First, in relation to the PSNI bid and the members view that it was part of a deal. “If it was part of a deal, it is not the responsibility of the Finance Minister to go in and demand that the Justice Minister brings forward a proposition. There is a party leaders forum, which, I think, was set up as a consequence of NDNA in order to discuss issues that might be outside the day-to-day workings of Departments. “If there is an argument that that commitment is not being met, I suggest to the member that that is the area in which to raise it and, hopefully, then secure an agreement. I am more than happy to play my part in that.” With regard to the Magee campus and Ulster University situation, the finance minister said there was a ‘time pressure on agreements’ that needed to be made about matched funding of the inclusive future fund and also about the intake for the graduate-entry medical school. “There was a lack of agreement between both departments on which one would have lead responsibility for that.” He concluded: “In those circumstances, correctly, the Executive Office and the offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister stepped in to try to arbitrate and find a way through that. “That is how it ended up in that department.” DERRY REPRESENTATIVES During the sitting, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she met with senior representatives of Ulster University and left the meeting with the sense that they were in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the medical school. “We need to know what is going on. We need more detail, and we need greater transparency. That applies to the British Governments plan for Brexit, but it also applies to the plans of our Government, the Executive Office and senior officials when it comes to the Magee medical school. “The medical school is due to open its doors in September . “Like every other elected representative and everybody in the city, I was delighted by the announcement, but a lot of work needs to be done for that to take place. It needs to be done very quickly, with a sense of urgency, and I urge the joint First Ministers to proceed at pace.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan commented: “You have two Derry representatives speaking one after another. “Not only are we obviously very passionate about where we come from but we are passionate about delivering the projects that have been worked on for many years. “The recent announcement of match funding for the Derry City and Strabane strategic growth plan and inclusive future fund, alongside the Executive commitment to open the medical school at Magee, are examples of what can and should be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that a Medical School at Magee had been agreed by the Executive with an anticipated September  opening. However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood amongst others sought further detail saying student intake next year was ‘far from certain’. Speaking at Stormont debate on the Budget Bill this week, DUP MLA Mervyn Storey - a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board - challenged the way finances have been distributed. googletag.cmd.push To fulfil the commitment made to police officers in the New Decade, New Approach document would cost poundm per year, he said, which the finance minister has available. He continued: “There are those who would like the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be run into the ground and be so constrained that would be incapable of dealing with public order and the many challenges that it faces.” The North Antrim MLA and former finance minister said poundm was allocated to the new medical facility in Derry. “When anyone looks at the current estimates for the running - the capital and the resource - of that project, the cost will be in excess of pound million. googletag.cmd.push “Some people are hanging their hats on the City Deal providing the additional money, but there is no doubt that it will have recurring costs that have to come back to the Executive,” he added. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Mr Storey went on to say that a ‘deal is a deal’ and in the New Decade, New Approach document there is an agreement to fund a medical school, and, on the opposite page, a commitment to increase police numbers to ,. It leads to the question, he said, what was the process to remove the medical school from the Department for the Economy and the Department of Health and move it to the Executive Office  “Why did that happen, given the fact that responsibility for the delivery of that project lay primarily in those two departments ” TIME RESTRAINTS In response Finance Minister Conor Murphy said: “First, in relation to the PSNI bid and the members view that it was part of a deal. “If it was part of a deal, it is not the responsibility of the Finance Minister to go in and demand that the Justice Minister brings forward a proposition. There is a party leaders forum, which, I think, was set up as a consequence of NDNA in order to discuss issues that might be outside the day-to-day workings of Departments. “If there is an argument that that commitment is not being met, I suggest to the member that that is the area in which to raise it and, hopefully, then secure an agreement. I am more than happy to play my part in that.” With regard to the Magee campus and Ulster University situation, the finance minister said there was a ‘time pressure on agreements’ that needed to be made about matched funding of the inclusive future fund and also about the intake for the graduate-entry medical school. “There was a lack of agreement between both departments on which one would have lead responsibility for that.” He concluded: “In those circumstances, correctly, the Executive Office and the offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister stepped in to try to arbitrate and find a way through that. “That is how it ended up in that department.” DERRY REPRESENTATIVES During the sitting, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she met with senior representatives of Ulster University and left the meeting with the sense that they were in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the medical school. “We need to know what is going on. We need more detail, and we need greater transparency. That applies to the British Governments plan for Brexit, but it also applies to the plans of our Government, the Executive Office and senior officials when it comes to the Magee medical school. “The medical school is due to open its doors in September . “Like every other elected representative and everybody in the city, I was delighted by the announcement, but a lot of work needs to be done for that to take place. It needs to be done very quickly, with a sense of urgency, and I urge the joint First Ministers to proceed at pace.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan commented: “You have two Derry representatives speaking one after another. “Not only are we obviously very passionate about where we come from but we are passionate about delivering the projects that have been worked on for many years. “The recent announcement of match funding for the Derry City and Strabane strategic growth plan and inclusive future fund, alongside the Executive commitment to open the medical school at Magee, are examples of what can and should be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Paddy Chivers, Adrian McGuckin, John Brennan, Brendan Convery and weeColeman were all vital in my progress as a footballer. I owe everything to the players and management who made all my successes possible.  - Damien McCusker  Easy solution here. This man was way ahead of his time in the number one spot. He played outfield for his club and it showed in his distribution and confidence with the ball. His kicking out was superb and would have found you with a ‘short’on. A big quiet leader and gentleman as well.Beer rating - ..  - Kieran McKeever  In his era, would have been the first man selected in any Derry side. He was the greatest corner back when you had to play corner back, giving me the freedom to go forward without having a worry behind me. Had many a spat with him in Dungiven colours and we always came out the other side as friends. Class personied.Beer rating –    - Kevin McCloy  Was too young to be about in Lavey’s really successful years but matured into a brilliant full-back. I coached him at U and never saw anyone who could read the game like him at that age. He deservedly got an all-star in  and gave Lavey and Derry many years of great service. Beer rating – .  - Tony Scullion  He would walk onto any team in the land. He didn’t like stretching and once smoked a cigarette while warming up. He didn’t fancy training one bit, yet he was imperious as a defender. This four all-stars tells the tale. He was unlucky not to win a county championship with a very good Ballinascreen team in those years. Beer rating – .   - Paul McFlynn  He played number five after I left the Derry team for many years and was a superb footballer. Paul was a very underrated tackler and always grabbed you a point at the other end. He was unbelievably instrumental in Loups two championship wins and their Ulster triumph. He was quiet but so influential on the pitch.Beer rating – .   - Anthony McGurk  Although, at , he made fleeting and telling impacts for our  team from the bench, I’m going to allow him in here. He is reason why the rest of us played football in the house. We grew up travelling everywhereto watch him. His Derry side wasnt far off the  side in terms of talent. A pure talent, legend, leader and a great influence our family.Beer rating . .  - Joe Irwin  When I came into the Derry team, Joe Irwin was the best player in our county bar none. There was a defiance, strength and ruggedness that yielded him unplayable. Unlucky not to be around in  but was a great player for Derry and a decent Drumsurn team of the ’s. Great lad too. Beer rating – . .  - Anthony Tohill  Anthony was simply the best as an all round player of my time. There was just no one to touch him. He was tall, strong, athletic, skillful, brainy, dedicated and had possessed two good feet. The big man was such a big gentleman as well – there is nothing more to say.Beer rating –  .  - Gregory McCartan . The single most reason why the Down of  regained their levels of . A midfielder who covered serious ground on the pitch and also could kick long range frees. He would always chip in with an odd point from play as well. He was a massive player for Down throughout the s and he could sing nearly as well as he played too! Beer rating –    - Dermot McNicholl  The greatest underage player of all time. I grew up at St Pat’s admiring and living in awe of Spoofer. A great leader in school for me as well as Derry minors. Superbly dedicated footballer who was unlucky not to start in , but made many telling contributions. You couldn’t talk about Derry football without mentioning him.Beer rating –  .  - Brian Conlon  I was a lucky man to play in the same Queen’s team and share a lecture theatre as well. He would have won two All-Ireland’s with Downnot for his serious injury. He had everything as a footballer, with two great feet and saw everything happening around him. He would have been a success at anything, shown by the companyhe grew. RIP Brian.  - Peter Canavan  One of the finest players to grace the pitch. He was unbelievably tricky in finding space and had two super feet. A massive influence for Tyrone in terms of scoring and leadership. The reason that Errigal Ciaran became so successful and why the song ‘oh you’ll never bring the Sam Maguire home’ was but to bed. Beer rating – . .  - Joseph Brolly  Joe was a real corner forward who always got you a handful of points in any game. He flourished in  for Derry and for many years after. One of the best club players I’ve ever played against in a really talented ‘sirs’ team of that era. A joy to play with and socialise with. Always full of the craic in training and games and still is! Beer rating –    - Mickey Linden  I played with him for Ulster in the Railway Cup and was delighted as it was a nightmare to play against him! He was possibly the best forward I have ever marked . A superb speedy corner forward who scored at will. A real gent as well.Beer rating –  .  - Enda Gormley  ‘Edna’ as he was known, was one of the most dedicated footballers I have ever played with. He trained like a professional and got what he deserved. I’ll never forget his days in Maghera Rec on the running machines. A great scorer from play and frees. He was part of a decent Watties side at the turn of the s. He had a fantastic All-Ireland final in , after getting a slap.Beer rating – . . RELATED - The club hurling team of the decade More...

Its fair to say that this crisis has made many of us pause for thought and re-evaluate not just our own behaviour but also many of our previous beliefs. Our new heroes are the cleaners, carers, delivery drivers, shop workers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, nurses and many other professions now commonly described as frontline workers. I was getting a few tyres on my car this week and when I asked the guy had they closed he said no we couldnt as we have a contract with the Ambulance Service and needed to be there to provide help for them and others who needed to go to work.” googletag.cmd.push Without these people putting their own lives at risk the death toll caused by coronavirus would have been off the charts. Prior to all of this, most people took for granted the work done by many of these iniduals. We never really gave it much thought. Now, however, we hail many of them as heroes. We clap for them and we now recognise how much better our society is because of their effort. As I said earlier, a global pandemic has really caused us to pause and reflect and hopefully recalibrate what we as a society should see as important. So, what should we learn from this crisis and what should we build on as a society after it  googletag.cmd.push I used the word recalibrate deliberately because I hope its not a temporary outpouring of sentiment for these many professions followed up by a speedyto the way things were before. Prior to the crisis we saw for example the care sector attract little of our attention or interest. Its a key sector with hundreds of thousands employed right across Ireland and the UK. Salaries are often minimum wage or just above. The work of caring for our loved ones and ensuring they have a good quality of le is often classed as low skilled. Their working conditions and pay never interested many of us or the press media but in this crisis their dedication to care for the most vulnerable members of our society has been astonishing. Their treatment by this government in regard to PPE and testing has cost the lives of hundreds of care workers. Weve clapped for everyone in the NHS and the care workers on many Thursday evenings in March and April. Hopefully after this crisis passes, we will support their right to be paid fairly for the essential frontline work they do. I could say the same for the thousands of cleaners who are on minimum wage and whose efforts kept hospitals and many other facilities open throughout the crisis. Also, think of the hospital porters and canteen staff who are often paid low salaries who risked their own exposure to the virus to care for others. The doctors and consultants are front and centre of this fight and their effort too has been exemplary but the vital effort of many others on the fringe cant be forgotten. And it hasnt just been the workers within the public sector or the low paid within the private sector that have stood out in this crisis. Without a doubt the contribution of charities, community enterprises, social enterprises and co-operatives right across these islands has been remarkable. From delivering vital food parcels to the needy, to making much needed PPE their effort in the midst of this crisis has been remarkable. Thousands of peoplein this city have seen first-hand and benefited first-hand from their efforts. Quite often the support they have given was only possible through thefinancial support from the public sector. This crisis should teach many within the public sector that these partnerships can bring real positive outcomes and should be built on rather than withdrawn after this passes. Many people in broader society see social enterprises often in a bad light. This is partially due to the narrow view of business being solely for profit and TV shows like theDragon’s Den dont help. In reality, Derry has many profitable well runsocial enterprises throughout the city and during this crisis many of them have stood with the community. Hopefully when this crisis is over, we wont allow ourselves to forget the people who kept the economy and society going. We will stand with them and support their calls for better pay and conditions. This week we already seen attempts by the Tories to make migrant NHS workers pay the surcharge be met with a public backlash. It forced the Tories to do a U-turn on the policy. People power does work. We really have to mobilise it more. And its not just me who thinks that this crisis provides the perfect  to build a fairer society. Jamie Dimon, the billionaire CEO of JP Morgan, said last week that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as awake-up call to build a better society. He added: It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long.” Jamie Dimon wrote this in a memo issued before the JP Morgan Annual Shareholders Meeting. He went on to say: The last few months have laid bare the reality that even before the pandemic hit, far too many people were living on the edge.” Mr Dimon is a billionaire banker andJoe Biden wins the US Presidency many believe he will the next Treasury Secretary of the United States. Im not a huge fan of a billionaire banker but I cant disagree with his sentiment. In the US the pandemic showed that the largest economy in the world had far too many workers living from pay cheque to pay cheque. So, as we move forward out of this crisis dont forget who the heroes in the economy were. This will of course mean us putting a higher value on the work that manyof them do.Its a national disgrace how we treat, pay and value the work that carers do. Is it too much to pay them more than pound. per hour to look after our mothers and fathers and grandparents  If you asked  people this question, Im sure the vast majority would agree that care workers are underpaid and undervalued. As a society we need to change this. Im optimisticthat the public sector will see the benefits of real partnerships with the social enterprise sector. The oftenreported public private partnership is not the only option. This crisis has shown that often the private sector is not able toin the same way as a social enterprise can. Finally, I hope that any attempt by politicians to short change or ignore the plight of the workers who held the frontline will be met with a swt backlash from the public. If paying public sector workers more means more taxes, then Im all for that. If increasing the minimum wage to pound per hour means increased prices, then the upside is a fairer society.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

However, concern has been raised about a group of young people who are harassing workers on the site. The construction of the new centre had to be stopped because of the lockdown restrictions. However, work has now recommenced following the easing of some aspects of the restrictions. A spokesperson for Shantallow Community Centre, however, said it was important that the contractors were allowed to get on with the project in peace. Unfortunately they are being harassed by a handful of local young people, the spokesperson said. googletag.cmd.push I am asking all parents and any adults to make a point of walking through the Donkey Field - community centre area when you can - out doing their daily exercise, walking the dog or just to check the site.

Council Animal Welfare Officers have been tasked with looking into the alleged incident after a report was made to the PSNI in January of this year. A PSNI spokesperson said: “Police in Mid Ulster received a report regarding cruelty to horses in the Magherafelt area in January . “Under the Welfare of Animals Act, District Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the legislation as it applies to non-farmed animals. “This would therefore include horses. The report was subsequently passed to Council Animal Welfare officers who are currently investigating the matter, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Council confirmed it was aware of the animal welfare complaint and a spokesperson said ‘an investigation is being undertaken into the case’. Images of the alleged incident were published online along with videos that appeared to show a horse with a bloodied mouth and missing front tooth. A further video appeared to show a horse with a rope tied from the fetlock strap over its neck to keep its head in a downward position. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone called for those responsible to be held to account. He said: “A lot of concern has been expressed to me personally and my party colleagues locally about footage which has appeared on social media. googletag.cmd.push “These allegations of abuse must be rigorously investigated and I have contacted Mid-Ulster Council, Animal Welfare, PSNI and the Minister at DAERA. “Abuse of harmless animals is despicable and those responsible must face heavy sentences for their hateful actions.” Mid Ulster councillor Malachy Quinn, who has been campaigning for an Animal Cruelty Register for Northern Ireland, also condemned alleged footage of the incident. “The pictures and videos that have been shared a quite sickening and disturbing,” he said. “This morning I sent an email to Mid-Ulster Council Chief Executive to seek assurances that it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency. “This time last year I started a campaign to introduce an Animal Cruelty Register, where those convicted of animal abuses would have their name placed on it and it could be accessed by animal charities and police to prevent those people having access to animals again. “Under present law they can easily get animals across the border or over in the UK. The events that have come to light over the weekend only strengthen the call for this register. “The videos and pictures show disgusting abuse of horses and the people who are subjecting them to this should never be allowed to own another animal. “The SDLP will be pushing the DERA Minster Edwin Poots to bring forward legislation to create a register and also the Justice Minister Naomi Long to bring in tougher sentences for Animal Abuse.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster District Council has the second-worst broadband provision of all Northern Ireland’s council areas, with some households unable to reach  Mbps. MLA for the area, Emma Sheerin, said that broadband was an essential utility for households. “It is a poor reflection on the state that basic utilities like broadband are still out of reach for some rural dwellers,” she said. “The fact that many of us are still in lockdown has meant that internet, which is already a necessary utility in most households, is even more essential. googletag.cmd.push “For those asked to work from home, for students attempting to complete school or university work, even for the most basic contact with friends and family, internet has been needed. This has exacerbated the frustrations of those for whom broadband is intermittent or non-existent, and anyone who has ever watched that wee wheel of buffering when trying to stream a video will know just how disheartening it is!” poundm of funding has been made available for the enhancement of rural broadband through Project Stratum, with just under , currently eligible for help. Ms Sheerin said it was vital the support was targeted at the premises that are most in need. googletag.cmd.push “Myself and my Sinn Feacutein colleagues reminded the department that there is another reality, namely the disparity that exists within the Up to  Mbps category,” she said. “I asked that homes on the smaller spectrum of speed be prioritised, so we would not see a situation where a house receiving broadband of  Mbps is improved to  Mbps, whilst another home  miles up the road, with a speed of  Mbps, wouldnt receive any help. “It was our fear thatcost efficiency was prioritised over need, those far off, hard to reach homes, would see no intervention, just because it was going to cost more to get to them. A delay to the roll out of the project has seen the number of eligible premises drop as broadband providers continue to improve their provision. “Due to upgrades by broadband providers, the number of homes with less than  Mbps broadband speed has decreasedby ,, from , to ,,” said Ms Sheerin. “I welcome this, but onlyit means that all , homes are helped, particularly those with the worst service to begin with. I have asked the minister that this be prioritised, and that work begins as soon as is possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cappry Rovers U-s - like a host of other young teams across Donegal - had entered the Foyle Cup in Derry, only for this summers tournament to be cancelled because of Covid-. Now the young players, coaches and parents have agreed to donate the € entry fee to the Donegal Hospice. Cora Harvey, who is Children’s Officer with Cappry Rovers FC, said it was a lovely gesture. “Obviously the young players and their coaches were really looking forward to the Foyle Cup,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “But it’s just one of those things. The tournament was cancelled and when their entry fee was ed, they decided it would be nice to donate it to charity.” The donation will be presented to the hospice, along with money raised in a virtual k fundraiser which Cappry Rovers are running this week.  The club normally hosts their annual k road race for the Joe Housten Cup on the June Bank Holiday weekend. But this year’s event was cancelled, and instead, the club is inviting people to check out their Facebook page for more details on their virtual k. Half of the proceeds raised will go to Donegal Hospice. googletag.cmd.push Anyone can take part in our Virtual k, Cora added. We have people entered from all over Donegal, and from Dublin and London too. Its just a bit of fun and its just € to enter. You can post your time when youre finished and half of the proceeds will go towards our club and the rest to Donegal Hospice. Full details of the fundraiser can be found on the Cappry Rovers Facebook page. The fundraiser started last Friday and will close at pm this coming Saturday, May .

In an extensive interview this weeks County Derry Post, the former Kingdom and Hogan Cup winning boss gives a Kerry slant to a feature on the minor clashes with Derry from  to . Derry have lost the services of Conor Glass and Callum Brown since minor level, with former U player Anton Tohill also lost to the AFL. Current Derry captain Chrissy McKaigue had a stint with Sydney Swans, and more recently Conleth McShane attended a AFL combine in Dublin before Christmas. googletag.cmd.push It was the same one Tohill and Oisin McWilliams attended two years ago. McWilliams later spent time in Australia with North Melbourne, in , but wasnt snapped up. Kerrys  goalkeeper Deividas Uosis and  winning captain Mark OConnor, both past pupils of Fitzmaurice have travelled down under, but their prize asset – David Clford – has stayed put. “It wasnt on his radar,” reveals Fitzmaurice of a meeting they had when he was senior manager. “He had no interest in going to Australia, or anywhere . Id say there were definitely approaches made but he wanted to play for Kerry and win All-Irelands with Kerry.” googletag.cmd.push On the flip side, Kerry lost OConnor to the AFL. He won two Hogan Cup medals under Fitzmaurice in Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. “He is a great guy and a big loss to Kerry,” Eacuteamonn states. “He got made an offer and decided to avail of it. From a Kerry perspective, it is up to us to make sure the players want to stay for the right reason. “If they do stay, they get a good education. There is a good job for them and they are well looked after to allow them to pursue an amateur sport. “Rather than giving out about it, it is always important to look in the mirror...is there anything we can do that would make a players le a bit easierthey do stay at home. David wanted to stay at home and we are delighted that he did.” Playing inter-county doesnt pay the bills, but Fitzmaurice sees a bigger picture. “When you are the manager of Kerry, thats what you want – for the players - to ensure the were happy in their personal and professional lives every bit as much as they are in their football lives. “If they are happy in their personal and professional lives, iniably they are going to be better footballers for it. Its not jobs for the boys, what you are trying to do is to encourage players to get a good education, to go down a route that they are interested in, so they can build a good career as well as being a successful footballer.” RELATED - Tohill waiting to make his mark.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue.

I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

But with the COVID- restrictions Irsquove decided to take the challenge on Zwt to avoid any risk of burdening the health service.Proceeds from the challenge will go to the mental health charities Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Services, also known as The Hub.ldquoOur lives have been turned upside down with the COVID- pandemic and many people are finding it dficult to cope with the changes, health concerns and isolation of it all, Alan continued.ldquoMental health issues can affect anyone and looking after our mental health is key to our overall emotional and physical wellbeing.ldquoSo far Irsquove raised almost pound and would really like to get to pound.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps. Just recently, Gerry made it back to the top of the famous landmark again mdash only this time he did it from the comfort of his own home.A decade ago, Gerry enjoyed good health and loved every minute of his visit to France but in  Loughinisland GACrsquos hard-working secretary contracted lung cancer, having never smoked a day in his le.In September that year, surgeons removed one of his lungs and between then and Christmas Gerry received chemotherapy treatment to assist his road to recovery.As a result of his illness, he was referred to Macmillanrsquos lsquoMove Morersquo initiative at Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick, which is specically designed to help people to get active and stay active with physical activity during and after most types of cancer treatment.Under the watchful eye of initiative co-ordinator Laura McGrath, Gerry loved the camaraderie of being with others referred by medical staff to take part in physical activity which can help educe the side effects of treatment, prevent the occurrence of other long-term conditions and reduce the risk of cancer spreading or ing.ldquoThere were just four of us at the start, recalled Gerry. ldquoWe started off in the old leisure centre which was subsequently replaced by a more modern building and there are now around  people who take part.ldquoWe all look forward to the classes every Thursday morning and after our warm-up routine we then proceed around a circuit and spend time on ious equipment, including a rowing machine. We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything. It was just the fillip that I required.

It will mean people can enjoy an evening together while still maintaining social distancing in the comfort of their own car.As a start, Cllr Devlin is keen to see a drive-in cinema in Newcastle to mark the start of her year in office.She explained that this would allow the local authority to gauge its success and how it complements the legislation on social distancing.ldquoHopefully after this, we may be in a position to roll this venture out across the entire district over the course of the year and include all our towns, said Cllr Devlin.ldquoAlready, this idea has gained a lot of support from local people which I think is a testament to the need that currently exists within all of us to connect and eventually interact with our family and friends once more.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThe test of how we unlock this will be in how we can continue to adhere to essential government guidelines on social distancing and ultimately defeating this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Paul.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul running in aid of MYMY  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man who has been running five kilometres every day since the beginning of the lockdown has raised over pound, for a local mental health charity.Paul Tumelty found himself with more time on his hands when the seaside coffee shop he worked in was forced to close its doors under government guidelines to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.The  year-old father of two, says he never thought of running until he saw a Facebook post from Mind Your Mate and Yourself , stating that the charity was struggling financially.It was forecasting ain income of pound, because of the cancellation or postponement of fundraising events.Paul, who has suffered from mental health issues, realised the importance of the charity after experiencing a number of family tragedies and decided he would help raise money to help them bridge the deficit.ldquoI always need to be doing something.

recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

than would normally be the case.ldquoIn normal circumstances we would have had a large crowd, since it is our flagship meeting of the year, he said.ldquoOnly industry officials, jockeys and trainers were allowed to attend, so we had around  people there in total.Commenting on theof racing, he said: ldquoIt is great to see the resumption of Irish racing in June. It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up.

However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

The Passionist Community provides free access to the trails for the benefit of the local community and this is greatly appreciated by the people of Crossgar in particular.Cllr Andrews described Tobar Mhuire as a ldquohaven of peace and tranquillity and appealed to people to stay away from the areas highlighted.He continued: ldquoNo one would want to see public access to the grounds prohibited and the Passionist Community has made this clear.ldquoIt is important that visitors recognise that Tobar Mhuire is home to elderly and vulnerable people, some of whom are self-isolating, and must not do anything that would potentially put their safety at risk. People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 UUP.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure.

However, for some reason that warning was not included in the inquiry’s letter to the two men.For instance, in the written questions sent to former DUP minister Jonathan Bell he was told: “It is vital that the witness statement you provide to the inquiry is your own evidence, absent the influence of others ...”He was also told – as were many other witnesses – that “you may share the correspondence and the enclosed notice with your legal representative, but neither you nor they may show, communicate the contents of, nor provide this correspondence or the notice to any other person or organisation without the express permission of the RHI Inquiry. Any breach of this duty of confidentiality is actionable at the suit of the inquiry chairman”.Mr Bell, again in common with many witnesses, did not receive an offer to meet the solicitor to the inquiry, Patrick Butler.However, in his letters to Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, Mr Butler said: “If it would assist you, I am happy to meet with youto discuss the requirements of the Section  Notice and what evidence you may be able to provide which is within the scope of the Section  Notice.”By contrast to the identical evidence provided by Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, when Sinn Fein ‘super spad’ Aidan McAteer was asked some of the same questions, his answers were worded dferently – as were those of the spad to then finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, Eoin Rooney.The questions to all of the Sinn Fein figures had been around an Ofgem employee, Edd Fyffe, who had contacted Sinn Fein in January  and presented himself as a whistleblower, setting out a series of allegations against Ofgem, which runs RHI for Stormont.Each of the republicans said that they had handled his allegations appropriately and neither they nor Mr Fyffe were called to give oral evidence to the inquiry.The News Letter asked whether Mr Howell or Mr Lynch discussed with each other how they would respond to the inquiry and,not,how they could explain the remarkable similarity between their answers.At the time of going to press, there had been no response, despite repeated requests for comment.Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, along with veteran IRA man Padraic Wilson, had been the triumvirate of senior republicans to whom Mr Ó Muilleoir passed a series of complex policy decisions around RHI – even though none of them are energy experts, lawyers or serve as spads who are bound by civil service codes.Amid alarm from senior civil servants, Mr Ó Muilleoir had asked Mr Howell: “Would you be contentI were to sign off on the business plan on Wednesday afternoon ”The former finance minister insisted that he had been merely consulting the influential republican close to Gerry Adams and not seeking his consent to the plan for retrospective cost controls.However, the RHI Inquiry ruled that was not what had happened and Mr Ó Muilleoir had indeed asked for the publicly unaccountable republican’s consent for the massive decision.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One,
