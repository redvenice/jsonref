Yesterday there was chaos..\u0027 Her concerns were echoed by Steve Double, the Tory MP for St Austell and Newquay, who said that day-trippers from outside of Cornwall should not be coming to the county.Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Double said: \u0027We are concerned about the next week as people come to places like Cornwall and abuse the new rules by sleeping over. \u0027The restrictions are clear that while people free to travel for day trips they are not permitted to sleep in camper vans or in tents overnight. \u0027We want to be able to welcome people a bit later in the year but we can only do that if we get on top of this virus. Do not come to Cornwall at this time.\u0027Young people in particular have admitted to getting tired of lockdown and a poll of 90,000 Britons found fewer than half of 19 to 30-year-olds are \u0027strictly\u0027 abiding by Britain\u0027s lockdown rules.The poll s found people are still sticking to the bulk of the rules but are starting to ignore things like keeping two metres apart.Among all adults, complete compliance has fallen from 70 per cent to under 60 per cent in the last fortnight.While among young adults it has dropped from a high of 60 per cent in mid-April to around 45 per cent by May 17.University College London scientists, behind the survey, also said there had been a drop off in confidence in the Government since it switched its stance from \u0027stay at home\u0027 to the more ambiguous \u0027stay alert\u0027 on May 10.Lead author Dr Daisy Fancourt, of UCL\u0027s epidemiology and health care unit, said: \u0027Confidence in Government has fallen in England since the easing of lockdown was announced, and is lowest in those under the age of 30.\u0027The ongoing study - launched in the week before the UK shut down on March 24 - quizzed adults about how they are feeling on a range of issues during the pandemic.These include the lockdown, Government advice, their overall wellbeing and mental health.It also found that 95 per cent of all adults felt they are either \u0027reasonable\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 at sticking to the measures.Those questioned were asked to rate the Government\u0027s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic from one to a top mark of seven.Their view of the Government\u0027s performance had dropped from five at the beginning of lockdown to around four, according to those who were questioned between May 11-17.Levels of anxiety and depression had not improved since the easing of lockdown, while worries about possibly getting ill from Covid-19 had fallen slightly.Fears about food, finance and unemployment were a cause of stress for some people.The researchers found that around one in 12 people said they were worried about unemployment, while around one in eight people were worried about finances.Stress about being able to get enough food had stabilised in the past week, with fewer than one in 20 people saying they were worried about this.Exclusive: Virus fading in London as major hospitals report no deaths in 48 hours"},{"url":null,"title":"Amazon pushes Prime Day September returns pre pandemic levels","story":"Share this articleAmazon Targets Fall for Prime Day as it Tries to Return to Pre-Pandemic Operations - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Immunity certificates allow people recovered coronavirus freed lockdown","story":"Share this article   Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who urged the PM in the Commons on Wednesday to scrap the charge, said: \u0027Boris Johnson is right to have U-turned and backed our proposal to remove the NHS charge for health professionals and care workers.\u0027This is a victory for common decency and the right thing to do.

Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

When heated, the perovskite outgasses – degrading the material.“Perovskite cells will need to stack up against the current commercial standards. That’s what is so exciting about our research. We have shown that we can drastically improve their thermal stability.”Solar cells that are used commercially need to be able to withstand years of exposure to weather.Ho-Baillie said the early perovskite solar cells only lasted a few days before degrading. The perovskite crystals are cheaper, Ho-Baillie said, than the glass they used to help cover the cells.The team devised the glass and synthetic rubber surround and then put the cells through three sets of international standard tests, which include repeatedly cycling the cells through temperatures of -40C to 85C, as well as exposing them to high humidity levels.“It’s a world first to pass these three tests in a low-cost way,” said Ho-Baillie. “Not only did the cells pass the thermal cycling tests, they exceeded the demanding requirements of damp-heat and humidity-freeze tests as well.”“Perovskite opens the market in ways that we hadn’t thought of. It’s lightweight, it’s flexible, and you could fold it up and roll it out. For us, the sky is the limit.”She said her team was also testing a form of the solar cells for use in space, and were currently “torturing it” with space plasma.R\u0026ampD programs on perovskite solar cells are under way around the world, including at the US Department of Energy, several European research ventures, and Australia’s CSIRO.As well as recording success in the tests, Ho-Baillie’s research team also report in Science the use of a technique that was able to isolate and measure the way the perovskite crystals degraded.The research was supported by the Australian government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which is also funding a suite of research and development projects to push perovskite cells to commercialisation.Dr Klaus Weber, an associate professor at the Australian National University and an expert in emerging solar cell technology including perovskite cells, who was not connected to the study, said it was “an important step along the way to commercialisation.”He said: “This is an important achievement which demonstrates the potential of this new technology to further lower the already low costs of photovoltaics.“The study shows that one of the key concerns with the technology, namely its limited stability, can be addressed with good engineering.“I would caution, however, that the commercialisation of a new technology is a long and complicated process, and that it requires many years before such a new technology becomes widely available. So, don’t hold off installing solar panel in the belief that something better will be available tomorrow.”Weber said perovskite technology was “of intense interest” because it combined “a rare combination of highly desirable properties”.The technology offered multiple “and potentially very cheap” ways of making solar cells, could be modified across different applications and allowed more efficient cells to be produced.He added: “Typical layers have a thickness about one-hundredth the diameter of a human hair. This means that material costs can be very low as well – which is important when you want to make many square kilometres of product.“Given their promise, it is not surprising that many researchers are attracted to the challenge of improving the understanding of this technology and making better solar cells.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4734cde7e7424113d4a2a3efa010aebfa08913b2/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6151913ba2e4a782a9f9ac66449605ea","title":"what would negative interest rates mean for mortgages and savings","story":"Variable-rate mortgages may fall a little, and it seems unlikely banks will charge to hold savingsThe governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has paved the way for negative interest rates, saying officials are actively considering all options to prop up the economy.If it’s a fixed-rate mortgage, nothing. And most households are on this type of deal – in recent years around nine in 10 new mortgages have been taken on a fixed rate.If it is a variable-rate mortgage – a tracker, or a mortgage on or linked to a lender’s standard variable rate – the rate could fall a little if the base rate is cut. But the drop is likely to be limited by terms and conditions. David Hollingworth, of the mortgage brokers London \u0026amp Country, says trackers sold very recently have in some cases had a “collar” that prevents the lender from having to cut the rate at all. Skipton building society, for example, has a tracker at 1.29 percentage points above the base rate that can only go up.You will need to dig out your paperwork to see how low your mortgage rate could go.Tracker mortgages have been pulled and repriced with larger margins, to cushion lenders against falling rates. If rates are cut again, expect more of that, as well as the collars already seen on some deals.A negative base rate means banks and building societies have to pay to keep money on deposit, and it is designed to discourage them from doing so and make them keen to lend. Andrew Hagger, the founder of the financial information website Moneycomms, says he thinks it is unlikely banks will start charging people to hold their everyday savings. “Many would just withdraw cash and possibly keep it in the house, thus opening a can of worms around security and break-ins,” he says. “However, if the Bank of England did introduce negative rates, I’m sure we would see even more savings accounts heading towards zero.”Rachel Springall, from the data firm Moneyfacts, says: “The most flexible savings accounts could face further cuts should base rate move any lower or if savings providers decide they want to deter deposits.”She is not ruling out a charge for deposits. “Some savings accounts could go down this path – similar to how some banks charge a fee on a current account,” she says.“It could be that super-rich clients in the UK get charged a similar fee as the commercial banks may wish to discourage large cash holdings which they are having to pay for,” says Hagger.Personal loan rates are already low and are usually fixed, so you will not see your monthly repayments fall if rates go down. Credit card rates are usually low for new customers, but rise far above the base rate once introductory periods have ended, so will not be anywhere close to falling into negative territory.Hagger says he does not expect card or loan rates to plummet in the near future, “as I think banks will continue to tighten their credit underwriting – I think they’ll be more concerned about rising bad debt levels due to a surge in unemployment, for the remainder of 2020 at least.”This month Virgin Money closed the credit card accounts of 32,000 borrowers after carrying out “routine affordability checks”. It later reversed the decision, but this could be a sign that lenders are reviewing their customer bases and trying to reduce their risk.

The Covid-19 crisis is a mirror held up to each nation. Some, such as Jacinda Ardern’s New Zealand, look very good indeed. Many have celebrated an unfamiliar unity, solidarity and selflessness, praising as distinctively Spanish, Italian or Danish the very same qualities that just across the frontier are being lauded as Portuguese, French or Swedish. Others, such as the United States and Poland, are tragically revealed as incapable of achieving national solidarity even when faced with such an external threat. Instead they appear more politically polarised than ever, like a man whose right arm is fully engaged in wrestling with his own left arm while a tiger mauls his back.How does Britain look in the Covid-19 mirror? Let’s start with the good news. At the end of last year, the ide between Brexiters and remainers seemed miles deep. These were the new tribes replacing political parties, it was suggested, and the civil war between them might last for decades. Yet there was neither Brexiter nor remainer when Covid-19 came to call. We pulled together. Unlike Donald Trump, Boris Johnson has shown due respect for the science around this pandemic. As in many other European countries, Britain’s weekly evening applause and widespread volunteering in support of health and care workers has been genuinely moving. The “whatever it takes” economic response of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the Bank of England has been swift, bold and fundamentally correct.Now for the bad news. Britain’s muddled handling of the Covid-19 crisis has put another big dent into what used to be its reputation for good government. Although Brits have come together across the Brexit ide, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have each had different public health responses, highlighted particularly by Scottish nationalist leader, Nicola Sturgeon. The most striking thing, however, has been the way that Britain in general, and England in particular, has reverted to a nostalgic celebration of our shared past in the second world war, with no corresponding sense of a shared future.There have been times over the last few weeks when it has felt as if we were living through a permanent, looped replay of Dad’s Army, the TV comedy series about Britain’s Home Guard in the second world war. The unchallenged media hero of this crisis is Captain Tom, the 100-year-old war veteran celebrated for raising millions of pounds for the NHS by doing a sponsored walk around his garden. Not a day goes by without more photographs of him in his blue blazer and campaign medals, and he has just been given a knighthood. Spitfires flew overhead to mark his 100th birthday. Mentions of Winston Churchill and the blitz are two a penny. The forces’ sweetheart, Vera Lynn, now 103, has been back in the charts with her wartime hit We’ll Meet Again – quoted by the Queen in a televised broadcast to the nation in the slightly more Queen’s English version, “We will meet again”. This wartime nostalgia reached a peak around VE Day, helpfully explained by one Daily Mail souvenir blurb as the day Britain celebrates its “victory over Europe”.I am irresistibly reminded of the comment made by a former US ambassador that the British “seem to know mainly what they used to be”. Now, before some dyspeptic columnist hands me the journalistic equivalent of the white feather, let me affirm that the British are absolutely right to be proud of their wartime record. What our parents and grandparents did under Churchill’s leadership in 1940 really was in many ways our “finest hour”, and if we Brits can still draw strength and inspiration from it, good.The trouble is that this justified pride in that past is not matched by any corresponding vision for the future. Yet to be a nation in good mental health requires a sense both of where you are coming from and where you want to go. Ideally, you want a narrative connecting the two. It is a somewhat painful irony that Germany has managed to turn its own horrendous second world war record into the starting point of such a positive narrative, as its president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, demonstrated in a magnificent speech on VE Day, while Britain seems to have only the retrospective half.The main reason, however, for there being no shared vision of the future is that … we have no shared vision of the future. The Johnson government, in particular, represents an ultra-Brexity “very well, alone!” fantasy which is not shared even by many Conservatives.In Spain’s transition to democracy in the 1970s, after a bitter civil war and a long night of dictatorship, it was felt that the price of national unity was amnesia. In Britain after Brexit, the price of national unity is nostalgia.Yet precisely in this crisis we see what some of the ingredients of that shared future could be. A country that has superb scientists and universities, with an Oxford University team possibly about to create one of the first effective Covid-19 vaccines in the world and Imperial College London not far behind. A country with outstanding public service broadcasting – the BBC has had a good Covid-19 “war” – and other first-rate media and creative industries. A parliamentary democracy that functions well even when most of its representatives can’t physically meet in parliament. A society with a deep commitment to its National Health Service and to a strong welfare state. A place where doctors and nurses from all around the world, and British-born ethnic minorities too, take the lead in saving the lives of others, including that of the prime minister himself, tended in intensive care by nurses from Portugal and New Zealand.The question now is who can articulate a vision for Britain in 2040, not 1940. Step forward Labour’s new leader, Keir Starmer, and propose a future to match Britain’s best past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38319743b961c6c245830a2ac9b7a67965c3bf19/0_361_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7bef8a2237e880f349a8007c1254200","title":"if we can do without gcses and university exams now why go back","story":"Abandon this addiction to assessment.

There are some blessings to Covid-19, and one may yet be to liberate education from the dictatorship of “the test”.The government has already abandoned this year’s GCSEs and A-levels, replacing them with a bureaucratic miasma of calculated and standardised grades in a frantic attempt to keep its beloved metrics alive.

This is largely because scribbling numbers on paper is the easiest way the authorities can measure, compare and regulate children, pandering to “an unhealthy fixation for assessment, an addictive fix for policy-makers to push”. Maths is the apotheosis of the exam, with its pretence of exactitude. To me, Wolfram portrays maths exams as like taking a driving test with a horse and cart. It needs to take over where the computer leaves off, in a world of calculated uncertainty, risk and, dare we say it, common sense. If overnight we can do without GCSE exams – surely never to return – what about A-levels? They have become the national entry ticket to a job or university, freeing employers and admissions officers from having to assess and treat young people as iniduals. There are signs that policymakers are waking up to this. The Whitehall 2020 guidance on awarding qualifications calls on universities to “take a holistic approach” on how to admit students, whatever that means.At least the A-level exam is a rite of passage, but why universities need to hold exams escapes me. Their students are paying them for a service. If they do not like it, or it does not like them, they can leave. Education lies in the totality of the course, not something that can be written down on paper. Exams are a make-work scheme for dons merely to see “who is top”.Here, push has really come to shove. Oxford has abolished its first-year exams for this year, baldly stating: “Students will be assumed to have passed.” Some universities are refashioning their climactic exam as an “open-book” test, an online, home-bound experience with a clock ticking. Students may dispense with pen and paper, but stern “honour” warnings are issued against plagiarism – or as the satirist Tom Lehrer said, “call it research”. This must be a huge advantage to those with quiet, well-equipped studies and nifty copy-and-paste skills.To the obvious solution – Oxford assuming everyone who finishes a course has “passed” – the protest is, what about class of degree as ticket to ride? This bluff, too, has been called. In 2017 the accountancy giant, Grant Thornton, made a dramatic discovery. It had been screening its annual 10,000 applicants for graduates with firsts and 2:1s. For some reason – perhaps a CEO with a 2:2 – it dropped this barrier in favour of intensive interviews. It subsequently found more recruits with “poorer” degrees became high fliers than those with higher ones. Degree class was actually a negative indicator of future achievement. A subsequent Bridge Group survey found class of degree was not even cited for City jobs, as against “behaviour at interview”. There are no degrees in that.Universities now face a horrendous challenge. They are about to lose tens of thousands of lucrative overseas students. Their finances are in ruin. According to the Office for National Statistics, a third of all graduates are doing jobs for which no degree is needed, and that is likely to worsen. Meanwhile Google, Wikipedia and online data have transformed the world of information, learning and research. Yet universities are stuck with three and four-year courses, long holidays and a fixation with exams.So why not an experiment? Edinburgh, Manchester, Cambridge and others have already put their lectures online, Cambridge for an entire year. It is hard to see why they should ever revert. Who needs a lecture hall when you can sit in Starbucks with a book and a laptop? A live university is about two-way interaction. When it comes to exams, for one year at least, let “the class of 2020” be assumed to have passed “with honour”. Then, say five years on, let us investigate if freedom from exams had really harmed them, or rather allowed them that essence of learning, more contact between teacher and taught. Something tells me these would be the gilded ones of their generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99ae2c5b1a6c4b664ece008f58289ac2b00ed55e/0_325_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90da5abe17364636d534a0d09659975b","title":"the guardian view on covid 19 politics a government in disarray","story":"Boris Johnson’s necessary U-turn on NHS fees for overseas health and care workers reveals a leader who is no longer in control of policyThe first virtual proceedings of the House of Commons began on 21 April as a result of the national lockdown. They have lasted for a month. The system was brought to a peremptory halt this week by the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg. When the Commons returns on 2 June, MPs will no longer be allowed to take part in proceedings from their homes. Electronic voting, which began on 12 May, will come to an end too. The ending of the virtual Commons is in reality intended to bring an increasingly awkward parliament back to heel. But it could easily have the opposite effect.While Mr Johnson has struggled, cabinet ministers like Thérèse Coffey at the Department for Work and Pensions and Robert Buckland at justice have wandered significantly off-message on fundamental aspects of the government’s handling of the pandemic, respectively on its claims to “follow the science” and to treat care homes on a par with the NHS. The former business secretary Greg Clark also wrote to Mr Johnson on behalf of the science select committee this week, saying that testing capacity had been “inadequate for most of the pandemic so far” – a devastating judgment just as ministers battle to get a system in place in England by 1 June.Meanwhile, there have also been significant revolts on the Conservative backbenches. In the first, on agricultural standards in any post-Brexit trade treaty with the US, 23 Tory MPs voted against the government. This week, No 10’s efforts to put its own man in charge of the Commons liaison committee that supposedly holds Mr Johnson to account provoked 16 Tory rebels. A day after Westminster closed for Whitsun, No 10 was forced into the humbling U-turn on the migrant workers health surcharge after another much larger and more damaging Tory revolt forced Mr Johnson to backtrack. The prime minister’s ascendancy looks more fragile now.In the context of a pandemic in which more than 250,000 inhabitants of this country have tested positive for Covid-19 and in which more than 36,000 have now died, the government’s parliamentary travails must be kept in proper perspective. Nevertheless, its political problems at Westminster are a striking metaphor for its wider mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. When the pandemic struck in March, virtual proceedings should have been introduced immediately, but were not. When the emergency system kicked in, it worked better than expected. But as it took root, the government came under challenge. Things started to go wrong in many areas. Other governments seemed to handle the pandemic better. Like Mr Johnson when he loosened the lockdown, Mr Rees-Mogg has now lurched prematurely back to the old normal, but without proper preparations in place. This is a government in disarray.The Tory high command clearly hopes that a recess and a full return to Westminster will enable it to run a much tighter ship. In fact, Mr Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg are still busking it, as the latest U-turn shows. They are hoping that something will turn up. They would like to shift the argument back from health to Brexit. But the pandemic is not going away. Instead, it is exposing the government’s failures and inadequacies more brutally with every day that passes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabbc26b55415263acbebbe4fdbf110c0fc76d84/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=180614ea8ad75b14b42c45e839f163c0","title":"manchester becomes latest uk city to delay clean air zone","story":"Leeds, Birmingham and Bath also push back green plans and blame coronavirus pandemicThe creation of the biggest clean air zone in the UK to tackle illegal levels of air pollution is being delayed by a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.Greater Manchester became the latest city to announce it was putting off the implementation of a clean air zone (CAZ), raising concerns that a green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis was being put on hold.The planned CAZ covers 10 local authority areas and was to be the biggest in the country. HGVs, LGVs, buses and taxis would be charged to enter the zone if they did not meet nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions standards. Private cars would not be charged.Andrew Western, the leader of Trafford council, said on Wednesday the CAZ would be delayed until 2022, a year later than planned, because of the difficulty in carrying out widespread consultation while ensuring physical distancing.Dr Andy Whittamore, a GP in Portsmouth and Asthma UK’s clinical lead, says that viruses are a trigger for asthma and asthma symptoms, and therefore it is fair to assume that coronavirus will act in the same way.Health bodies around the world are listing asthma as a condition that might be considered high risk, but so far there is no evidence to suggest that having asthma increases the infection rate from the coronavirus. There is, though, some evidence that people who have asthma and catch the coronavirus are more likely to go on to have a more severe case of Covid-19. There is yet to be any data which shows how asthma impacts on the mortality rate from the coronavirus, but doctors are advising that people with the condition try to manage their asthma symptoms as best they can in case they catch the coronavirus.Asthma is a condition of the airways, causing inflammation. It can lead to wheezing, coughing and a tight chest, and be triggered both by internal factors in the body, like levels of hormones, and external factors, like viruses, pollution and allergens. Colds and flu are considered a major trigger.He said the authority was asking the government for £166m, including £98m for a clean commercial vehicle fund and £10m to help sole traders most affected by the shift to cleaner vehicles. Only £41m had so far been received.Western said the lockdown had resulted in large falls in NO2 in Greater Manchester and nationally. “That’s something we want to ensure can become a permanent feature.”He said a delay should not affect the ability of Greater Manchester to comply with legal air pollution limits.Leeds, Birmingham and Bath have also said they would delay the introduction of clean air zones. Birmingham and Bath have delayed until 2021 at the earliest, while Leeds said its measures to cut illegal levels of NO2 from traffic, due to start in September, would be put back “until further notice”. Oxford is delaying its zero emission zone.Birmingham city council asked the government’s joint air quality unit to delay the launch of the zone until at least the end of the calendar year, to be kept under review.Kate Nield, a clean air lawyer for ClientEarth, which successfully took the government to court over its failure to tackle illegal air pollution levels, said she was alarmed by the delay announced by Greater Manchester.“Local leaders have provided no explanation as to why the current circumstances have triggered a delay of at least another year and a half before any meaningful action to tackle air pollution commences,” she said.“Greater Manchester has already missed too many government-imposed deadlines. It’s not right that people are having to wait so long for action to protect their health from toxic air.“The law makes it clear: plans to tackle illegal pollution in the shortest possible time must be put in place as soon as can be. This seems especially important now that our cities and towns are recovering from a virus that affects people’s respiratory health.”The UK courts have ordered the government to bring air pollution levels down to legal limits in the shortest possible time.A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the cities had made their decisions to delay after discussions with government.Other cities where clean air zones are planned to bring air pollution to within legal limits are Southampton, Derby – which is opting for traffic management, not charging – and Bristol.Bristol has proposed the most radical policy, voting to totally ban all privately owned diesel vehicles from the city centre during the day. The scheme is due to start in 2021.In London, Sadiq Khan has already introduced an ultra-low emissions zone in the city centre, which is due to be expanded to the North and South Circular roads in 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b30a743e4fba8109fbe4eb13805dc2f07d728c3f/0_14_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=42b745c28d18290e963b7eb8d5a22135","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool clothes keys to coaching team talks kick it out","story":"Liverpool’s manager took part in a mentoring session set up by Kick It Out and shared what he thinks it takes to succeed“Your football has to be mirrored by your soul,” Jürgen Klopp says as he explains why his appearance on the touchline has no effect on his team’s performance. Liverpool’s manager is midway through a fascinating answer about his dress code and has an important message for the aspiring coaches listening to him on Zoom. “You have to bring your own character in.”This is an unusual setting for Klopp. It is Liverpool’s first day back in phase one training but the manager of the Premier League’s dominant force has given up part of his afternoon to take part in a mentoring session for Kick It Out, football’s anti-discrimination charity. Troy Townsend, Kick It Out’s head of development, has got top coaches involved in the organisation’s Raise Your Game programme – England’s Gareth Southgate is another star attraction – and has landed Klopp.Gerald Lami, who works at Juventus’s academy in Oman, and Taff Rahman, a Football Association coach educator, are the pair lucky enough to be picking Klopp’s brain, and the  has been invited to sit in on the call. Lami, buzzing as he holds up a copy of Klopp’s autobiography, takes a risk with a question about the German’s fashion sense. “Coming as a refugee to England, appearance is something I’ve always been kind of cautious about,” the 29-year-old says. “I’ve been critical of myself and made sure I’m well dressed. But when I look at you, I don’t see a traditional coach in terms of a suit. How did you go against that traditional look?”The manager of the European champions listens intently before letting out a booming laugh. “Interesting,” Klopp says. “What I can read between the lines is that I look like a tramp on the sidelines?”Klopp has taken a shine to Lami, who tells the former Borussia Dortmund manager about moving to England from Albania when he was a boy, his challenging upbringing in east London and falling into a downward spiral after struggling to make it as a footballer. Lami fell in with the wrong crowd and it was only after he was stabbed that he went down a path that has led to coaching in the Middle East. Klopp is impressed and he does not mind being asked about his lack of sartorial elegance.“I was a player and the next day I was the manager,” Klopp says, remembering how he got his break at Mainz at the age of 35. “In my locker room was the tracksuit of the guy who had the job two days before. It didn’t even fit me. I was just focused on the game. I never thought about how I look. I know it’s not too cool because we are working in public but then when I came to Borussia Dortmund I thought: ‘Maybe I have to change.’ I went for a while wearing jeans and a shirt. But I just didn’t feel comfortable.“But that doesn’t mean it’s bad for you. I think the best-dressed manager is Pep Guardiola. Everything he wears looks exactly right for him. He doesn’t wear a suit, just casual stuff. It’s interesting what you told me about being a kid who came to England as a refugee. Maybe what is deep in yourself is a little bit of lack of confidence. You think you have to convince people with the way you look.”As Klopp enters full motivational mode it becomes obvious to see how he connects with his players. He wants Lami to trust himself but also points out the ultimate test will be how his team look on the pitch.“Be yourself as a coach,” Klopp says. “If you want to look great, then wonderful. I’m just not made for this. It’s important you do what is right for you because whatever role model you have, you can never do the same things. I like when you see the soul or character of the coach in the team. Guardiola again: you see a team and think: ‘Wow, that’s either Guardiola or somebody who worked with him.’ But you can never be exactly the same. Dressing is one part of our character. Wear what you want, but don’t make it the most important thing. In the end the game is what counts. But don’t worry: you can be world champion in a suit or a tracksuit. You just have to be comfortable.”Lami wants to know the secret of Klopp’s self-belief. “I was full of confidence as a kid,” he says. “Whatever I did my mother said: ‘Brilliant.’ My father said: ‘Sensational.’ I got filled with love. I don’t doubt people. I am completely open. I have nothing to hide. I give everything but I don’t expect I get something for it.”Klopp’s acceptance that defeat is part of life has been a key part of his success at Liverpool, who are within touching distance of winning their first title in 30 years. “I give everything. I expect my players to give everything. Then we see what we get. That creates the mentality of the team.”Rahman, part of the former Birmingham and Derby defender Michael Johnson’s staff when Guyana reached the Gold Cup for the first time last year, asks about communication. For Klopp, the key is thinking about the message. “I know myself well,” he says. “I trust myself to say the right thing in the right moment.”The mind goes back to Liverpool’s finest escape acts under Klopp: the Europa League quarter-final win over Dortmund and fighting back from a 3-0 defeat in the first leg to reach the Champions League final at Barcelona’s expense last season. “Against Dortmund we were 3-1 down at half-time. Before the game you have no idea what you will say at half-time. I said: ‘Boys, this is the day we create a story we can tell our grandchildren.’Preparation helped Liverpool go on their 44-game unbeaten run in the league. “How do we get to 10 games in a row?” Klopp says. “It’s exactly the same as 40 games in a row. You should think more positively about yourself. It’s not difficult to keep yourself in line. We win a game, I’m happy. The next day, I don’t think about that game.“I lost six finals in a row. That doesn’t mean I will not try again. We did that 44 times. But we did the same before the Watford game, which we lost. We are human beings. None of us are perfect. I get up in the morning and have a smile on my face. Can the boys disappoint me? Not really. If something doesn’t work out, I think my message wasn’t clear enough, not that they are too dumb to get what I told them. But why should I be unhappy with myself? I just have to improve my message.”With the clock ticking Klopp is asked for two more tips. “If you are really ambitious you have to understand the game,” he says. “The interesting fact with football is pretty much everybody thinks he is an expert. It’s a nice game, a simple game. But it’s not easy. That’s why so many people think they understand it but stop so early. There are lot of things to learn. A lot of things to watch. You have to learn constantly.“The moment you stop learning, the game develops. I started 20 years ago. Is it the same game? No. It’s so much more physical, so much quicker. The other thing is be yourself. You have no other chance. The moment you try to act like somebody else, you constantly think: ‘What would he do?’ Be yourself and learn more about the game. Then I would say there’s a big chance we play against each other. Why not?”Klopp laughs again before saying goodbye. It is time to train."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0007b948970d41f4787580055e1703adb4047fc/0_381_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7a4dd63c452030f991bfa688060fcc1","title":"the issue now is surviving countries react with shock to oxfam withdrawal coronavirus","story":"Locals, NGOs and politicians express fears for world’s most vulnerable as charity announces withdrawal from 18 countries due to financial impact of Covid-19Oxfam International’s announcement that it will close operations in countries including Afghanistan and Haiti has prompted fears that regions are being abandoned just as the coronavirus pandemic makes them more vulnerable.Oxfam said the impact of Covid-19 on its finances had forced it to fast-track a global restructuring programme, which entails the closure of 18 country offices.The NGO was already trying to deal with a drop in public donations after the Haiti sex abuse scandal in 2018. Oxfam’s finances have been further hit by having to close its shops as a result of coronavirus restrictions, losing it £5m every month.Civil society groups and social workers are concerned the dramatic changes might signal a scaling-back of the role NGOs play in providing vital services.Social worker Modaser Islami said the closure of Oxfam’s Afghanistan office, which opened in 1961, will leave big gaps in aid provision, especially in rural areas.“The issue right now is not about improving our situation, it’s about surviving. There are more and more people coming on to the streets asking for help and without it, they say they wouldn’t be able to eat,” said Islami.He fears the Afghan government is not in a strong enough position to support the country’s poorest if aid groups begin leaving and foreign governments do not help plug the gap.“It’s most worrying because the type of work Oxfam has been doing improved livelihoods in rural areas where most others don’t reach, both aid groups and governments,” he said. “They have no other sources of incomes, just a little land, and face challenges getting healthcare, also education.”Oxfam closures will affect offices in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, and result in the loss of 1,450 programme staff.Pedro Vega, a member of a farmers’ association in Paraguay that received support from Oxfam, said the NGO’s withdrawal was a great loss.“Oxfam helped our association to make a very important leap forward,” he said. “It showed that if NGOs’ projects are well implemented, they can create change, help construct a different way of living in the countryside and get our produce the real value that it deserves.”Oxfam has been in Paraguay for 28 years and worked collaboratively with more than 60 local organisations on projects including those promoting women’s rights and sustainable development.In a statement, Óscar López, head of Oxfam Paraguay, said: “We hope that our contribution to strengthening civil society will continue to bear fruit.”Carlos Mejia, the executive director of Oxfam in Colombia, said: “The decision to leave countries was anything but easy, it was a painful decision.”Insiders say Oxfam’s restructuring is expected to impact other parts of the charity in the coming weeks, including at its Oxford headquarters in the UK.An Oxfam GB spokesperson said that aside from the announcements made by the international charity, its largest national affiliate will now have to reduce its expenditure and review plans made before the pandemic.Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the House of Commons international development committee, said the announcement will “further concern struggling communities who rely on the assistance of aid organisations”.Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, whose committee is examining the impact of the pandemic on developing countries, said the loss of income for NGOs was already having a chilling effect on their work.“We have received evidence that NGO charities are suffering huge losses of income due to lockdown and as donor governments, businesses and iniduals all feel their own economic and financial challenges. This is already starting to have a chilling effect on the humanitarian and development capacity of UK NGOs and their crucial work abroad.”Stephanie Draper, the CEO of Bond, the international development network, said: “It’s really sad to see such a big name not being able to respond to the real need in countries around the world.”The challenges of the coronavirus presented a “bleak picture for our members right now”, Draper added.Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children, said: “Oxfam is a brilliant organisation that does desperately needed work across all of these countries. I’m very sad that, because of the financial situation they are in, they have had to make these decisions. All of us are saddened by it.”Save the Children does not have any plans to cut programmes, he said.Among the closures will be Oxfam’s office in Haiti, a country that has had a complicated relationship with international charities. It has yet to respond publicly to the planned closure.Locals have relied heavily on NGOs for care and support, which at times have supplanted government assistance.When the 2010 earthquake turned much of the country’s capital Port-au-Prince to rubble, around 10,000 aid organisations assisted with the recovery. In Jacmel, a city on the southern coast of Haiti, international NGOs have distorted the workforce, something that will be felt when they leave.“People working for INGOs pay good money for their cars, homes, and other services, but now without employment, they won’t be able to keep it going,” said Huguens Saintil, who works with a small foundation in Jacmel. “Locals had the feeling that foreigners are the solution to their problems instead of fighting to resolve them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd6a3d9a3ad23b78c34b6499980233b1117c0634/0_1539_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a800f1b6be065ef8d3b615aa0c99f10","title":"unleash the quiche 10 mouthwatering recipes to try from seafood to blue cheese","story":"Forget the stodgy staple of dreary picnics – it’s only a lack of imagination that holds back this easy-to-transform egg tart. You’ll never eat quiche lorraine again!Quiche has a branding problem. The stodgy staple of the British summertime is often seen as nothing more than a beige egg pie, served old and cold on buffet tables with other stale classics such as pork pies and scotch eggs.Its main problem is also its biggest success: quiche lorraine. There is nothing particularly interesting about quiche lorraine, yet it dominates the conversation. It is the quiche to which everyone defaults, out of habit and lack of imagination.Quiche deserves better. It is time for a rebrand, for people to recognise quiche as adaptable and exciting. We should be eating quiche all year round. Though French in origin, quiche has been welcomed with open arms into British cuisine. It is our answer to pizza and we should treat it with the same adoration that Naples treats its doughy son. Whisk together a few eggs with some cream, then pour into a pre-cooked pastry case and bake: you have made quiche in its base form – and a simple, economical midweek meal. But, like pizza, quiche is so much better when you make the pastry from scratch, then fill it with meat and vegetables and strong cheeses. There are infinite possibilities here are a few to get you started.Strictly speaking, a quiche is still a quiche if it doesn’t contain cheese, but there is no denying that they tend to be better with cheese. Gruyére and cheddar are the two classic quiche cheeses – they are versatile and inoffensive, so they work well with most other ingredients. But other cheeses are just as good when paired with the right partner: emmental and courgette, goat’s cheese and watercress and feta with spinach and tomato, for example.One of the quiche’s best qualities is that you can pack it with almost any vegetable and it will still work. Some combinations complement each other better than others. Mary Berry’s courgette and spinach quiche is a classic of the genre, but butternut squash works, too, as do mushrooms, cauliflower and asparagus – and even just the humble onion. For something a little less traditional, try Bon Appétit’s roasted vegetable tart, which uses red peppers, tomatoes, aubergine and sweet potato.Quiche lends itself well to all kinds of seafood: Ruby Tandoh’s herbed salmon and ricotta rendition is a great place to start (is there a more summery dish than salmon quiche?). Once you are ready to graduate from salmon, you could try smoked haddock, cod, crab, tuna or even scallops, if you are feeling flush.As you already know, sausages are versatile and work well cooked, chopped and buried inside a quiche. Keep it simple with a caramelised onion and sausage quiche, or try something more continental with this smoky chorizo and manchego take. Believe it or not, the hot dog quiche already exists.When it comes to meaty quiches, lorraine dominates the conversation, but there are alternatives. Quiche is a great way of using up leftover meat: chicken, pulled pork, black pudding, it all works. It goes without saying that ham is good too, but this is so close to quiche lorraine (which uses bacon or lardons) that you may as well just do that instead.Tomatoes generally work fine in a quiche, but cherry tomatoes, with their size and sweetness, are perfect for it and deserve their own section. Kim-Joy’s cherry tomato quiche is topped with one large tomato sporting a decorative sushi nori face. Anna Jones’s includes a medley of other vegetables.It is rare for cheese to get top billing when it comes to quiche, but not so for blue cheese quiches. Some recipes keep it simple and call for a generic blue cheese (see Oliver Rowe’s asparagus and blue cheese recipe). Others want something more specific (Ruby Tandoh’s broccoli and gorgonzola quiche). A friend swears to me that pear and roquefort quiches are also a thing.One of the few criticisms I will accept about quiche is that it is not the healthiest of meal choices. After all, it is mainly eggs and pastry (and cream and cheese and meat). There is a way around this, though – to have your quiche and eat it: make it without the pastry, like a frittata. There are plenty of recipes out there for crustless quiches, but, with the right ovenproof dish, there’s no reason why most wouldn’t also work without the base (although it may require a bit of experimentation to get the best results). You could also try alternatives to pastry, such as a sweet potato crust.Still not convinced? If you really, really can’t live without it, then Felicity Cloake has the recipe for the perfect quiche lorraine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7480d33d8d960fc3986410f16c60e4b7c9a6a075/0_406_1816_1089/master/1816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38be1aee7efb8fdc777032f26b390968","title":"honey pot how to brew mead at home","story":"Whether you harvest it non-alcoholic or leave it to become boozy over several months, home-brewed mead is a millennia-old traditionMead, which dates back to 5000 BC, is thought to be the world’s oldest fermented drink. There’s speculation it was discovered by accident in the hollow of a tree, where a little honey and some rainwater that had collected, stagnated and fermented spontaneously.Mead is made from water and honey, and ferments thanks to the endogenous yeasts that occur naturally in honey. The taste is honeyed and lightly alcoholic – people often think of mead as a highly alcoholic drink, but it doesn’t have to be. It depends on the length of time it is left to ferment. Here are two of our favourite versions: a sweet, young, fizzy and non-alcoholic mead that’s like Ethiopian tej, and a drier, more alcoholic mead that requires a little longer to ferment.When making mead, choose artisan honey and be discerning about products made from a mixture of honey from different countries – read the label carefully.The water should be around 25°C, in order for the honey to dissolve more easily. Be careful your water isn’t too warm or high in chlorine since this could kill the natural yeasts in the honey.As with Ethiopian tej, you can add edible flowers to this drink at bottling stage. Try lavender, which goes very well with honey and gives the drink a Provençal flavour.700g unpasteurised, unheated honey1 litre bottled mineral water, filtered or decanted for 12 hours at room temperature before use1 × 1.8L–2L sterilised, sealable jar (without lid)1 long-handled stainless steel spoon1 clean piece breathable fabric such as cheesecloth or linen1 rubber band1 funnel2 × 750ml flip-top bottles1 × 1.5L demijohn (carboy) 1 bubbler airlock (if making a more alcoholic version, see “option 2” below)Pour the honey into the jar, add the water and stir with the spoon until dissolved. Cover the jar with the cloth and secure with the rubber band. Set aside to ferment in a warm, dark place.First fermentation4–6 daysStir the mixture every day until you start to see bubbles in it, which means that fermentation is under way. Keep tasting for the first six days, to get an idea of the drink’s flavours. When you notice a slight acidity developing, the drink is ready for harvesting.It’s important to stir the mixture well at first fermentation stage in order to oxygenate the mead. The success of this spontaneous fermentation depends in large part on how much oxygen is available to the yeasts, so that they can multiply and work their magic.Option 1: harvesting sweet, fizzy, non-alcoholic mead1 week Decant the drink into the flip-top bottles, being careful not to add the sediment. Set aside to ferment for one more week, releasing a little of the gas from the bottles every day.1–3 monthsAfter the first ferment, pour the drink (but not the sediment) into a demijohn. Insert the bubbler airlock and set aside to ferment in a dark place for 1–3 months, until the bubbler airlock stops releasing bubbles. The longer fermentation lasts, the more alcoholic your mead will be. Decant the mead into the flip-top bottles, avoiding adding the sediment as before.If you’re making a more alcoholic version, once your mead has been fermenting in the demijohn for a couple of months, it is highly likely that the yeasts inside will have used up all of the fermentable sugars. Try adding a teaspoon of sugar at bottling stage in order to get fermentation going again to guarantee a nice, fizzy result.Set aside to ferment in the bottles for 1–2 weeks if you want the mead to be fizzy.How will I know if it hasn’t worked?If there are no bubbles.When is it ready to drink?When it has bubbles and a slightly sweet, not too sour flavour (this will vary according to the fermenting time).This is an edited extract from Kombucha, Kefir and Natural Sodas by Nina Lausecker and Sebastian Landaeus, published by Smith Street Books, AU$ 29.99."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f7e920b127366f18089a49c639f0bcb3b7300f1/0_297_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d9bebd00fddcea5124ba790955e95d6","title":"uk hot weather and social distancing in pictures","story":"As lockdown restrictions in England were relaxed and temperatures climbed to 28.2C, people headed for beaches and parks, leading to concerns about social distancing.

Doja Cat, Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello, Cardi B, Kehlani, Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé – almost all women of colour – “have had number ones with songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating etc”, Del Rey wrote. “Can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money, or whatever I want – without being crucified or saying that I’m glamorising abuse?“Anyways,” she wrote after several more paragraphs of bile further directed at the critics she says have accused her of glamorising abuse, “none of this has anything to do about much.” On the second page of her Instagram post of a text screenshot, she shrugged out the fact that she is releasing a new album and two books of poetry later this year. There it is. Female pop stars regularly criticise the media pitting them against one another to sell magazines and drive clicks. It’s depressing to see a critically acclaimed musician exploit that dynamic, mobilising those artists’ noisy fanbases for publicity.It’s especially depressing that Del Rey targeted women of colour, in doing so undermining a legitimate argument about contemporary culture’s restrictive insistence on female #empowerment to the exclusion of messier experiences. It is hard to avoid the suggestion, from an artist who has heavily used black culture in her work, that these performers’ sexualised images are more damaging for feminism than her lyrics about violence and bad boys. The malignant characterisation of black women as oversexualised is a historic racist trope – and a persistent one that has seen those performers subject to far greater media derision than Del Rey will ever experience.There’s no shortage of things that bind them. “I’m not not a feminist,” Del Rey wrote. “But there has to be a place in feminism for women who look and act like me – the kind of woman who says no but men hear yes – the kind of women who are slated mercilessly for being their authentic, delicate selves, the kind of women who get their own stories and voices taken away from them by stronger women or by men who hate women.” Almost all of the artists that Del Rey names share those experiences. As one Beyoncé fan tweeted, she was threatened after calling out police brutality – not to mention that she wrote Lemonade, a generational opus on her conflict over whether to stay with her husband after he cheated. Grande received death threats following the fatal overdose of an ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller. Kehlani has been subject to routine abuse over her former relationships. You could continue (and note the emphasis on white fragility implied by “delicate”). “All the women Lana mentioned have been through hell,” the fan said.I understand Del Rey’s resistance to the kind of pop feminism that considers her sometimes submissive and passive stance in the face of difficult men to be a betrayal of the cause: it isn’t productive and, as she states, the dynamics that underpin her songs are the reality for many women. Being on the receiving end of that commentary, and subject to those painful relationships, must have left her feeling incredibly alienated, especially as she publicly evolved in a culture that interprets women changing their mind as “proof” of their inauthenticity. In 2017, she said she would no longer sing “he hit me and it felt like a kiss” from her song Ultraviolence. “I don’t feel comfortable with that lyric any more,” she said. “Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more.” But her concept of feminist solidarity, who owes it and who is owed it, feels off. Her perplexing comments about her peers of colour are as kneejerk and reductive as the characterisation of her submissive lyrics as anti-feminist.Beyond this being an unparalleled example of lockdown cabin fever, it’s an odd time for Del Rey to make these complaints. For one, there’s people that are dying. We’re also years on from her early albums being mocked by critics for their sometimes flimsy affectations. By the time she released last year’s Norman Fucking Rockwell!, she was feted not only as one of the 21st century’s greatest artists, but a peer to Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan. The album ran away with the critics’ year-end polls (including ours), and was subject to lavishly attentive reviews. Yet still, she raked NPR’s Ann Powers over the coals for her assertion, in a thoughtful career retrospective, that Del Rey had used persona in her work. It suggests a raw nerve that might not be soothed by public recriminations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e4627447f3152b3a1f64d2eea5563eb863cff9/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292598d450c3dedc4a233bd98e20b8e0","title":"how coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels","story":"Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales.

We see Armstrong’s stepfather, Terry Armstrong, claim: “Lance would not be the champion he is today without me, because I drove him. I drove him like an animal.” (“He beat the shit out of me,” Lance recalls.) We hear Armstrong explaining how he forged his birth certificate to pass himself off as a 16-year-old and enter his first triathlon, rationalising the deception with cool command: “Forge the certificate, compete illegally, and beat everybody.” We watch as cycling contemporary Bobby Julich recalls how, at the end of his first head-to-head race against Armstrong, when they were both still teenagers, Armstrong yelled at him: “Come on you fucking pussy, let’s keep going – I’m not done yet.”The casual violence, the callous disregard for rules and the feelings of others: Armstrong did not come to any of these late in life, once his course as a professional cyclist was set. He was practically marinating in insensitivity from the womb. Born into a rotten system, Armstrong stayed rotten. What emerges at the end of these four hours is the story not so much of a single bad apple as a profoundly bad batch – a comprehensive, cradle-to-gallows account of the downfall of an elite athlete performing exactly in line with his surrounding incentives. Amid the brutality, competition, and insecurity of life in post-Reagan America, is it any wonder a man like Lance Armstrong was able to lie, cheat and bully his way to the top? The problem is not this man in particular, Zenovich seems to invite us to conclude, as men in general: their incurable ambition and violence, the fragility of their morals.This structural explanation for Armstrong’s wrongdoing sounds exculpatory, and to a degree it is. It is certainly one that Armstrong himself appears eager to embrace. Zenovich sat for eight interviews with Armstrong, between March 2018 and August 2019, and it is those conversations that form the core of Lance, which takes in the full sweep of the Armstrong saga, from his childhood and breakthrough world cycling championship at the age of 21, to cancer, his first experiences with cortisone and growth hormones, the seven consecutive Tour de France victories, his belligerence in the face of doping allegations, and the final unravelling of his career, from 2010 to 2013, as the full extent of his drug use finally came to light. Zenovich says Armstrong set no ground rules for their discussions (“Nothing is off limits,” he told her) but she cannot identify, even after two years of work on Lance, exactly what his motivation for participating in the documentary was. Was it an exercise in image rehabilitation? An attempt, in the cliched language of sporting redemption, to “tell his story”? “I don’t really know,” says Zenovich. “But I came to it with an open heart. I tried to straddle the good and the bad.”In Lance we see Armstrong combative, defensive, distracted and restless, the coiled fury that propelled him – back arched, eyes dead-ahead, through all those time trials and mountain stages – still very much visible. What we do not see much of is remorse or self-reflection. Armstrong’s preferred pronouns throughout the documentary are “you” and “we” – “I” does not get much of a workout. “The only way you can dope and be honest is if nobody ever asks you, which is not realistic. The second somebody asks you, you lie. We all lied.”Doping, Armstrong maintains, “was just ingrained in the sport, right up until the time that I got there from Plano, Texas”. His basic thesis is that he was a blameless naif, thrust into the maw of an evil sport. Here he is, for instance, on the development of EPO and his own turn to doping, under the tutelage of the notorious drug doctor Michele Ferrari, from the mid-1990s: “The performance benefits were so great. The sport went from low octane doping, which had always existed, to this high octane rocket fuel. So that was the decision we had to make.”Cheating, in other words, was the work of a collective, which makes it easy to resist personal responsibility – as Armstrong clearly still does. Derek Bouchard-Hall, the former CEO of USA Cycling and a contemporary of Armstrong, tells Zenovich that “there were no morals and ethics” around doping in the 1990s, that people “were still figuring things out, and we forget that now” – as if the history of drug use at the Olympics, anabolic steroids, Ben Johnson and all the rest had somehow passed the world of cycling by. This is, of course, an assertion as ludicrous as it is unbelievable – but it offers an insight into the intensity of the delusion that pervaded the sport that Armstrong came to dominate.Armstrong reveals himself, throughout Lance, to be a master at evading the question – at reframing it, redefining it, and stacking it with caveats in order to cast himself in a better light. It’s Not About the Bike, his 2000 autobiography, he tells Zenovich with a completely straight face, was unfairly picked apart, because “everything in that book was true, except for when I address doping”. The accusation that he used Livestrong, his cancer foundation, as a “shield” to protect himself from doping allegations is “unfair”, he maintains – “though I used cancer occasionally as a shield”.Despite the pantomime of self-examination that Armstrong performs, reluctantly, throughout Lance, what comes across most convincingly is his lack of regret. “I wouldn’t change a thing,” he tells Zenovich – and it seems true that for Armstrong the most critical injunction of living is still, as he says repeatedly, to “get your hate on”.The scale of Armstrong’s remorselessness can be grasped in the intensity of the venom and contempt he maintains for many of his contemporaries. Former competitors who now greet each other warmly, he says, are “wimps”. Floyd Landis, the former teammate whose testimony provided the impetus for the US Anti-Doping Agency investigation that eventually brought Armstrong down, is dismissed as a “piece of shit”. Armstrong describes Julich, in virtually the same breath, as both a “friend” and a “whiner”. Ironically it’s left to Landis himself to offer the most telling appraisal of Armstrong’s character. Reflecting on his own attempts to deflect doping allegations after he failed drug tests in the wake of his 2006 Tour victory, Landis says: “It’s hard lying to people, I’m not very good at it. Lance is very very good at it … He’s very uncomfortable being himself.”The documentary’s only real moment of vulnerability comes when Armstrong reflects on his friendship with Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour winner who spent the early 2000s in second place on the final-day podium in Paris, before succumbing to his own drug-borne fall from grace the year after Armstrong retired. In 2018 Armstrong travelled to Germany to visit Ullrich, who’d just been released from the psychiatric hospital to which he’d been admitted after a series of assault charges. Zenovich asks why he went to see Ullrich. “The reason I went to see him is I love him,” Armstrong replies, before breaking down in tears. “It was not a good trip. He was the most important person in my life.”Within moments, however, that vulnerability is gone and Armstrong has re-armored himself in a carapace of sneers. A rant about how Ivan Basso, Erik Zabel and George Hincapie are household names in Italy, Germany and the US – are they? – while Marco Pantani, Ullrich and Armstrong are dead or disgraced follows, and then it becomes clear: this moment of emotional authenticity is really an exercise in self-pity. If me, Armstrong seems to say, why not them as well?Coming as it does on the heels of The Last Dance’s uncomplicated celebration of success and competition, Lance offers a welcome study in the corruption of the male athletic ego. The line between Michael Jordan – brash, insensitive, gifted, wildly successful – and Lance Armstrong – brash, insensitive, gifted, wildly successful, and a drug cheat – is syringe-thin. If Lance, like its subject’s career, proves the ease with which that line can be crossed, the road to self-recognition, for Armstrong at least, appears far more demanding. In the opening minutes of the documentary, Armstrong recounts a scene at a restaurant, shortly after his exposure as a drug cheat, at which he was assailed by a crowd of angry patrons yelling, “Fuck you!” Armstrong comments with a shrug: “Some people just can’t chill the fuck out. They’re pissed still, and they’ll be pissed forever.” What is obvious is that Armstrong himself, even after years to reflect on his misdeeds and manipulations, still cannot see that he is exactly the same: an angry man, who will probably never be quite himself without his rage.Part one of Lance premieres in the US on 25 May, with part two showing on 1 June. It can be viewed on ESPN in in the US, and ESPN’s streaming platformin the rest of the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/739c0561c7efc2372acba4293849a5de6eb14883/0_313_5282_3171/master/5282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c01324ab88c76c99ced925df0ad07f43","title":"facebook coronavirus remote working policy extended years","story":"Mark Zuckerberg says company will embrace permanent remote work after lockdowns liftFacebook will permanently embrace remote work, even after coronavirus lockdowns ease, Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday, accelerating the tech sector’s geographic ersification away from its home in Silicon Valley.The CEO said the world’s largest social network would start “aggressively opening up remote hiring”, expecting that about half its workforce would work remotely over the next five to 10 years.“We’re going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale,” Zuckerberg said in an interview with the Verge.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years – maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range – I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.”The company would take a more “measured approach” with existing employees based on job function and performance, he said, and set a 1 January 2021 deadline for staff to update the company on their new locations.Facebook, with its more than 48,000 employees working in 70 offices across the globe, is so far the largest tech company to embrace long-term or permanent remote work in response to coronavirus pandemic.Earlier this month, Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, announced that employees would be able to work from home “forever”. A week later, he extended the same offer to employees at Square, making Twitter and Square the first major tech companies to permit remote work indefinitely. Amazon extended its work-from-home policy until at least early October.Facebook said it would move forward with plans to hire 10,000 engineers and product employees this year and would build three new “hubs” in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver where remote workers in those areas could occasionally meet.“These aren’t necessarily offices,” Zuckerberg said, although the company would probably create “some kind of physical space” to accompany them. “The idea for these hubs is that we want to create scale. We want to focus the recruiting energy in some cities where we can get to hundreds of engineers.“He predicted some cost savings related to real estate, food and labor costs, as sky-high compensation packages common in Silicon Valley would be adjusted if Facebook employees opted to live in less-pricey regions.But the overall effect on costs was unclear, Zuckerberg said savings could be offset by additional costs related to travel and technologies associated with setting up home offices.The shift has the potential to change the complexion of Silicon Valley. Until recently, the company offered new hires up to $15,000 if they agreed to move within 10 miles of the company’s flagship campus in Menlo Park, with some of the most expensive real estate in the country.A permanent work-from-home policy could encourage more employees to live in more affordable locations outside the high-priced Bay Area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

The idea started in the US, where the three-Michelin-starred Inn at Little Washington in Virginia is working with a local design company and a theatre to create elegantly dressed “dining mannequins” to fill the spaces between real-life guests. The Open Hearth restaurant in Taylors, South Carolina, chose a budget version: blow-up dolls ordered from Amazon. The idea has since spread to Europe. In Austria, several Viennese bars and cafes have installed mannequins, including historic Café Central and cocktail bar Kleinod Prunkstück. Mannequins used in various restaurants in Vilnius, Lithuania, have a dual purpose: as well as filling tables, they also showcase fashions by local designers. Australia has a different spin on the idea: Five Dock Dining in Sydney has seats filled with cardboard cutouts of people, and is playing guest chatter over the speakers instead of music.Café Rothe in Schwerin, northern Germany, has been issuing patrons with hats topped with  three foam pool noodles in a T-shape – each float is 1.5 metres long, to ensure no one gets too close. Similar hats, made from balloons, have been spotted on visitors to Shiniuzhai national geological park in China’s Hunan province.Technology that alerts the wearer if others get too close is being developed to help people return to work safely. Gadgets range from hard hats for construction workers – that buzz if someone comes too near – to beeping bracelets for factory workers. Such devices will also be useful in restaurants and at tourist attractions – the Duomo in Florence is giving visitors sensors to wear around their necks that beep softly, vibrate and flash when two people come within less than two metres of each other. Beaches in Spain are installing sensors on lampposts to monitor the number of people on a particular stretch visitors can check an app to find quieter spots.The restaurant at Mediamatic, an arts centre in Amsterdam, is trialling five mini canalside greenhouses. Inside each is a table for two, at which people from the same household can dine, served by staff wearing face shields. The food is delivered on long wooden planks so waiters don’t have to enter the greenhouse. The idea has inspired the owner of a pub in another watery location: the Norfolk Broads. The Lion at Thurne will have three greenhouses, each seating six, ready and waiting when pubs reopen in England.And finally … Fish Tales restaurant in Maryland has introduced “bumper tables”. Inidual diners stand inside the circular tables, which are edged with giant inner tubes. The tables are on wheels, so customers can mingle without getting too close. Well, it’s more fun than eating behind a shower curtain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214f8025a165c4b4ee1d63360cccd2a60a14bce2/0_0_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10172ae2482d8c1973bf50c0fabfb065","title":"what is it like to live on uk borders during lockdown","story":"We’d like to hear from people who live on the border of two nations with different lockdown guidanceAfter Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refused to adopt the British government’s new “stay alert” slogan, instead opting to continue the original advice to “stay home”, the four nations’ approaches to coronavirus has begun to fracture.For those living on the UK’s borders, this ision has left them grappling with conflicting guidelines.

But churches are still banned, along with hair salons and sporting events. Newsom said on Monday churches could reopen in weeks, not months.But many churches are tired of waiting. A lawyer representing a church in Lodi that has sued Newsom said more than 1,200 pastors have signed a “declaration of essentiality” that announces their plan to reopen on 31 May while observing physical distancing and other precautions.Attorney Robert Tyler said some pastors represent multiple churches. He expects as many as 3,000 churches across California could have in-person services on 31 May.“This letter was not sent for the purposes of asking for permission,” he said.The letter comes one day after the head of the US justice department’s civil rights ision told Newsom in a letter that his stay-at-home order discriminates against churches and places an “unfair burden” on them.Representatives from Newsom’s office and the California department of public health did not respond to a request for comment.California has more than 85,700 coronavirus cases and more than 3,400 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The number of people infected is probably higher because of a lack of testing.California was the first state to issue a mandatory stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Nearly all of the state’s churches complied with the order, with most holding services online for people to worship in their homes.But that’s been a problem for the Temple Ner Simcha synagogue in Westlake Village. Rabbi Michael Barclay has been streaming his services, but he says some of his congregants are Orthodox Jews and cannot use electricity on the Sabbath.“It’s been extremely difficult to stay in contact with people, especially to deal with people and their psychological, emotional and spiritual needs,” said Barclay, who signed the letter and plans to resume services on 31 May. “It really has hurt the psyche and the spirit of people.”Barclay said his 300-seat sanctuary has enough room for about 40 families to practice physical distancing “without a problem”.The Cross Culture Christian Center in Lodi was one of the few churches that tried to keep meeting despite the stay-at-home order. Local police entered the church during a service in March to tell them they were violating the governor’s order. The church’s landlord later changed the locks, and police threatened to cite anyone who entered the property.The church sued. A federal judge earlier this month sided with Newsom, saying he had the right to ban church services in the interest of public health. Tyler said the church had appealed against the ruling.Earlier this month, a federal judge in Kentucky ruled overturned Governor Andy Beshear’s temporary ban of religious services, saying he did not give a “compelling reason” to limit people’s right to freely practice religion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Since mid-March, the World Health Organization has urged countries to scale up the testing, isolation and contact tracing of Covid-19 patients in order to combat the pandemic. Countries that initiated test and trace regimes early – including Germany, South Korea, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Canada – have fared better than those that did not.One of the most striking success stories has been South Korea, which started its regime several weeks before the WHO’s “test, test, test” appeal in March. The country was quickly able to test an average of 12,000 people a day – and sometimes as many as 20,000 – at hundreds of drive-through and walk-in testing centres, free of charge. Results were sent to people’s phones within 24 hours.As some commentators have remarked, South Korea’s regime was built on the base of well-funded public services and an effective infrastructure, including widespread digital surveillance.Germany has emerged as another effective model. The country has carried out a rigorous test and trace programme since the first case of the virus was registered in late January. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the government’s main advisory body on public health, has repeatedly referred to the programme as a basic epidemiological tool necessary for the virus’s containment.The system was hampered by a lack of staff at the overstretched local health authority offices responsible for enacting it, but over the weeks hundreds of containment scouts – often medical students - have been trained by the RKI to help out. About 500 of them are operational around the country.Typically when a new infection is registered, a hygiene inspector at the health office asks the infected person the following questions: how long have they had symptoms, where might they have been infected, have they been at work, with whom have they been in touch and in what way, and are school or nursery age children in the household?Contacts are questioned and put into different categories by a team of at least a dozen staff, including doctors and containment scouts, and then quarantined. Contacts are not automatically tested, in order to avoid a negative result that could trigger a false sense of security,Canada, with its experience of being the only country outside Asia to have deaths in the Sars outbreak of 2003, was also quick to conduct tests and contact tracing. As of mid-May more than a million people had been tested for Covid-19, using a centralised network of laboratories.Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is among those to express scepticism about the framing of the UK’s test and trace programme as “world-beating”.“World-beating, at the start of an outbreak, would been to have had a system large enough to be able to cope with number of tests needed,” Whitworth said. “Not just sending them out but doing them and reporting back so that you can take action and having the contact tracing to be able to identify people who might be incubating the disease.Whitworth also said countries that have been successful have deployed large amounts of human resources quickly and effectively, such as Germany’s “contact scouts” and South Korea’s rapid-reporting system.“The human element is central. If you have a web-based system or an app those are things that add value but they don’t replace the human capital. They are good when tracing becomes difficult like if a confirmed case has got on a bus. That’s where an app can identify potential contacts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6362360ef515a74fe556ff4fba5e6924576ebab4/0_169_3379_2028/master/3379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96f2ffb7c686eb0a3ab2dead7264bf1a","title":"nicola sturgeon eases coronavirus lockdown rules in scotland","story":"Sunbathing, meeting friends and some sports allowed from 28 May – and schools to reopen in AugustNicola Sturgeon has announced people in Scotland will be allowed to meet friends outdoors, sunbathe and start shopping at garden centres from 28 May as she unveiled the slow easing of the lockdown.The first minister told MSPs she wanted to see a suitably cautious lifting of some lockdown restrictions from next Thursday mirroring the relaxations already announced in other parts of the UK.Sturgeon confirmed outdoor sports such as tennis and golf could restart next week and people could visit nearby parks and beauty spots. Outdoor cafes, recycling centres and drive-through restaurants will also be permitted to reopen as part of the four-step plan she outlined for easing the lockdown.She said all Scotland’s schools would reopen from 11 August with a “blended model” of part-time teaching in school and at home, with teachers going back to school from June to start preparing their classrooms.From June, children moving from primary school to secondary school this summer would also be given help with the transition to secondary school. She added, however, that tight restrictions on allowing relatives and friends to gather at funerals, and the ban on bars and hairdressers from reopening, would not be relaxed for at least three weeks.“The steps we will take are by necessity gradual and incremental – and they must also be matched with rigorous, ongoing monitoring of the virus,” Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..She warned that the lockdown could be reimposed if the virus returned, and urged people in Scotland to continue observing all existing restrictions until the first relaxation began next Thursday.Scotland is the last of the four parts of the UK to publish specific plans on easing the lockdown the prime minister, Boris Johnson, did so on 10 May, with Wales and Northern Ireland already allowing outdoor sports, recycling centres and garden centres to restart.The latest Scottish data on deaths in hospitals, intensive care cases and hospital admissions confirmed the gradual decline in the severity of the outbreak. While the number of deaths with confirmed Covid-19 climbed by 37 to 2,221, the number in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 fell by 125 to 1,318.• Non-essential indoor shops, pubs and restaurants must remain closed for at least three weeks, with no date yet set for their reopening.• The building trade would be allowed to slowly resume construction.• Childminders could slowly resume work from next week, and all nurseries would resume slowly this summer.• Universities in Scotland would reopen in September by combining remote learning with limited on-campus tuition.Opposition parties broadly welcomed the phased approach but Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tory leader, said Sturgeon’s statement raised a series of questions about how it would work in practice. “Scotland is already on the move,” he said.He urged Sturgeon to publish sector by sector plans and the clearest possible instructions on what was allowed. As the changes became more nuanced “so the need for clarity will be more urgent than ever”, he said.Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, urged Sturgeon to publish all the evidence and advice she was using to make the decisions, to introduce an emergency plan for care homes, and maximise the test, trace and isolate programme she promised would start in late May.Alison Johnstone, the co-leader of the Scottish Greens, said the Scottish government should have introduced a mass test, trace and isolate programme at an earlier stage. Many people were already ignoring the lockdown advice. The police were called to disperse crowds of sunbathers at Portobello beach in Edinburgh on Wednesday, she said.Downing Street claimed Scotland’s announcement was a vindication of Johnson’s plan for lifting the lockdown – despite clashes over the prime minister’s abandonment of the “stay at home” slogan.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We welcome today’s announcement as it shows the UK-wide approach is working. We set out the roadmap a few weeks ago and now the devolved administrations are following that path at the right speed for them.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258635.1590088703!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert plan in doubt as teachers union tells members not to co operate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe new calculated grades system is being set up following the cancellation of Leaving Cert exams on public health grounds due to Covid-19. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillPlans to award thousands of Leaving Cert students predicted grades have been thrown into doubt after the country’s biggest secondary teachers’union directed members not to engage with the process.The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) said plans to indemnify teachers against legal action were not strong enough and could potentially lead to personal liabilities for second level teachers.“This position is unacceptable,” the union said, in a statement. “We will continue to engage with the Department of Education and Skills to secure the necessary provisions.“In the meantime, we are advising ASTI members not to undertake any work on the process until this issue is resolved.”The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) said, however, it was satisfied with the legal protections offered to teachers.A spokesman for the department said it had provided additional clarification over the indemnity and was continuing to engage with the union.“Minister McHugh recognises the importance of teachers carrying out work in relation to calculated grades on behalf of the department which is why he sought approval from Government to put a State indemnity scheme in place.Under department guidelines, the State indemnity will be provided to teachers if they end up being sued as an inidual teacher in relation to a student’s grades.This indemnity - signed off by the Cabinet on Thursday - will only be invoked where a teacher has “made every reasonable effort” to apply a grade in line with the department’s official guidelines for schools which was published on Thursday evening.  Government sources say the indemnity is of a\u0026nbspsimilar standard\u0026nbspto that provided to civil servants or members of the judiciary for administrative roles.The guidance also states that schools will be required to report any inappropriate canvassing over students’ estimated Leaving Cert grades to the Department of Education.Students will have access to an online portal from early next week where they will be require to confirm if they wish to receive a calculated grade and the relevant level for a subject, such as higher, ordinary or foundation.It contains advice on what information teachers should use to inform the school’s judgements about estimated marks.There is also detailed guidance on how teachers can work together to ensure alignment of marks across students and classes in schools. This process will be over overseen by principals.The rules around canvassing also set out how schools will be required to report instances of inappropriate contact to the department.Following the Government decision earlier this month to cancel the summer Leaving Cert exams, more than 60,000 students are set to receive calculated grades for the first time based on teachers’ estimates.Under this approach, teachers will be asked to provide an estimated percentage mark for each student for each subject. Students will also be placed in a rank for their class.The guidance will state that teachers should draw on “existing records and available evidence” such as classwork, homework, class assessments, Christmas and summer exams and mock exams. Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions.In order to determine where students rank inidually in a class, each student may be marked out of 1,000 and these scores will then be converted to percentages.These grades will then be sent to the department where a unit will compare information on how students in the school have fared in particular subjects in the Leaving Cert over the past three years compared to the national standard.Sources said teachers would be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members under official guidance to be issued shortly.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.In cases where students who are studying a subject outside a recognised school, Minister for Education Joe McHugh has signalled that these students will be examined on a case-by-case basis.A total of 2,858 external candidates are entered to sit the Leaving Cert this year, many of whom are studying in an alternative setting such as a private college.For students in receipt of home tuition with an association to a recognised school, the guidance will provide information for school authorities to engage with the home tutor in arriving at a decision.Whether a valid estimate of performance can be provided will depend on whether the home tutor is a registered teacher and where the school is satisfied with the evidence used to support the judgment.In cases where a student has moved school recently and the length of time is such that the teacher considers that they do not have enough evidence to make a sound judgement, the guidance will state that the teacher should consult school management about acquiring additional information from the student’s previous school."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259068.1590059049!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary schools unlikely to reopen in june as union sees mammoth task in september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe National Public Health Emergency Team has said it does not see schools returning before September.  File photograph: Dave ThompsonPA Wire.It is unlikely that primary schools will reopen in June, the general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) John Boyle has said.Getting children back to school in September will be a “mammoth planning task” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. With 20 school days to go before the summer break it would be very difficult for schools to reopen, even on a phased basis. Mr Boyle warned that it may not be possible for all children to return at the same time in September as there will be logistical issues particularly in rural Ireland where many children travel to school by bus.Also speaking on Thursday, Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory and member of the National Public Health Emergency Team said at the moment NPHET feels “the prudent thing to do is to leave schools closed.”Speaking on the Today with Sarah McInerney Show, Mr de Gascun said there is not yet enough evidence to suggest that children pose no risk of passing on the coronavirus.However, he said a number of countries have brought schools back in recent weeks and NPHET will be “watching what’s happening in those settings over the next two to three weeks and that will inform our decision”.“We will continue to keep that under review, but we are aware how difficult it is for children not being in school, not having access to their friends, not having that sort of social interaction, so we do know how difficult that is,” Mr De Gascun said.The INTO’s Mr Boyle said children with complex educational needs will be provided for through summer programmes.The INTO has been engaging with stakeholders to prepare for the return of children to school, and to see if it would be possible for all children to return at the same time. The teachers’ union is “certainly up for that challenge,” he added.The deaths of another 11 patients with Covid-19 were reported by NPHET on Wednesday. There have now been a total of 1,571 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic.A total of 64 new laboratory confirmed cases of the disease was reported by NPHET at its daily briefing, bringing the total number of cases to 24,315. This is the fifth day in a row in which the daily case number has remained below 100.Meanwhile, Minister for Education Joe McHugh said massive logistical work is required in order to reopen schools in time for September.Mr McHugh said it was clear that a “one size fits all” approach will not apply because of the ersity of school and education settings.Áine Lynch, chief executive of the National Parents’ Council Primary, said a decision to keep schools closed until September was made at a time when public health conditions were worse than they are now.The World Health Organisation (WHO) special envoy on Covid-19 also said it is was time to think about reopening schools in Ireland.Mr McHugh, however, said opening schools needs to be “carefully managed” and planning is under way for the reopening of educational institutions from the beginning of September, in consultation with stakeholders and with regard to the experience of other countries.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Davis College pupils in Mallow, Co Cork, scoop top prize for work on plastic pollutionStrong backing for more ambition to address carbon emissions, according to pollDublin, Louth, Limerick, Clare and Galway properties most vulnerable, analysis finds"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259641.1590091041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin car restrictions and bus diversions part of covid 19 strategy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBus-users are likely to see the biggest change, with buses erted away from College Green. Large-scale bus ersions, restrictions on cars and a widespread reallocation of road space to pedestrians and cyclists are planned under a new Covid-19 strategy for Dublin city centre.A joint National Transport Authority (NTA) and Dublin City Council Covid-19 “mobility intervention programme” seeks to turn the heart of Dublin city from St Stephen’s Green to Mountjoy Square, and the Custom House to Stoneybatter into a “pedestrian, cyclist, public transport priority zone”.However, this will necessitate significant changes to the bus network, as well as the opening of off-street car parks on the outskirts of the city.Once activity returns to the city, bicycle-use is expected to triple and walking to double.Car-use is expected to fall by 30 per cent, but public transport is due to take a far bigger hit, with usage down by 80 per cent, largely due to social distancing requirements.The mobility programme identifies 14 key routes into the city centre where significant traffic changes will be implemented, in addition to the creation of the city centre priority zone.On all routes more space will be given to cyclists and pedestrians. In many cases this will involve the removal of on-street parking and reduction of the number of traffic lanes. In some cases it may involve “car-free” areas and the use of “bus gates” in places such as the Rathmines Road.AlternativesThe report concedes “more people will wish to travel by car”. However, it said while city centre car parks could remain open, alternatives to driving directly into the “core” were needed. This could include the establishment of car parks on the periphery from where people could walk or cycle.In some cases streets could be car-free if businesses on the street were to request it to use the space for queueing and tables.Bus-users are likely to see the biggest change, with buses erted away from College Green.Bus stops will also be distributed over a wider area, with some “removed completely” if social distancing cannot be achieved.“It is likely that passengers will be required, in some instances, to walk further to bus stops to ensure a safer spread of bus loading unloading.”The “emphasis is on rapid and temporary types of intervention”, with additions and adjustments expected over the coming months as measures are implemented."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study findsFifty brain teasers on all things natural from sealife to flora and what tofu is made of"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Prof Nolan, who chairs the epidemiological modelling advisory group of the National Public Health Advisory Team (NPHET), said his view is informed by studies done on testing in populations. “For every hundred people out there, there’s at least 95 who have never been exposed to this virus,” he said. “If we start to transmit it because of the way we act, there is no protection against the virus.”He was speaking as the NPHET published new figures showing another 12 people with Covid-19 had died in the State, bringing the total to 1,583. Another 76 cases were confirmed, with a total of 24,391 people now diagnosed with the disease. Reproduction numberProf Nolan said that efforts to suppress the disease had largely been successful, with the Reproduction number estimated to be between 0.45 and 0.63. This is a mathematical estimate of how many people an infected person will pass the virus onto.“Indicators of the disease are very good, with all major indicators either declining or stable,” Prof Nolan said. However, he warned that an increase in the R number would see a rapid escalation of cases. If it were to rise to 1.2, between 400 and 600 cases would be likely by early July, whereas an increase to 1.8 would likely see 800 per day towards the end of this month and into early June. He said the average number of new cases per day had fallen from 559 on April 16th to 72 on Thursday, while the numbers in hospital, averaged over the previous five days, had fallen from 865 to 380. Admissions to hospital followed a similar pattern, falling from 54 to 18 on average over the same period.Asked about comments by the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, that some measures could be fast tracked if the data supported such a decision, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said such a move was possible but added: “I’m not seeing anything in particular that would lead me to believe that we would markedly change from the general direction of that roadmap.”He said if people stop adhering to public health advice, “there is always a risk that things could go in the opposite direction . . . it is very important people do not become complacent. The R number is very finely balanced at any point in time. It would not take much at all to go from 0.5 to 1.5 and have us right back where we were two weeks ago.”Children and parentsDr Glynn said NPHET would on Friday discuss measures to help children and parents, but would not be drawn on the detail of the schemes. He said the team would also examine the potential to change testing strategies, including potential new approaches to nursing homes, healthcare workers and other vulnerable groups. Asked about the application of two-hour limits to contact between people, Dr Glynn said there is “no rule that says you cannot be in a room for two hours with somebody else”. He said two hours in the same room as a confirmed case is the point at which public health doctors determine someone to be a close contact of that case, and advise them to self-isolate. He urged businesses and bodies like the Oireachtas and the Courts Service to plan accordingly so that positive cases do not have a significant impact on their capacity to carry out their functions due to self-isolation.Dr Glynn said there were no additional clusters in nursing homes to report, and only five new cases in nursing homes across the country.The last 24 hours has seen 15 new admissions to hospital and two new admissions to ICU, Dr Glynn said. He said 862 deaths are associated with residents of nursing homes. Some 7,660 cases have been diagnosed in healthcare workers, and seven people working in healthcare have died.Nurses accounted for 31.7 per cent of cases, and doctors accounted for 5.9 per cent, with other healthcare workers and porters and other professionals making up the remainder."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"President praises Cuba\u0026rsquos response to Covid-19 and backs push for \u0026lsquouniversal basic services\u0026rsquoPlan for deficit reduction will be required once growth returns, says Leo VaradkarPeacekeepers\u0026rsquo weapons an obstacle to repatriation efforts from Goma region of DRCCabinet considering new Covid-19 measures to ensure tavellers self-isolate for 14 daysFF, FG and Greens discuss details of coalition with focus on climate change policiesReports suggest driver of the car failed to stop and was driving at an officer in MallowCoronavirus death toll in the North tops 500 after seven more fatalities from virusGreg Bemis (91) died at his home a year after signing over ownership of WW1 ship wreckInvestigation under way after incident involving air ambulance returning to baseCity council, NTA want centre to be \u0027pedestrian, cyclist, public transport priority zone\u0027A further 12 people have died from virus and 76 new cases have been detectedASTI says proposal to indemnify teachers against legal action is not strong enoughD\u0026aacuteil group\u0026rsquos chairman criticises access to fast food, but lack of access to cancer screeningHouse in Finglas, Dublin had been the subject of Criminal Assets Bureau actionLabour leader Alan Kelly says it as \u0026lsquofrankly bonkers\u0026rsquo politicians were unaware of advice about Oireachtas meetings of more than two hoursMotorcyclist dies on Naul Road, death brings to 57 number of fatalities on Irish roads in 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259338.1590068722!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"austerity must not return higgins tells communist paper","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t President Michael D Higgins warned against a return to austerity. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw  The President Michael D Higgins has used an interview with an Italian communist newspaper to warn against a return to austerity and praise the response of Cuba to the Covid-19 crisis. He also said the Irish response to the crisis “seems to be bearing fruit” but warned about “serious problems” if pandemic regulations in Northern Ireland were different to those in the State.Mr Higgins said it was a “huge disappointment” for him to “see discrimination on the basis of age in the responses to the crisis by so many countries, even though they are motivated by the best intentions”.The Irish Government is amongst those to have introduced special advice for the over 70s to protect themselves from the virus.The President’s interview was carried in an edition of Il Manifesto, described as the “communist daily” although it has no links to any political party. Its reporter spoke to Mr Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin.A report on the interview has been circulated among senior officials and Ministers in Dublin, where his views are said to have raised some eyebrows.Mr Higgins revisited a theme familiar from the last economic crisis when he warned against any return of austerity policies.“The price paid for austerity is a situation that must not come up again,” he said. “It is time for a paradigm shift, and this change must take place in the streets of Europe. “I am in favour of universal basic services with an income that allows people to live, rather than simply a universal basic income that a system prone to exploitation could abuse. Universal basic services and a universal basic income are not contradictory, provided that priority is given to the former.”Mr Higgins was critical of the early response of the EU to the crisis, saying it “revealed a lack of collective action, not to mention a lack of solidarity in the unedifying competition for protective equipment and clothing, and even test materials”.Collective responsibilityHe also said that the recent decision of the German Constitutional Court – which called into question Germany’s participation in ECB bond-buying – “ is a serious threat to the Euro zone and the European Union itself”.However, when the subject was raised with him, the President praised the response of Cuba, which sent doctors and equipment to Northern Italy to help efforts to tackle the virus there. “The behaviour to which Cuba has accustomed us in responding to situations of grave need is an example of the acceptance of a collective responsibility that offers the best hope for an adequate response also to issues of sustainability, and even climate change. By sustainability I mean a form of eco-social economy that implies a consensus on the universality of fundamental rights,” he said.He also criticised aspects of international sanctions against Cuba and Iran. “The inclusion of the medicines and materials necessary for the response to Covid-19 in the restrictions applied to Cuba and Iran is a clear violation of international law, which merits universal condemnation,” Mr Higgins said.Mr Higgins said that the “language used to describe the vulnerability of older people has been revealing”. “Where has a sociological perspective gone? Narrow-minded behavioural perspectives prevailed, while the value of phenomenological approaches to social gerontology was lost. My concern now, as a sociologist, is that we are retreating into a coldness of interpersonal relationships that it has taken us decades to get away from,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259652.1590093465!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"solar panel limit lifting key part of government formation talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan: Some Green sources say he has had  huge support since an issue around leadership arose. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Restrictions on the amount of solar panels which can be placed on the roofs of homes and businesses will be significantly eased under plans to increase energy efficiency being discussed in government formation talks.A two-hour session on climate change on Thursday mostly discussed energy and governance issues around the implementation of climate change policies.Reducing Ireland’s carbon emissions by an average of 7 per cent annually is the key policy goal of the Greens in coalition talks.Sources said the focus on Thursday was largely on renewable energy, such as how to achieve an ambition to go further than the current government pledge that 70 per cent of the State’s electricity supply will come from renewable sources by 2030.Other areas seen as key to achieving the 7 per cent reduction in carbon emissions, such as transport and agriculture, have not yet been the subject of detailed policy negotiations.It is understood that most of the proposals discussed on Thursday were regarding changes in regulations or legislation. It is expected a new Marine Bill will be a priority for a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Green Party government aimed at encouraging more offshore wind energy generation.Rooftop systemsThere was also an emphasis on how to encourage a greater use of solar energy in homes and businesses, and creating a mechanism for allowing people to sell energy back to the national grid.The Green Party general election manifesto committed to “removing the current limits of 50 per cent12sq m roof space for solar panels”.It said: “This will provide for 5 per cent of our electricity needs. It will be achieved by direct installation on public buildings and by changing building regulations to promote the installation of PV panels during any major renovation.”A national ban on the burning of smoky coal was also discussed on Thursday. This policy is favoured by the Greens and Fianna Fáil and was pursued by the Fine Gael-Independent minority government in the last Dáil but ran into legal difficulties.Leadership contestMeanwhile, Green Party senator Pauline O’Reilly has said the “promising” government formation talks calls into question why the Greens should change leader now.Party deputy leader Catherine Martin continued her work as the Greens’ lead negotiator in the talks a day after she said she was giving “serious consideration” to standing against Eamon Ryan for the position of leader.Ms Martin and Mr Ryan continued their work as usual on Thursday, according to party sources. Ms Martin has said, however, that any leadership contest in the Greens should wait until after the conclusion of the government formation talks.Ms O’Reilly said the Greens had seen a significant increase in their numbers of TDs, councillors and senators, adding that this was “not the time” for a change of leader.Some Green sources said Mr Ryan had received huge support since the leadership issue arose earlier this week and claimed some people had been making soundings across the party on behalf of Ms Martin in recent weeks.Green rules stipulate that a leadership contest must be held within six months of a general election. The election took place on February 8th.Green Party chair Hazel Chu, a councillor for the Pembroke Ward on Dublin City Council, said it was an “open contest”.“It is democratic organisation.

But it leaves these key questions unanswered:Where will the checks be?Under the agreement, Britain is in the strange position of having the responsibility of enforcing the edge of the EU’s single market. To do this, the UK government paper says “no new infrastructure” will be required.However, according to British sources, this does not exclude the expansion of existing facilities at Belfast Airport, Belfast Port, and Warrenpoint. Moreover, extra inspections may be added to the current checks on animals that take place at Larne Harbour. Britain is set to inform the EU of its plans for these facilities by June.Britain proposes that checks on industrial goods are not necessary at the sea border and can take place through spot checks in shops and warehouses by agents employed by the Northern Ireland Executive. But as such goods could be driven directly from ports into the Republic and into the single market, this would appear to be a wide-open opportunity for smuggling, and the EU side is unlikely to agree to it.What about goods from the rest of the world?From January, the tariffs Britain applies on goods it imports from around the world will erge from EU tariffs. According to its new global tariff schedule, published this week, Britain will drop tariffs to zero on a number of products.Take the example of copper alloy tubes. The EU charges a 5 per cent tariff on imports of these from third countries with which it does not have a preferential trade deal. Britain says it will charge zero. Therefore, from January 1st smugglers could avail of a 5 per cent profit margin on copper alloy tubes from China if they can order them into Britain and then move them through the North into the Republic.How does Britain intend to prevent this? Its paper states that goods entering Northern Ireland will need “new electronic import declaration requirements, and safety and security information”. But if there are no border checks, how can these be verified?How are Irish goods told apart from Northern Irish ones?Britain stresses in its paper that there will be “no change to how Northern Ireland goods arrive in Great Britain ports compared to today”. It assures there will be no checks, and even “no additional process or paperwork”.However, a British source confirmed that goods from the Republic will be subject to checks, and that Irish companies will have to file an export declaration when selling into Britain.So how are Northern Ireland goods to be told apart from the goods of the Republic? Officials could not answer how products could be distinguished without any process or paperwork taking place.This potentially opens a hole to goods from anywhere in the EU accessing Britain’s market. An inability to guarantee the source of goods could be an issue as Britain tries to strike trade deals with new countries. It also raises fears among Northern Ireland businesses that their unique access into both the EU and Britain might not be so unique after all, and that they could be undercut.The question is further complicated in the case of goods that have components from both the Republic and Northern Ireland. To give one example, Baileys Irish Cream is a cross-Border hybrid. How would it be determined which part of the island goods originated from? Perhaps by estimating a percentage of their make-up? Officials couldn’t say."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259661.1590095514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord timing is everything as alan kelly blows another gasket","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Leader Alan Kelly on the plinth in Leinster House on Thursday.  Photograph: Nick Bradshaw“We stand over the slow, steady approach,” said the Taoiseach as a simmering mash of city crowds and bright sunshine transformed beauty spots into giant Covid fermentation vats.Although maybe “we” wasn’t the best choice of word, with a waiting Alan Kelly across the way, cheerily priming his gasket in advance of blowing it.At least Leo Varadkar has the weather on his side. The forecast for the weekend isn’t great, so that should cut right down on numbers socially sardining in defiance of the health guidelines. He thinks everyone has been doing a great job helping to suppress the virus.In his latest bulletin from the pandemic front, the Taoiseach thanked the Irish people for sticking with the restrictions of The Great Reopening, but warned of the need to “stay vigilant”. If we play this by the book, the Government will be able to further lift restrictions. He told the Dáil to await a fresh dispatch early next month.So well done everyone.Unfortunately, though, the economy is going to hell in a handcart. So don’t get too carried away.If the Covid doesn’t get us in the chest it’ll get us in the coffers.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe outlined the grim prospects on Wednesday. His boss continued with the bad news on Thursday.Unemployment. Reduced living standards for many. Infrastructure costs rising. There will have to be large amounts of borrowing.“It might cost us more to do less . . . There is no such thing as free money . . . Brexit’s not over . . . Parts of our economy might never look the same again . . . Inflation . . .” Leo was laying it out straight.“On the upside, we haven’t been shut out of the money markets.”“So the next government, whenever it takes office, will have to sail the ship of State through the hardest of rocks and the toughest of hard places.”It won’t be easy, but steering the way to safety “can be done”, he reassured the nation.And who (hint, hint) might be the leader to do that?The Fianna Fáil leader was next up with a sensible contribution on the crisis, a statesmanly bit at the end about co-operation between the EU states, and some well-justified criticism of the way the Government has handled the unwinding.“The ision between shops that are allowed to open and those which must remain closed simply makes no sense,” he said, citing the “foolish” distinction between hardware and homeware stores.It seems Micheál is a curtains-over-cans of paint man.Small businesses kept shuttered will applaud him for calling out those grasping big stores “actively trying to fill the gaps” in their absence from the market.“There is clear unfairness in that.”And what is the sense in opening the golf courses but only allowing access to people who live within 5km of them?“I don’t play golf,” stressed Micheál, anxious not to see his rating plummet further in polls.But he doesn’t want to appear difficult in a time of crisis. And he is also negotiating to go into government with Leo Varadkar.“I say this in a helpful way.”Oh, and there’s Alan Kelly, still waiting his turn, nursing his rumbling gasket.Micheál had given the Ceann Comhairle food for thought.“Next is deputy McDonald,” he said, as the Sinn Féin leader rose to her feet. “Do you play golf, by the way?”“No, not as of yet, Ceann Comhairle, but who’s to say? I might be resigned to playing golf if it is so desired by the public. Let’s hope not.”Was it our imagination or did Eamon Ryan sound more focused than usual? Nothing like an imminent leadership challenge to sharpen the game. The Green Party leader asked a number of questions. The Taoiseach thought his ideas about making more space available for cyclists and pedestrians during the crisis was excellent.“Every crisis does create opportunities,” said Leo, and he wasn’t referring to the leader of the Labour party, who was psyching himself to perform one of his famous scenes.This time, Alan Kelly was like a dog with a bone, worrying away at the health guidance for gatherings in Leinster House which landed among politicians on Tuesday morning and has been causing ructions every since. If Dáil proceedings are run according to them, it means no TD will be able to spend more than two hours in the chamber in any 24-hour period.Alan even brought along a prop.“I’ve my stopwatch with me because I’m back here later on. Not a joke.”The was nothing for it but to blow another gasket. It’s what he does best.The advice is totally unrealistic, he fumed. “It is absolutely bonkers. It’s bonkers.” He managed to say “bonkers” three times, just in case the headline writers didn’t hear it straight off.Then he quoted George Orwell.He also introduced a new word to us. He threw it around with abandon, returning to it when bearding the Minister for Health later in the afternoon with his same objections about important information which was only “socialised” to people at the beginning of the week.“Why was the public health information not socialised earlier?” he demanded.It sounds like corporatespeak, as in, “Hey guys, let’s socialise this idea with the stakeholders and harvest the learnings . . .”Simon Harris, who is somewhat impressionable when it comes to this sort of thing, then started using it in his replies. This must be stopped.However, he is forgiven because of the sweet way he bunged Alan’s gasket firmly back in place after being harried by him over the unworkable social distancing guidelines issued to the Oireachtas on Monday. Did NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) know anything about this? Why did NPHET not issue similar instructions for other workplaces?“You’re obsessed with NPHET. You’’ll be blaming NPHET for Covid next.”Kelly flew off again. “Withdraw that remark!”“OK, I withdraw that,” muttered the Minister.So fast you could barely hear him socialise it."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258625.1590008067!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 200 000 earning more on covid 19 unemployment payment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Paschal Donohoe:  warned that the Government would face demands to increase regular job seekers’ benefits up to the level of the weekly Covid-19 unemployment payments. Photograph:  Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireA significant minority of people in receipt of the €350 pandemic unemployment payment were paid less than €300 a week before the payment was introduced, a Government report has said, as questions continue about the future of the payment.The report, compiled by the Department of Business, raises concerns about “significant disincentive effects associated with the pandemic unemployment payment with 38 per cent of recipients previously earning less than €300 per week”.With almost 600,000 people receiving the special payment, it means that over 200,000 people are better off unemployed than they were while working. That number includes many people who were working part-time in the hospitality industry.Although there are growing worries in Government about the sustainability of the payment, Ministers are likely to extend the special payment over summer, declining to either signal a firm end date or to close the scheme, according to sources familiar with the discussions on the topic.Yesterday, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned that the Government would face demands to increase regular job seekers’ benefits up to the level of the weekly Covid-19 unemployment payments if these were to be maintained at the current rates until the end of the year.At present people who were unemployed prior to the current coronavirus crisis receive jobseekers’ benefit of €203 per week. However those who lost their jobs on foot of Covid-19 receive a special pandemic unemployment payment of €350 per week.There is a general belief among Ministers that the €350 a week payment cannot continue indefinitely. But there is no consensus on how to bring it to an end.Yesterday, Mr Donohoe said if the Government was to continue paying the special Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment at the current levels until the end of the year as had been suggested, it would then face “an understandable issue” in which citizens who were unemployed prior to the current crisis would ask why their jobseeker benefits were so much lower.Mr Donohoe’s forecast of demands for unemployment benefit equality came as the Government faced calls to extend the separate special weekly € 350 payment for those with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection to cancer patients who were cocooning.The Irish Cancer Society said on Wednesday cocooning cancer patients “must have fair access to pandemic illness payments so they do not feel forced to risk an unsafe return to work”.The group said it was unfair that cancer patients who were unable to return to work because they are cocooning could not access the payment.Everything

Photograph: Kirsty O’ConnorPA WireIt was just before eight in the morning and like most people in London these days, the man queuing in front of me outside the bakery was complaining about the government. As a businessman, he could identify every one of the failures of project management behind the bungling of the coronavirus response and the delay in testing, tracking and tracing.“Look at South Korea. Look at Germany, ” he was saying.“Look out behind you,” I said as a builder walked past with a length of timber over his shoulder.We turned to talking about the bakery, a shrine to sourdough in the heart of Belgravia in which every customer agrees it is a privilege to be allowed to shop. The interior is cold, dark and silent with all the joviality of a 19th\u0026nbspcentury French peasant’s dwelling the day after most of his children have died.Along a shelf on the side wall stand the giant, two-kilo sourdough loaves the size of basketballs and below them a handful of smaller rye and walnut loaves. A sorrowful young woman in a brown pinafore and beige apron keeps watch behind a counter laden with straw baskets, one of them filled with the turd-shaped sourdough rolls that nourished the impoverished artists of Montparnasse in the middle of the last century.The shop is so small that social distancing allows only one customer inside at a time and before the businessman went inside, he told me he never accepted a loaf from the shelf.“I tell them to go in and get me one from the back. They don’t like it,” he said.“I’m sure they don’t,” I said.I didn’t like his attitude and catching the eye of the woman behind me, I recognised another true believer and could see she didn’t like it either. When he was gone, we both gazed at a plate of brown raisin rolls in the dingy shop window.“Marvellous, isn’t it?” I said.“A lifeline,” she said.Chilly indifferenceThe bakery remained open throughout the lockdown while everything around it was closed but there have been signs of life in the neighbourhood this week.My favourite French restaurant is offering a reduced menu for takeaway, ingeniously conveying the chilly indifference that is the house style by charging more for each dish than when they served it inside. You have to put in your order 24 hours in advance and everything is cold when you pick it up and has to be reheated at home.The dry cleaners which had been opening only on Saturdays is now open every day as more people return to work. The long queues outside supermarkets have all but disappeared and the sound of traffic has started to drown out the birdsong again.The man who sells coffee and sandwiches from the green wooden kiosk on the square near the Tube station says the builders are busier than ever and they’re keeping him going.“The government is driving us down, down, down. The country’s got to get moving,” he said.The London Underground remains empty most of the time and station announcements urge passengers not to take the Tube but to walk or cycle instead. But on a couple of days this week, there were no recorded cases of coronavirus in London and many businesses in the capital are eager to open up again.\u0026nbspSchool isionsTheir impatience is shared by much of the Conservative parliamentary party but polls show that the public is wary of easing the lockdown too soon. Nowhere are the isions deeper than over whether to reopen schools for some children on June 1st, as Boris Johnson has said he wants to.The government’s plan is for the equivalent of junior infants, senior infants and fifth class in primary school to go back first, with third year and fifth year in secondary school to follow soon afterwards. But YouGov found this week that the British public oppose the plan by 50 per cent to 36 per cent. 18-24 year-olds are especially critical of the approach, with 56 per cent opposing it compared with 42 per cent among those over 65.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspData collected by Google for Public Health England has found, however, that the number of people visiting parks is approaching pre-lockdown levels and footfall around transit hubs and workplaces has been rising gradually.Despite what they tell the pollsters, British people are apparently either voting with their feet in favour of a return to work or finding themselves unable to manage without it.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Look at them, with their enviable thighs in impossible shorts, sitting in the sunshine all hugger-mugger, drinking and laughing and even snogging. It’s not your imagination: a new survey by University College London has found that less than 50 per cent of people under 30 are complying with strict lockdown rules.This might explain why, according to figures from Public Health England, they have the highest rate of infection of any age group in the country. In early April, when the epidemic reached its peak in the UK, 11 per cent of people aged 17 to 29 were found to be carrying the virus, compared to just seven per cent of over-60s.And yet, I find it hard to summon up much intergenerational wrath. Young people have always felt themselves to be immune to death it is one of their most attractive, useful, and occasionally troublesome, qualities. In this particular instance, they’re not far wrong. For people aged 10-29 who contract Covid-19, the risk of dying is approximately 0.0069 per cent – or one in 14,492.The over 70s, for whom the risk is roughly one in 23, have good reason to be afraid. But the young are being asked to give up everything that makes youth enjoyable – freedom, adventure, sex, friendships, parties – because of something that poses no meaningful threat to them.You could argue that they should do it for communitarian reasons, selflessly putting their own lives on hold to make the world safer for the rest of us. That, indeed, has been the logic of the lockdown. But hasn’t it cost them enough already? Job prospects have been shredded. Student life has been stripped of its pleasures. Several universities, including Cambridge, have announced that they will only offer lectures online until September 2021. In which case, why bother leaving home?Paying thousands of pounds in rent and tuition fees to live in a strange city with no social life and lessons on Zoom seems an unpromising formula for the supposed Best Years of Your Life. No wonder one in five of the students who were meant to be starting university in September say they want to defer their place.This virus has snatched the future from a generation. Who can blame them for seeking a little joy in the present?On Wednesday a horrible bubo erupted in my armpit (the result, I suspect, of wearing a sports bra all day every day in anticipation of the run I never quite manage to go on). I rang my GP surgery, and was told that a doctor would call me back for an online consultation.Having had bitter experiences of NHS technology in the past – the online booking systems that rebuff every attempt at logging on, the endless computer-says-no confusions over appointment times and locations – I had low expectations.But it turned out to be the most painless doctor’s appointment of my life. The doctor texted me a link to the NHS version of Zoom, I logged in without difficulty, explained the problem and showed her the eruption on my cameraphone. She then Googled my nearest chemist and sent them a prescription for antibiotics, which I collected an hour later.A fast, efficient, same-day consultation, with no sitting about in waiting rooms leafing through greasy copies of Take A Break.

Previous research by Nasa has shown that pollution can seed clouds, while particles in the sky block incoming sunlight.Research published this week has shown a 17 per cent fall in carbon emissions globally because of the lockdown. Some areas of London have seen a 48 per cent reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels.Professor Andrew Charlton-Perez, of Reading University, said it would be difficult to prove conclusively that the lockdown had led to sunnier weather, but added: It is certainly possible that there is a small effect due to reductions in pollution.A number of studies are beginning to show reductions in a number of pollutants since lockdown. Similarly, there could be a small effect due to reductions in air traffic and contrail formation.In both cases though, the sunny weather is really driven by the meteorology – without blocking conditions, we wouldn\u0027t have had the sunny weather. We have just been lucky in this case to be in the right place at the right time.The spring has been so sunny that it is almost certain to beat many summers in the sunshine record, despite spring having significantly fewer hours of daylight. Although the Reading observatory is only one of hundreds of official weather stations across the UK, the conditions recorded there are indicative of the wider settled weather patterns that have dominated the region\u0027s weather during the lockdown.Dr Peter Inness, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, said: The last few months have been unusual for everyone in lots of ways – but at least this includes the weather being unusually sunny. We have seen some record-breaking weather this year already, but for this spring to even rival the sunniest summers on record is quite extraordinary.The cause of all this sunny weather has been a proliferation of high pressure conditions to the west of Britain, with associated descending air and clear skies over the UK. Conversely, the Iberian Peninsula has been very wet this spring.In recent days, there has been some discussion in the media of how weather conditions over the summer might influence how tolerable lockdown will be for all of us and our mental health. Although there are major social inequalities in access to green space in the UK, this extended and unusual period of fine weather is likely to have been a big boost to many.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus tests giving results 20 minutes could rolled nationwide","story":"On-the-spot coronavirus tests which give results in only 20 minutes will begin public trials on Friday as part of efforts to get the UK out of lockdown.On Thursday night, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, announced the launch of a major trial aiming to give people instant information about whether they are carrying the virus. If successful, the scheme will be rolled out nationally in six weeks, with pop-up facilities and drive-through facilities planned.Mr Hancock said the testing regime was the guiding star to restore freedom in this country as he launched the new measures to try to track the spread of the virus. He also announced that the Government has signed contracts for 10 million antibody tests, which will first be offered to NHS and care workers.The Health Secretary said surveillance antibody testing has now revealed that around 17 per cent of people in London, and at least five percent of those in the rest of the country, have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.The announcement follows a litany of testing failures and criticism after the Government repeatedly missed the target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day. Soon after health officials had boasted of buying 3.5 million antibody tests for use by the public, they were forced to admit none of the kits, purchased from China, worked.The saga – and criticism of the targets attached to the plans – has led to reports that Mr Hancock\u0027s job is on the line if there is no breakthrough soon in efforts to use a test, track and trace strategy to get the UK out of lockdown.Health officials said the antigen tests, which have already been proven to succeed in test settings, will now be tried on up to 4,000 people in Accident and Emergency departments, GP testing hubs and care homes. If the pilot succeeds it will become the standard way to test for the virus, with millions of people offered the tests from July.The instant nature of the checks means those who test positive could be instructed to self-isolate immediately, rather than far larger numbers having to do so as a precaution while they await test results. Friends and family could also be offered the checks under the test, track and trace strategy. Mr Hancock said the instant tests could change the way that we control Covid-19 across the country, getting those with negative results back into society as quickly as possible.Getting a test is important, but getting a quick result is important too, he told Thursday\u0027s Downing Street press conference.It is interesting to us because it is so fast. It doesn\u0027t need to be sent to a lab to be processed, and so you get the result on the spot, typically within around 20 minutes. It\u0027s already proven effective in early trials and we want to find out if it will be effective on an larger scale.”The trial of on-the-spot tests will start in Hampshire, with up to 4,000 people of all ages and backgrounds tested. The new test does not need to be sent to a laboratory to be processed.Receiving results on site will mean people with symptoms will be given immediate certainty on whether or not they have the virus and rapidly follow advice to stay at home if they test positive or return to work if negative.The scheme will be led by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Trust, with trained health professionals asked to take a swab and process results on site. Mr Hancock said: Our testing regime will be our guiding star. It\u0027s the information that helps us to search out and defeat this virus.In the pilot, tests will be offered to patients and health workers with symptoms of the virus, and to all residents and care workers in selected care homes.The Health Secretary said they would be particularly useful for health and care staff, adding: This will enable health and care workers to carry on with their shift or immediately isolate on the same day, and could eventually offer the same benefit to the whole country.Unlie standard tests, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (Lamp) swab test does not require a change in temperature to detect results. This means it can be processed on site rather than being sent to a laboratory.On Thursday, the Government also announced that it had signed contracts for 10 million antibody tests, which show whether a person has ever been exposed to coronavirus.Mr Hancock has come under fire over the slow rollout of the test, track and trace scheme being piloted on the Isle of Wight. Previously, he had said the national rollout would come in mid-May, but it is now not expected to start until next month.Earlier this week, his scientific advisers warned that the system needs to be in place before schools reopen, currently scheduled for June 1.On Thursday, Mr Hancock insisted delivery of the scheme – which uses an app to alert people when they have been in the presence of someone who tested positive, as well as manual contact tracers – would be reached by the start of next month.A source close to the Health Secretary said: Matt Hancock knows his job is on the line if this doesn\u0027t work.The source said the app had become a distraction but was not key to the test and trace working, saying it had become the story when it was only ever supposed to be an additional tool in the fight against the virus.Under the system, anybody testing positive will be contacted by the tracing team and asked for details of close contacts. These contacts will be told to self-isolate for 14 days if the level of contact is considered high risk, and will only be tested if they develop symptoms. If contact is low risk, there is no requirement to self-isolate.But the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday that he was deeply concerned there were no plans to test every close contact of people who tested positive. Mr Hunt, now the chairman of the Commons health committee, said: I am more and more worried about the testing side. They are just going to tell people to self-isolate when I would have thought the obvious thing to do is test them.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dolphins lavish humans gifts lockdown australias cooloola coast","story":"Dolphins on Queensland’s Cooloola Coast have reacted to the decline of human visitors to the once-popular tourist spot by lavishing those who do come with gifts.One 29-year-old male humpback dolphin, “Mystique”, was already known for occasionally bringing items to shore but in recent weeks has become dramatically more generous.Mystique has taken to bringing the volunteers at Barnacles Café and Dolphin Feeding centre an array of items every day, including timber, shells, wood, and bottles.Dolphin feeding volunteer Lyn McPherson told the ABC that Mystique’s activity has increased while the dolphin feeding centre was closed to tourists.“(He) brings in objects on his rostrum, or beak, and then he carefully presents them to us,” she said. “What we have to do is give him a fish in return… We haven\u0027t trained him, but he has trained us to do this. We swear he has a collection waiting to bring to us… Sometimes he will bring 10, one at a time, and he will line them up as he has to get fish.”Locals say other humpback dolphins are also bringing gifts, such as sponges, barnacle-covered bottles and fragments of coral to the feeding centre.“Nothing surprises me with dolphins and their behaviour anymore,” Barry McGovern, a dolphin expert and PhD student at University of Queensland, told 7News.“They do everything - they use tools, they have culture, they have something similar to names in signature whistles. In all likelihood, they probably don’t miss humans per se…They probably miss a free meal and the routine,” he said.In 2017 researchers at the University of Western Australia captured footage of male humpback dolphins presenting females with large marine sponges as gifts.Scientists from UWA’s School of Biological Sciences, the University of Zurich and Murdoch University conducted a decade of boat-based research on coastal dolphins across north-western Australia and found, for the first time, the adult male humpback dolphins gave marine sponges to females, and performed visual and acoustic displays, to impress potential mates.Lead author Dr Simon Allen from UWA’s School of Biological Sciences said the findings suggested an as yet unrecognised level of social complexity in humpback dolphins.“We were at first perplexed to witness these intriguing behavioural displays by male humpback dolphins, but as we undertook successive field trips over the years, the evidence mounted… Here we have some of the most socially complex animals on the planet using sponges, not as a foraging tool, but as a gift,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london has no new covid cases retaining ridiculous lockdown","story":"What are we waiting for? What would be the magical piece of evidence which would finally persuade the government that the lockdown is no longer serving any useful purpose, that we are destroying the economy for little or no gain?Would it be, say, when new reported infections of Covid-19 reached single figures? Or when we went 48 hours with not a single death from the disease?Obviously not, because both those conditions were reached in London this week and yet there has not been a sniff of the government  changing  its policy. The country is still officially in lockdown, with the possibility of a slight easing of restrictions, such as the opening of some shops, dangled before us for June 1.Ten days ago the Prime Minister unveiled his new ‘Covid Alert System’ of five stages which we must travel through before we can finally be lifted out of lockdown. At the time, he said, we were in stage 4 (severe) but on the verge of moving down into stage 3 (substantial). Look at the transmission figures for London, however, and it is hard not to come to the conclusion that we already at level 2 (“low transmission”) and in sight of going down to level one, where the disease “is no longer present”.  So could London, at least, open up some of its businesses ahead of the rest of the country? No. That was ruled out by culture secretary Oliver Dowden yesterday.Britain has regularly been described as an “outlier” in this crisis. That is not an accurate description of what happened at the beginning – when the UK government at first resisted lockdown but soon changed its mind and enforced pretty much the same rules as most other European countries. We were pretty well middle-field: less harsh in our rules than Italy, Spain or France but more severe than Germany, the Netherlands or Denmark. The only outlier was Sweden, which has never had a lockdown.But we are certainly beginning to look like an outlier now. If you want to buy a shirt, a book or some other ‘non-essential’ item in person, Britain is just about the only country left where it remains forbidden. Bars and restaurants are beginning to open even in Italy, one of the most affected countries, yet here the earliest prospect of their reopening is July 4.      Wales and Scotland seem to want to stand out even further: they are now the only countries in Europe where it is still forbidden to have a game of tennis or golf. We are continually warned about a second spike, yet none of the other countries which are opening up has suffered one.The government made some serious errors at the beginning of this crisis: over PPE, dropping community testing, over allowing elderly patients to be discharged from hospital into care homes without being tested, when it was known how serious the disease is for the elderly. But those errors cannot be put right now by remaining in lockdown long after every other country has started to emerge.   On the contrary, by keeping us locked down the government is compounding its errors. We face becoming the European country not just with the greatest number of deaths but with the greatest economic damage, too.          More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools must sanitise library books monitor pupils face touching","story":"Schools have been told to sanitise library books and have a system in place to watch children\u0027s face-touching before they reopen, guidelines show.Arts and crafts materials used for painting, sticking and cutting should also be washed before and after use by children, the guidance, published by the UK\u0027s largest teachers\u0027 union, says.The National Education Union (NEU) has published a checklist of over 100 issues on which members should seek assurance from their school before they agree to return to work.Teachers have been told not to mark homework or take any schoolbooks home in order to avoid the spread of coronavirus. “It will not be safe to mark children\u0027s books during this period. Will clear instruction be given that no marking should take place and the books should not be taken to and from homeschool?” the checklist says.“Will staff be told to wash their hands before and after handling pupils\u0027 books? Will library books be regularly sanitised?”A separate checklist published by the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) said schools must review and update their behaviour policies to ensure they cover “Covid-19-related incidents”.The union says schools must be able to sanction pupils who “wilfully refuse” to adhere to social distancing measures, as well as those who “deliberately cough or spit” at fellow pupils or staff.The Department for Education (DfE) has said every school must carry out a risk assessment before reopening.Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has asked schools to prepare to welcome pupils in nursery, Reception, Year One and Year Six from June 1, with the “ambition” that the rest of primary school children return by the end of that month.Local councils have also drawn up risk assessment forms for schools under their remit to complete before reopening next month.Children should only be accompanied to school or picked up at the end of the day by one parent rather than two, according to Cumbria County Council\u0027s guide.Meanwhile, teachers in Derbyshire have been told not to make drinks for each other and to greet each pupil on arrival and ensure they wash their hands before entering their classroom.Derbyshire County Council\u0027s guidance advises schools to leave the classroom one row at a time to “manage pinch points”.Elsewhere, schools have been told to remove anything that is difficult to clean regularly, such as toys and soft furnishings.But Professor Colin Diamond, a former DfE adviser, said that “feels cruel”, adding: “This, to me, illustrates the absurdity of trying to introduce a safe regime which has to be socially distant. Of course children need cuddly toys and to relax on cushions.This is not a very impressive idea. I can\u0027t help but think that whoever wrote the guidance doesn\u0027t know much about a nursery or classroom.”  Councillor Judith Blake, the chair of the Local Government Association\u0027s children and young people board, said: “Councils are keen to support their local schools to get children back as soon as possible. However, the safety of children, their families and staff will always be the top priority.“As there are different Covid-19 infection rates around the country, schools and councils must be able to work together to decide how and when schools open to more children. Some areas may want to work faster than others.”Official advice from the DfE says schools\u0027 risk assessments should “directly address risks associated with coronavirus, so that sensible measures can be put in place to control those risks for children and staff”.It adds that all employers “have a duty to consult employees on health and safety, and they are best placed to understand the risks in inidual settings”.Class sizes should be split in half, with a 15-pupil limit, and a “one-way system” operated in corridors, the DfE guidelines say.The beginning and end of the day will be staggered to avoid congestion at the gates, while surfaces should be regularly cleaned.  If a child displays coronavirus symptoms and tests positive, the rest of their class, as well as their teacher, would need to self-isolate and would be offered free tests.  Earlier this week, Mr Johnson pledged to get contact tracing in place by the start of next month, saying he hopes the “world-beating” test and trace system will satisfy teacher union concerns over staff safety.Unions had suggested the lack of such a system would stop teachers safely returning to school but, speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Johnson insisted it would be in place by June 1.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two metre rule should scrapped immediately","story":"What’s in a metre? Four rungs up a ladder, half the length of a bed. Yet in the social distancing debate, this difference is one small step for man, a giant leap for mankind. Lives, livelihoods, entire industries hang in the balance.The Government has so far urged the public to keep at least two metres away from non-household members – a command which places us in a vanishingly small minority. Britain is one of only two European countries to enforce this rule many more have followed WHO guidance that one metre is safe or adopted compromise positions in between. Those insisting we “follow the science” forget that epidemiology, like the virus, is no respecter of national borders.Safetyism may be a very British disease, but the two-metre rule carries incalculable risks. It should be blindingly obvious that swathes of the economy – shops, restaurants, gyms, theatres and pubs – cannot survive on the reduced capacity it implies. According to Emma McClarkin of the British Beer and Pub Association, the rule would mean that only 20 per cent of pubs kept afloat when they are allowed to reopen, whereas a one-metre rule “would put the majority... back in play”. Theatres, whose product cannot be converted into takeaway, are facing particular struggles that could prove existential – and insuperable – if the two metre rule continues when performances resume.Urban eateries and watering holes face a dual onslaught both from changing work habits and the rule itself. Earlier this week, Grant Shapps claimed that, with the two-metre rule in place, public transport could only run at 10 per cent of normal capacity, while companies are busy preparing staff for long periods of working remotely. London would surely be wrecked as a consequence, alongside the UK’s other capitals and bustling conurbations like Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. This would not just be tragic for the businesses going to the wall and staff made redundant it would destroy the buzz and vibrancy which give these cities their distinctive character.Our infrastructure isn’t equipped for this madness, and nor are our social instincts. A popular joke is doing the rounds in Finland – “So, we now have to stay two metres away from each other? Why so close?” – but we are not the Finns. Two metres versus one means the difference between enjoying an intimate chat with a friend and having to shout. Two metres will drive our economy into the ground, while driving everyone mad in the interim.And for what end? The figure is an arbitrary compromise the precise thinking behind it hails from 1930s experiments by Harvard scientist Willam Wells into the contagiousness of tuberculosis. Other scientists beg to differ, though the Government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told the health select committee that the risk at one metre “is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at two.” This may seem a scary multiple at first glance, but it is meaningless without context – a negligible risk at two metres may still be trivial when multiplied by 30.With so much at stake, the policy justification ought to be transparently explained to the public, especially as evidence mounts that casual interactions are barely driving transmission and the risks of catching the virus outdoors are low. Yet SAGE experts have reportedly warned ministers against changing the rule at this stage, for fears it could prove “confusing”.This is not just laughably patronising one metre is as easy to understand as two, and the public is perfectly familiar with the concept of rules changing as the threat from the virus recedes. The fact that ministers continue to hide behind this advice demonstrates a worrying lack of political courage. Complex decisions must never be the sole preserve of boffins, dealing in black and white. If scientists were asked to assess the safe distance to stand apart, they might say one mile, but that would clearly be unworkable. In dynamic economies, decisions must consider more than just marginal health benefits.Our country needs economic growth for its very survival, something that is impossible at a two metre distance. Unless we realise this – and soon – our lack of pragmatism could prove more deadly than the virus itself.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/10/24/15/cumberbatch-doctor-strange-movie.jpg","title":"avengers endgame plot hole ancient one doctor strange hulk","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The franchise has been good at avoiding continuity issues, but one critical plot hole has arisenThere is a major plot hole in Avengers: Endgame concerning the Ancient One’s faith in Benedict Cumberbatch’s character, Doctor Strange.Digital Spy came up with the continuity problem, recalling the time-travel heist seen in the 2019 blockbuster.During these scenes, the Avengers try and fail to get three Infinity Stones from New York in 2012.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHulk then goes to see the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) at her sanctum, hoping she will give him one of the precious stones.Initially, she doesn’t want to give away the stone as taking them can create darker timelines. She explains: “It’s the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.”Why is it hard to take pop stars seriously as actors?What the pandemic reveals about the value of Tom Stoppard’s artBut, Hulk persuades the Ancient One to give him the Infinity Stone by telling her that Doctor Strange gave it away.The Ancient One concludes that Doctor Strange must have given it away for a good reason because “Strange is meant to be the best of us”, so she gives the stone over to Hulk. Here lies the inconsistency. In 2016’s Doctor Strange, the Ancient One refused to train Strange when he visited Kamar-Taj. If she knew the prophecy about the stone in 2012, why would she refuse to teach him?“Stubbornness. Arrogance. Ambition. I’ve seen it all before... I cannot lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness,” the Ancient One tells Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).Why, then, would the Ancient One would be so convinced of Strange’s ability four years earlier?

The monthly total is the lowest since HMRC began collecting data in April 2005.

However, restrictions remain in other parts of the UK.Andrew Southern, chair of property developer Southern Grove, said: “Residential transactions are usually motivated by necessity so, subject to the economic realities that prevail as the country starts to emerge from this crisis, many of these missing sales should rise from the deep.”On Tuesday, property website Rightmove enjoyed its busiest day since Thursday 5 March, with nearly 5.3 million visits. Rightmove’s housing market expert, Miles Shipside, said: “One week on from the surprise opening of the housing market and agents are still showing caution and quite rightly putting safety first, but many had already started to prepare during lockdown and so have been able to start reopening their branches and conducting viewings.“The activity jump on Rightmove proves the determination of home movers to continue with their plans over the next few months.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One of the links was the Kremlin-directed Internet Research Agency (IRA) which, between 2015 and 2017, flooded social media with “false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls.”“One big area that we were behind on in 2016 but I think now are quite advanced at is identifying and fighting these co-ordinated information campaigns that come from different state actors around the world,” Zuckerberg said. “I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince 2016, the company has made numerous decisions in order to try and quell the influence of bad actors on its platforms – which also include Instagram and WhatsApp. This has included creating an archive for political adverts with information about ad impressions and spend, as well as demographic data such as age, gender and location. There is also now a verification process in place for advertisers, while “millions” of fake and suspicious accounts have been banned.Trump threatens Twitter and Facebook over ‘illegal situation’In 2019, the company said it would take action against content that “does not directly violate our Community Standards, but still undermines the authenticity of the platform” by reducing its distribution in the main News Feed and adding in contextual information next to the post so people can better access details about the publisher. These actions continued into 2020 ahead of the upcoming US election. However, while the question of whether the company is prepared for the upcoming election remains to be seen, evidence suggests that some problems still remain. During the UK election in 2019, the company refused to remove doctored videos by the Conservatives, which criticised the now-leader of the Labour Party and then-Brexit spokesperson Kier Starmer.  Rebecca Stimson, Facebook’s UK head of public policy, said at the time that “we don’t believe a private company like Facebook should censor politicians. This is why we don’t send content or ads from politicians and political parties to our third-party fact checking partners”.Even when the company said it would partner with fact-checkers, it still said it would not remove misinformation – a particularly troubling aspect when a study found that 88 per cent of all Conservative adverts were found to be misleading compared to seven per cent of Labour’s adverts.When Conservative Party adverts were removed, where clips from BBC news reports were used out of context, it was done on the grounds that it violated intellectual property rather than because the government was proactively spreading disinformation. Writing in 2019 Facebook’s ex-head of global elections integrity ops Yaël Eisenstat made scathing criticisms of the social media giant, stating that “the real problem is that Facebook profits partly by amplifying lies and selling dangerous targeting tools that allow political operatives to engage in a new level of information warfare.”Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformTech platforms rush to remove viral, false ‘Plandemic’ videoFacebook announces oversight board to decide free speech controversiesShe added: “It’s clear that the company won’t make the necessary fixes without being forced to, either by advertisers who refuse to spend money on their platforms until Facebook cleans up the spread of misinformation and other harmful content employees who continue to demand accountability and responsibility from their leaders and most immediately, government action.”An ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica – the firm which scraped user data in breach of Facebook’s terms and conditions to tilt the election in the Republican’s favour – said that Facebook has not learned its lessons since the 2016 election.“Of the billions of dollars that are being spent on the American elections, most of the political advertising money will flow to Facebook and – based on what I saw at Cambridge Analytica – none of it, as far as I am aware, will be fact-checked. No content will be blocked or removed, even if it’s found to be demonstrably false” Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Brittany Kaiser wrote.“Fake news ads from the Trump campaign about his political rival Joe Biden were blocked by CNN, but have been hosted on Facebook for months racking up millions of views by impressionable voters.”Facebook\u0027s work since the last US elections has attempted to walk the fine line between freedom of speech and ensuring its platform is free from misinformation and disinformation, but it remains unclear whether or not it has been enough to protect democracy.

The rocket can reach a height of approximately 100km, and carry a payload of up to 60kg.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It is very hard to oversell what we have achieved here with this test the whole team has pulled through again to deliver another UK first, said Dr Jack-James Marlow, who led the operations of Skylark L’s static fire testing.We have successfully static tested a fully integrated, sub-orbital Skylark L launch vehicle in flight configuration. This means we performed all actions of a launch but did not release the vehicle. The rocket engine successfully burned, with all vehicle systems showing nominal operation.”Trump says ‘space is the future’ at unveiling of Space Force flagAstronomers find ‘regular rhythms’ coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutesSkyrora’s chief executive officer, Volodymyr Levykin said: “As the launch aspect of the UK’s new space industry starts to emerge, there will be many events that have never happened here previously and this is one of them. This was a mammoth effort in very trying circumstances, so it is quite an achievement to be proud of.”The company claims this is the first static fire test of its magnitude since the Black Arrow Programme, a three-stage British satellite carrier rocket that was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971.In September 1970, the Black Arrow attempted to carry a British satellite, Orba, into space, but failed to reach orbit. The next year, however, it did carry the Prospero satellite into space, which made the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit via a carrier rocket.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will go on sale shortly.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It’s great to be able to help people in need by creating digital images, especially since most people aren’t allowed out in the world during the lockdown,” he said.“I’ve made the postcards so that everyone has a chance to own one, and all the profits will be donated to charity.How to support our campaign“It feels right to show what can be done from a lockdown situation with a bit of computer magic and lateral thinking.”The images show the butterfly heart design, which was created by the artist for our appeal as a symbol of “solidarity and hope”, being superimposed on buildings in London and across the country, including the Tower of London, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.The limited-edition print of the rainbow butterfly image can be purchased in two sizes, priced at £300 and £1,000.

In 2017-18, £55bn of taxable capital gains were recorded – more than double the amount recorded just five years earlierThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“A clear majority of gains…come from business activity rather than from passive investment and so often reflect a choice to receive remuneration in the form of gains rather than wages,” the researchers say.Rising inequality when capital gains is includedWithin the top 1 per cent, the pattern of rising inequality is even more pronounced, the researchers found, with the total share of the top 0.1 per cent rising from 6 to 8 per cent and the share of the top 0.01 per cent  increasing from 2 to 3.5 per cent.The average total remuneration of those in the top 0.1 per cent – around 5,000 people – has increased from £4.9m to £8.4m since 1997.Adam Corlett of Resolution said that the data, which goes up to 2017-18, suggested a taxation policy agenda for after the Covid-19 crisis has passed.“We now know that the top 1 per cent are even richer than we previously thought – and account for £1 of every £6 of taxable income received, while the income share of the top 0.1 per cent has actually grown almost 50 per cent faster than we thought,” he said.“That scale of inequality should be addressed in post-pandemic Britain.”Dr Advani said the data should also prompt a reassessment of the impact of the post-2010 austerity years and the claims of various Conservative ministers that it had not increased inequality.“Official statistics on the impact of austerity suggest that everyone was ‘in the same boat.’ But our report reveals this is simply not the case,” says Dr Advani.“When you take into account income from capital gains the top one per cent has in fact been doing rather well and inequality has been rising.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, restrictions remain in other parts of the UK.Andrew Southern, chair of property developer Southern Grove, said: “Residential transactions are usually motivated by necessity so, subject to the economic realities that prevail as the country starts to emerge from this crisis, many of these missing sales should rise from the deep.”On Tuesday, property website Rightmove enjoyed its busiest day since Thursday 5 March, with nearly 5.3 million visits. Rightmove’s housing market expert, Miles Shipside, said: “One week on from the surprise opening of the housing market and agents are still showing caution and quite rightly putting safety first, but many had already started to prepare during lockdown and so have been able to start reopening their branches and conducting viewings.“The activity jump on Rightmove proves the determination of home movers to continue with their plans over the next few months.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Domino Park, a six-acre park located off the East River in Williamsburg, has been covered with white circles meant to encourage social distancing in the era of Covid-19. A video shared online showed residents lounging in the circles, which are about six feet in diameter and spaced away from other circles to remind residents to not interact with others. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“They’ve made little round human parking spots in Domino Park in Brooklyn,” wrote Jennifer 8. Lee in the caption to her video. Three months ago the idea of positioning oneself in a painted circle to lounge outside would be a bizarre concept. But now most residents have embraced the park’s guidelines and followed social distancing measures by only sitting in the circles when on the turf.“If you were to take video footage from the world today and show it to someone from 2019, they would think it was from some near-future Hollywood dystopian television show instead of real life,” Ms Lee said. Pictures taken on Monday also showed a majority of residents using the circles and wearing masks when at Domino Park. The public park is owned by a private company and not operated by New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other government officials have collaborated with the NYPD to encourage residents to practice coronavirus protective measures when outdoors, such as passing out masks at parks. Signs also popped up at a number of parks and locations around the city to remind people to stay apart from others when out. Last week the mayor said there would be limits to capacity of parks like Domino Park, Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and piers 45 and 46 in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park over the weekend. But it was not clear if or how these capacity limits were enforced. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An enormous, red Tesla logo covers his torso, and his luminous white belt buckle bears the name of the electric car company. No, Mr Musk\u0027s recent renouncing of material possessions did not result in his ascension to a concrete and plaster godhood. The dystopian structure is actually a repainted statue from the 1960\u0027s meant to court the Tesla CEO into opening a new manufacturing facility in Tulsa. The statue - originally built in 1966 and currently the sixth tallest statue in the US - is called the Golden Driller. Before Mr Musk\u0027s face was painted over the statue\u0027s existing visage and the Tesla iconography was added, the statue was intended to be a tribute to the state\u0027s petroleum industry. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe publicity stunt was carried out by the Tesla Owners of Oklahoma and supported by the city\u0027s mayor, GT Bynum.The Tesla Owners of Oklahoma are part of a broader club of nationwide Tesla owners who describe themselves as a community of owners and enthusiasts committed to evangelizing Tesla\u0027s mission to accelerate the world\u0027s transition to sustainable energy. Club members can help advocate for the company by supporting legislative efforts, offering test drives, volunteering at shows, assisting prospective owners, hosting social events and passionately referring friends and family to explore Tesla ownership for themselves. Mr Musk\u0027s company is currently searching for a location to house its second automotive manufacturing plant in the US. The plant will produce the Model Y utility vehicle as well as the Gibson-esque Cybertruck. According to the company, Tulsa and Austin are both on its short list. While Mr Musk has yet to comment on the rendering of the statue in his image, Mr Bynum said he hopes that amending the statue continues to deliver the message that Tulsa is the right home for Tesla. Matrix director slams Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump for ‘red pill’ tweetsI think this is about convincing people that Tulsa is the best fit for Tesla, I really do believe that, he told Tulsa World. Cities performing tricks for CEOs searching for expansion locations have increased in recent years, becoming the modern altar sacrifice, except rather than burning a slaughtered lamb, they\u0027re painting the face of a South African-born billionaire on a sixty-year-old statue. Maya Kosoff collected a list of desperate stunts cities have pulled in a piece for Vanity Fair. Among them are New York City turning every light in the city orange to try to woo Jeff Bezos into opening Amazon HQ2 in New York the mayor of Frisco, Texas offering to literally plan the expansion of the city around the needs of the Amazon facility and - in a true offering of worship and fealty - the town of Stonecrest near Atlanta offered to rename itself \u0027Amazon\u0027 and make Mr Bezos its permanent mayor.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now make another cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom to make a rectangle that can be thrown away.Step four: Now, to make the ties that secure the mask you need two long strips of fabric. Then unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and nose to secure. This then needs to be tied around the head and around the neck.As well as the simple four step face mask , the government also issued guidance on how to make a sewn face covering.In order to make that you will need a needle and thread, scissors, two cm x cm squares of cotton fabric and two cm pieces of elastic .This process is a little more complicated but can also be completed in just four steps...Step one: Taking your fabric cut out two cm x cm squares of cotton fabric and then stack the two squares on top of each other.Step two: Fold over one side by   cm and hem, then do the same on the opposite side. Make two channels by folding the double layer of fabric over .cm along each side and stitching this down.Step three: Now for the tricky part, you need to run a cmof elastic, string or cloth strip through the wider hem on each side of the face covering. These will be used as the ear loops and you can use a large needle to thread this through.Step four: Pull on the elastic and adjust the fabric so it fits well across your face. The elastic loops should then fit over your ears.The advice from the government however came with a strict warning that people must use materials they already have at home and not try to order PPE online that could otherwise go to to frontline NHS services.It also stated that face coverings did not need to be worn outdoors while exercising.The government also stated that they did not need to be worn by children or by people who may find them dficult to put on themselves. It also stated that the coverings do not need to be worn in schools for children who are still attending.Health Minister Jo Churchill said the strategy has been guided by the science and that thanks to updated advice today, people should consider wearing the masks in public spaces where social distancing is not possible.You do not need a clinical mask which are prioritised for our healthcare workers.Instead a face covering is sufficient and we encourage people to make these at home with items they will already own, she added.This is while Professor Chris Whitty said the face coverings were just added precautions and highlighted that the most effective way to protect yourself from the virus was to stay at home.Previous guidance from the World Health Organisation has stated that when people had worn face masks for prolonged periods of time, they were more likely to put others at risk by not strictly following other hygiene standards such as hand washing and social distancing.When issuing the guidance on face covering making, the government highlighted that it did no endorse any particular way of mask making and that children should be supervised at all timesmaking the masks at home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK. I’m not going to scare the children.”Channel  continuity introducing The Last Leg: Locked Down Under: “Two comedy geniuses coming right up here, Aisling Bea and Kevin Bridges.” So, one comedy genius then. And Aisling Bea.BACK in southern India, on BBC’s hugely enjoyable series The Real Marigold Hotel, Duncan Bannatyne has just bottled the eight-hour overnight train journey to Madurai.It could’ve been the heat, it could’ve been the food and a dodgy stomach.Or it could’ve been the fact Britt Ekland is all over him like a cheap sari, no matter how many times the multi-millionaire businessman mentions his “young we”.A woman who will not be denied, Britt needs male validation and constant reassurance.So, during one of the brief moments she wasn’t pestering Duncan to within an inch of his le, Britt visited a vedic astrologer, in downtown Puducherry, and hit him with this loaded question. “Am I going to have work ”Work  Are you ever, Britt. “The sun is in the constellation of Hasta,” apparently.So I’d expect work on your face, work on your eyelids, work on your rear end. A work frenzy, in fact.As for actual employment, though I think we can safely say Venus’s transit is currently “resting’ and her earth signs will be “aspecting”, until the panto equinox. So I’d go with Plan A Duncan.Yet when Miriam Margolyes told The Last Leg she wanted Boris Johnson to die from coronavirus they said nothing.So do you think this is because A Equity’s learned its lesson about rushing to judgment  Or B The thought she’d said something wrong never entered their thick, hypocritical luvvie heads No need to reply.Danny Murphy: “Spurs have always been consistently inconsistent.”Joe Root: “We have to make sure players don’t get ill, or even unwell.”WORST TV show of the lockdown  I’ll hear your pleas on behalf of Have I Got News For You, Gemma Collins: Diva On Lockdown, The Mash Report, The Steph Show and Mo Gilligan, whose All Star Happy Hour on Channel  makes Rob  Romesh look like Abbott  Costello.But they can, I suppose, all use technology as an excuse. Only stupidity and a tin ear for the public mood can explain my own choice for that title.It’s BBC’s credit card roulette series I’ll Get This, which concluded last week with Fleur East, Johnny Vegas, Mike Tindall, John Barnes and Sue Perkins taking part in a series of minor challenges and guessing games, in a roped-off area of a London restaurant, to settle a £ dinner bill.Not the sort of guessing games that might have engaged viewers, like “guess the appearance fee” or “guess how many TV presenters would have to die before Sue got another stab at hosting the Baftas”, but a game of “Guess the weight of the waiter”.A task more suited to the Bullingdon Club, you’d imagine, but this lot prodded him, lted him and generally talked about him like he was invisible.“I can squat it.” “Oh God, he’s big boned.”Having established, beyond reasonable doubt, there was almost nothing the five celebrities wouldn’t do to get on television, it was the response to the next question – “Do you like or dislike being famous ” – that sealed its place in lockdown hell for me.Unanimously they went for the latter, not with any self-awareness or sarcasm, but with a genuine sense of hurt that anyone could think otherwise and former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Sue Perkins apparently speaking for them all when she very solemnly replied: “I love my job, I dislike being famous.”Some job, Sue.

have a second home in Tuscany and haven’t yet booked your usual budget flight for the we, kids and nanny, isn’t a big deal.But for the majority of people, this wishy-washy stance is plunging them into a maelstrom of confusion over what to do about the family holiday they booked when coronavirus was still but a glint in China’s eye.You can go to France but will have to quarantine for two weeks when

Government ruled that only essential travel was allowed until, say, September October, it would give clarity to all the people trapped in this new version of holiday hell and legally entitle them to a

could rule that holidays on the continent are allowed and you only have to self-isolate on you show symptoms of the virus.But this “wait and see” middle ground is helping no one.Thank God for that.My

brings some much-needed stability and a chance for teachers to keep an eye on their mental and physical health.It also boosts their chances of trying to keep up educationally with all those aforementioned peers who, thanks to their better circumstances, will race ahead even more academically.Factor in that, statistically, the chances of children getting seriously ill from Covid are minuscule and that, until a vaccine is found, there will never be a guarantee of not getting the virus, and it all adds up to one logical conclusion.Schools re-opening isn’t just for those who want to

But the Government furlough system was set up as a fallback to keep people in jobs, not to protect the wealth of multi-millionaires or billionaires by paying their staff for them.Many families who can afford cleaners have dug deep to keep them solvent during this crisis. They have not demanded the public bail them out.Coogan could pay his staff in full without denting even a fraction of the interest on his riches.

Its vast bureaucratic institutions were utterly unable to react to the threat of the virus.So the inidual countries did it all for themselves. Each following a dferent policy. When the moment came, the EU was found wanting. Lethargic, hopeless and riven with internal dispute.There is fury in Spain that the EUwon’t bung them loads of money for being badly hit by the virus.It’s the same in Italy, where  per cent of the population now want to LEAVE the EU. The country that was usually one of the EU’s biggest cheerleaders.A disillusion with the EU is spreading across the continent.People are beginning to see that it’s a good thing to have control of your borders. And that the best way of controlling those borders is through a nation state.The Greeks have been trying to contain a mass influx of refugees from Turkey — and getting no help from the EU in the process. Some senior EU politicians fear that the virus could kill off the EU altogether. Right now it’s on a ventilator and looking very sorry for itself.We can only hope — for the good of our European friends — that someone switches that ventilator off.Once we all emerge from lockdown there will be a financial price to pay. Our economy — the world’s economy — has taken a hell of a battering.But the good news is that we will be in with a much better chance of a full recovery than the EU bloc.From  you will no longer have to pay tarfs on a vast range of goods imported from beyond Europe.I suspect it will lead to a consumer bonanza — which is just what we want. Washing machines, freezers, women’s sanitary products, bicycle inner tubes, Christmas trees — the list of stuff which will be cheaper is almost endless.It’s true thatthe EU refuses to soften its stance about a trade deal with us, then we’ll pay more for cars made on the continent.But even that might have its upside. It will encourage people to buy British. Last year Brits bought only , cars that had been manufactured in the UK. The majority of cars were bought from German plants. Your loss, Germany.The EU negotiators are still being intransigent. They still think they can bully this country.Michael Gove has told them to get real. Sort out an acceptable trade deal for the good of the entire European economy.But eventhey don’t — evenreality fails to establish itself inside their closed minds— it will be the EU that loses out.It wouldn’t surprise me hugelyCovid- outlasted the European Union, frankly. We should all breathe a sigh of relief that we got the hell out of that helpless institution.Just in time.I WONDERCovid- will see an end to hard cash  My local shopkeepers tell me that almost no transactions in the past two months have been paid in cash. It’s all done by card.I’ve had the same  quid in my pocket that was there on March .I bet we don’t go back to paying in cash once this is over. Queuing for ages behind some addled berk at the ATM who is incapable of pressing the right buttons. Cash is going the way of the dinosaurs.And it’s not too far of a stretch to suggest that offices might be on their way out, either. Hugely expensive things to run, offices. And the original reason we had them was to store paper – files and so on. Don’t really need that any more, do we  People have discovered that working from home has many benefits. Not least the pleasure of avoiding pointless meetings with idiots.And for those who feel the need to get away from their families on a daily basis there’s “co-working environments”, or “the park with a load of booze”, as I like to call it.MOST lady slebs are busy during lockdown taking pictures of themselves wearing almost no clothes.Either to advertise products nobody really wants or to advertise themselves. For which many thanks, girls.Scarcely a day goes by without one of them taking a perfectly natural selfie of herself with hardly any clothes on, pouting at the camera like a trout with a botched facelt.Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has gone a stage further and posted pics of herself taken  years ago. Just in case we’d forgotten.I might get in on the act. Next week I’ll take a selfie wearing a leather thong and nipple clamps, advertising my new skincare product made from vole’s urine.Watch this space.I’m not so sure. Boredom is a greatly underrated virtue. It makes you get off your backside and do something. And our kids have been bored senseless for two months now.You never know, this break might do the kids some good. Fire their imaginations or something.And better still – it means they’re not having left-wing drivel drilled into their heads by the teachers…THE English Football League is in a right old mess.None of its three isions can agree what to do about finishing the season.The clubs in the lowest tier, ision two, have voted to end the season immediately. Those in the Championship want to finish the season, while League One clubs haven’t a clue.There’s talk of Coventry and Rotherham being promoted and a play-off between the next EIGHT clubs.I know a lot of money is at stake. I know the league has signed big deals with the broad- casters. But the sensible thing surely would have been to call the season null and void, across all three isions.Those of us who, like me, support clubs who had a chance of promotion will get over our disappointment.There are more important things than football.So let’s look at Sweden. It became the country with the highest death rate per capita from Covid- in Europe during thesevendays to May .The lockdown has unquestionably saved lives.LAST Friday night I was called  times in the space of an hour by the SAME NUMBER.What’s more, my phone told me the call was coming from Tajikistan. But every time I tried to answer, the caller hung up. That’s totally unfair.I have never in my le spoken to a person from Tajikistan. And I would very much like to do so. It might be interesting.I’m sure it was a criminal of some kind, but that’s not the point.I wanted to knowmy caller was a member of the mysterious Yaghnobi people, who live in the mountains in the north of the country, with their many goats. That would have been exciting.I might start ringing up numbers in Tajikistan indiscriminately. And then move on to Kyrgyzstan.That’s what lockdown does to you.For this they have been attacked by “human rights activists”.Perhaps.But not by the people of Hungary, who fully agree with this measure.Much as I suspect people would over here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were tens of thousands of banknotes piled up.They were mainly £ notes and they were piled high, almost to the ceiling.“If you asked him what he did for a living he’d always mumble that he was in property but I never saw him to do a day’s work in his le.“I was aware his father, who had an admin job at the Greek Embassy, had a few properties around North London and I think it’s possible Thanos was involved there.“But he certainly didn’t have a property business in the conventional sense and he never seemed to go to an office to work.I visited The house in King’s Langley with Mandy a couple of times years ago, not long after he’d moved in after his time in Bournemouth.“Well, this property looked impressive from the outside, but inside it was very ordinary – cheap furniture and fixtures and fittings that were very basic.“I had no time for him but because he was family I’d always do my best to get along with him.“He’d always tell you ‘I’m a bit short of cash at the moment.“After Sharon’s funeral we all went back to the house at King’s Langley. The hospitality he laid on was typical Thanos.“There were about  or so of us there, some of whom had travelled long distances, and all he could muster for us were a few crusty sandwiches that seemed to be several days old and a couple of bottles of cheap white wine.”Mr Meiklejohn said that throughout her marriage to the Greek, Sharon “would never hear a bad word about him.”He said: “Her head was completely turned by him.”When his own we Mandy died, the property tycoon “did not bother” to attend her funeral, Mr Meiklejohn said.He added: “He made some excuse about being busy but I knew he just wasn’t interested and I’ve had no reason to see him since.

It doesn’t fit the media narrative of Sturgeon the superstar. Likewise, Scotland has had far more deaths in care homes than England when adjusted for population.And Sturgeon has an even bigger issue when it comes to Scotland’s anaemic testing operation.The country has a much higher rate of Covid- per head than England and has been carrying out just a quarter of the tests England has per capita. Truly dire.So who has emerged as Sturgeon’s knight in shining armour Her bête noire, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who this week announced anyone in the UK with symptoms can receive a test from the NHS.As for those lockdown-lting measures from Boris that pious Sturgeon used for maximum media impact, including a farcical suggestion from her party to introduce a police border between Scotland and England — knock me down with a feather! — she’s only gone and followed suit a week later.Sturgeon’s behaviour in the midst of a genuine international health emergency has been unseemly.But with enemies in her own party circling over her complete failure to push forward the independence cause, expect to see more desperate stunts in the weeks to come. The media should be wise to her tricks.But maybe BBC bosses are finally listening. Five months after I wrote in this column that axing BBC had been disastrous and BBC should have been cut instead, they are now doing a U-turn to make that very change.Right. Time for a  wishlist then. Can EastEnders and Have I Got News For You be chopped next  Oh, and The Mash Report and Newsnight too.But I’ll take two series of The Apprentice a year instead.APPARENTLY it’s only OK to be gayyou’re a raving Corbynista Remoaner.That’s particularly offensive to yours truly – but the only message to take from the shocking cancellation of the Virtual Pride festival this week.Big names from Dannii Minogue to Andrew Lloyd Webber were due to appear during the ten-hour online extravaganza, organised to replace the ious gay gatherings that are usually held over summer.But then, all of a sudden, the event was axed.The organiser, it was claimed, had committed a cardinal sin.Racism  Nope.Sexism  Definitely not.Breaking draconian lockdown restrictions  Hell no.It turns out that Charlie Shakespeare was actually a Brexit supporter who had – shock horror! – liked tweets by Nigel Farage and The Spectator’s associate editor Toby Young.Corbyn adviser Linda Riley, the publisher of Diva magazine, tweeted: “Any LGBTQ event which supports the likes of these will not have my support. #proudtobeapoliticalbigot.”This sort of persecution of an LGBT ally by the London liberal media elite – simply because he harbours a dferent political view – is a disgrace.Just like any other group in society, the gay community is politically erse.And militant LGBT activists should realise we will only achieve true acceptance by embracing this ersity.As well as being an accurate accolade, it’s an apt choice for the lockdown era. “Couldn’t escapeI wanted to . . . ”WHAT does public le in the UK look like without appearances from the Queen Not a prospect I’ve ever wanted to consider, but one growing more and more likely as the -year-old continues to shelter at Windsor Castle with just a skeleton staff.What a tragedyan unexpected consequence of this ghastly pandemic from China is the greatest British monarch of all-time being forced to remain locked away from her adoring public.While far lesser royals might be able to stay front-of-mind with Zoom calls and ious other stunts filmed on mobile phones, that would be unbecoming of the Queen, who has always picked her moments to emerge in public with decorum and class.The idea of regular TV or other media addresses isn’t right either.There is a reason there have only been a handful over the course of her reign. They really mean something.But as a loyal subject, I concur that the health of Her Majesty – deep into the most vulnerable age group – matters more than anything .In a perfect world, I like to imagine she is enjoying the retirement with the Duke of Edinburgh she probably never thought she would have.“Put the kettle on please, Phil.

Similarly, there could be a small effect due to reductions in air traffic and contrail formation.In both cases though, the sunny weather is really driven by the meteorology – without blocking conditions, we wouldnt have had the sunny weather. We have just been lucky in this case to be in the right place at the right time.Data from the University of Readings weather observatory shows that, by am on May , there had been more than  hours of sunshine since the start of March.The spring has been so sunny that it is almost certain to beat many summers in the sunshine record, despite spring having signicantly fewer hours of daylight.Dr Peter Inness, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, told The : We have seen some record-breaking weather this year already, but for this spring to even rival the sunniest summers on record is quite extraordinary.Stunning aerial pictures have also revealed how Britains seas have turned crystal clear due to the lack of pollution during the lockdown.Photographer Mike Woods, ,  who captured some of stunning pictures using his drone said: There has been a lot of talk about the colour of the water in the area recently and I think the perception is, nature is thriving.Weve never, ever seen the water look this clear before, its lovely. "},{"url":null,"title":"landlords push to fully reopen pubs","story":"THOUSANDS of Brits are sinking pints from the pub again as more and more enterprising landlords offer take-outs.Punters are keeping two metres apart in queues before being served by staff wearing PPE - in accordance with government guidance.But industry leaders want social distancing reduced from two metres to one when they fully reopen to keep more of our , boozers afloat.It is feared only  per cent could reopenthe restriction remains.

We are looking at all sorts of proposals to keep drinkers safe so they can enjoy a pint.“If it means making changes to the toilets and closing urinals then so be it although there are some magnicent examples in some of the older pubs across the country. We are also considering a one in one out toilet policy.”Boris Johnson has said his aim is to get the multi-billion pound hospitality business open by early July - as part of the Step  proposals - to catch the rest of the summer for an industry that provides jobs for more than five million people and five per cent of the countrys GDP.He gave a glimmer of hope that we might all enjoy a pint when he told the country earlier his month from Downing Street: “At the earliest by July ...we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.“Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.”And he was backed by government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall who said: “If it is a sunny weekend afternoon and the pub has a garden and the landlords are prepared to accept responsibility for not overcrowding that garden, I see no particular reason why it should not reopen.”Two weeks ago The Sun revealed how four out of ten pubs faces closure with , staff the axe unless the Government steps in to save the industry from “total destruction” and a £ billion rescue package of grants and business rate waivers has been brought in to help save boozers.Other methods being considered are snfer dogs at entrances to detect Covid- before drinkers enter the pub.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School  College Leaders , told headteachers he had received “a lot of reassurance” at the meeting.Speaking in a video to members a few days afterwards, he said: “There was one particularly reassuring one for me – and that is that teachers and other staff ing to their place of work of school or college are not at greater risk than people ing to other key worker jobs.“For me, that is an important reassurance.“Now it’s not enough and what we have said is we cautiously support the direction of travel of the government.“But it did seem to me a lot of that scientic and medical stuff was very helpful in illuminating and providing reassurance about the key issues.”Mr Barton said the meeting was “exceptionally informative, interesting, illuminating and ultimately, for me, reassuring”.Kids are known to not get as sick from Covid-, and there is some evidence they may be less likely to pass it onthey are infected.Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer and a member of Sage, has said the low number of teachers who have died from the virus is a “signal” schools can reopen.She told a Downing Street press conference last weekend: “For teachers – again it’s dficult because we have had lockdown – but [there are] some high-level sort of signals.If you look at the ONS death rates, for example, the teaching profession on that are very low in comparison to a number of other dferent professions or work areas.“So I think we have got a number of signals that say this [schools] are a safe place to go.”Social workers will be placed in schools to help spot the signs of abuse and neglect among kids, ministers announced last night.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is pumping £.million into getting social workers into  schools in England.It is hoped they will be in place by the start of the September term.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make

We keep everything under review and have already proven we will act where necessary.Mr Sunak faced mounting external pressure too yesterday as self-employed bodies warned that failure to extend the scheme in line with the timetable for the furlough scheme would be “a glaring injustice”.Andy Chamberlain from the Association of Independent Professionals said: “The self-employed aren’t just a vital and major part of the workforce: they are also the hard-working entrepreneurs we will need to kickstart the economy after Coronavirus.However, most of them cannot continue their work in the midst of this deadly pandemic and they are relying on government support to keep their businesses afloat.“We were delighted when the government heeded our calls and set up the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, but now it must keep it open as long as the self-employed need it.It must not commit a glaring injustice by extending the employee Job Retention Scheme but pulling the rug from under the self-employed.Maintaining employee support while scrapping self-employed support also risks forcing freelancers back to work in unsafe conditions. It risks forcing them to make an awful choice between their health and their income.”One Tory said Mr Sunak wants to extend the scheme until the end of July but limit access to the grants to self-employed people who can prove they have no other income during that period.He is said to be surprised at how many self-employed people have carried on working while claiming the government grants.The Tory said: No think the figures are so small, so just do it and give the economy a chance to get going again.The compromise will be to extend it to the end of July like the furlough scheme, but the Treasury want conditions - ie no other income during that period.WE understand Rishi Sunak’s fears that the self-employed bailout is ripe for fraud — and his reluctance to extend it.But fair’s fair.The Government cannot shut millions of businesses, then not fully support them.That is a disaster morally, economically and politically.Employees have been seen right.Cut off the cash to self-starters, though, and the lockdown will crumble in minutes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But The Sun has learned that ministers are trying to replicate powerful contact tracing operations that have proved so successful in countries like South Korea and Singapore.A Cabinet source said: “There is agreement across Government now that the process needs to be pretty tough for it to work well.“It might look ruthless. But it’s better to isolate a few dozen or a few hundred than lock down  million people all over again.”The senior figure added: “If the public has been willing to stay at home for eight weeks already, it will understand the need for this.Ministers are in a race against time to get the key programme up and running by June  to allow the nation’s escape form lockdown to move to the next stage.Boris Johnson wants non-essential shops to reopen in nine day time, as well as theof some primary school classes.But government scientists have warned the contact tracing programme must be up running first as a fail safe, as tracers can track , new cases a day.NHS bosses issued a warning yesterday that time was fast running out. In a letter to the Health Secretary, NHS Confederation boss Niall Dickson said: “We really do need to get on with this. I’m not saying it’s impossible but there is concern at a local level”.He added: “Frenetic efforts are going on now. Real progress in the last four or five days. People are under real pressure to deliver, but there is always a risk that we don’t quite make it”.Matt Hancock insisted it doesn’t matter that the NHS’s contact tracing app won’t be introduced at the same time on June , but “weeks” later.The Health secretary insisted: “The technology is an important part, but not the only part”. But the government’s testing tsar John Newton admitted it takes too long to process Covid- tests at the moment, with only % being turned around within  hours.Mr Newton said: “We’re working very hard to get turnaround times down. It would be more effectivewe could do it quickly”.

The Grid is looking at options to get rid of about . gigawatts of surplus power – enough for over three million homes for an hour.

The changes will come two weeks after England relaxed its lockdown in a move that prompted a furious reaction from Nicola Sturgeon. Despite an almighty row at the time, Scotlandaposs lockdown easing looks pretty similar to Englandaposs on the whole. Like in England, Scots will be able to sunbathe in parks and open spaces, travel for exercise and be encouraged back to workthey canapost work from home. And golf, tennis, bowls and fishing will be allowed. But there are several crucial dferences in how the two countries will approach the easing of lockdown. Some measures will be more relaxed, but some will be tighter after the First Minister warned the danger of a second wave later in the year is very real indeed. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman welcomed todayaposs announcement and claimed it shows the UK-wide approach is working. We set out the road map a few weeks ago and now the devolved administrations are following that path at the right speed for them, he added. But as these five key dferences show, itaposs not just a case of follow-the-leader.also unveiled its lockdown last week, but we have concentrated on Scotlandaposs as it was announced today.. The dates and phasing of lockdown  ENGLAND: Lockdown is being eased in three steps - with target starting dates of May , June  and July  at the earliest. Step one is outdoor activity, step two is non-essential shops and schools, and step three is other shops, hospitality and places of worship or cinemas.SCOTLAND: Lockdown is being eased in four phases - with phase one starting on May . But crucially, the other phases donapost have a date and will only be decided when the evidence is right. Schools only go back in phase three, the same phase as pubs and museums.BOTH: Each phase wonapost all come at once, and will have apossub stagesapos of dferent things opening before moving on to the next stage.. How schools will reopen  ENGLAND: Primary schools and nurseries in England have been told to reopen from June  at the earliest, starting with all pupils in years R,  and . Years - would follow later in June. Secondary schools would remain shut until September, apart from limited transition sessions for Years  and .SCOTLAND: Staff willto schools from May  to prepare for changes, and help more children access critical childcare. There will also be support for children due to start P or S. But schools will only reopen from August , and only under a blended model of part-time in-school teaching and part-time in-home learning. All childcare providers would reopen from the same date.BOTH: Schools remain open for children most in need already, and when they reopen fully they will have social distancing in place. In England this includes half-sized classes, one-way corridors, removing toys and staggering break and start and finish times. ENGLAND: You can only meet onepersonfrom one other household at a time outdoors. There are no firm plans beyond this. The government is hoping to let two whole households join together in a permanent bubble to share childcare or reunite parents with children, but this isnapost confirmed.SCOTLAND: From May , twohouseholdscan meet outdoors. This means Scotland might scrap the two people maximum rule, suggesting two whole households of people could meet up. Itaposs still under consideration. In phase , people would then be able to meet with larger groups including family and friends outside with physical distancing. And in phase  larger groups could meet indoors - again with physical distancing.BOTH: Anyone who meets from two dferent households must still stay two metres apart. No hugs.. Meeting in your parentsapos garden  ENGLAND: If two households meet from May , it has to be in an outdoor open space - not a private garden.SCOTLAND: Two households can meet from May  not just in an open space, but also in a private garden.BOTH: Anyone who meets from two dferent households can only do so outdoors - and again must stay two metres apart."},{"url":null,"title":"brits continue flock beaches soak","story":"NewsBrits continue to flock to beaches to soak up the sun despite second wave fearsSeaside resorts and popular hotspots in England have reported a second day of heavy traffic and visitors as the warm weathercontinues on from yesterday being the hottest day of the yearShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video people-flock-beaches-across-uk-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news brits-continue-flock-beaches-soak-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Seaside resorts and popular hotspots in England have reported a second day of traffic jams and gridlock roads as the warm weather continues to attract visitors following yesterday being the hottest day of the year. The Met Office forecasts sunshine today, with a few light winds and a maximum temperature of C, after the nation enjoyed the hottest day of the year yesterday with temperatures hitting C. Last week Boris Johnson eased the lockdown which allowed day trips in England. However the public must practice social distancing so must stay two metres apart. Southend is experiencing a second day of visitors with a local councillor criticising the hundreds who travelled to the town’s beaches yesterday, claiming some were coming from “as far away as Manchester”. Matt Dent said that scenes like the packed crowds yesterday could lead to a second deadly spike, Essex Live reports. He said: The more I see of this, the more I fear weaposre in for a second wave.  It isnapost Southenders, itaposs people travelling from outside the borough - as far away as Manchester, from what Iaposve heard - who seem to think lockdown is lted, and Covid- is no longer a threat. As a councillor Iaposve had calls, messages, emails from people I represent who are frustrated that whilst they self-isolate and shield as theyaposve been advised to do, the whole crisis is being prolonged by this sort of foolishness. He added that he felt sorry for residents who didnapost have a garden but were too scared to head down to the beach. Officers in Ilfracombe and Braunton in Devon said they had identied vehicles from all over the country in the local area, where toilets and other amenities remain closed.  Roads towards the North Devon coast are now gridlocked, officers tweeted. We have vehicles from all over the country identied, please do not travel here. We will still be here when this is over so come back when itaposs safe to do so. Cornwall, also in Devon, is also experiencing a second day of people flocking to popular beaches in Newquay, St Ives and Portreath.  This follows a scene in Portreath yesterday described as aposcarnageapos by an enraged resident. Posting on Twitter she said: Absolute carnage at @polzeathbeach.. everyone getting stuck in the sand and the carpark totally full with more people trying to come in... this needs managing NOW!! DO NOT COME TO POLZEATH BEACH!! However in Newquay police targeted campervans that had come to the region and moved in the early hours this morning for breaking the lockdown rules by staying overnight. On Twitter at .am, police in Newquay said: We identied some visitors that had travelled to Newquay and stayed overnight against Public Health England advice and legislation.  With engagement, explanation and education they moved on. We love visitors to the town, #comebacklater. Andrea Davis, a councillor in Devon, is warning people that there are few facilities available for visitors in Woolacombe which became so congested that traffic wardens ran out of tickets to hand out for careless parking. She said: There is currently no leguard cover on the beach, the car parks are closed, the loos are closed, the shops and cafes are closed, so it makes sensepeople put off their visit until the county has had chance to re-open.”  The huge influx of visitors to Weston-super-Mare has prompted the townaposs Mayor to hit out at people for the lack of social distancing. Mayor Mark Cannord hit out at a complete disregard for the townaposs residents on BBC breakfast, saying: There was a complete disregard for the residents, complete disregard for the rest of the seafront, not taking any notice of proper queuing when they were trying to get something to drink or eat. A petition, started by Malcolm Pearcey, calling for day trips to be capped at a maximum of  miles has been signed by almost , people already. It says: The UK government has given the green light to unlimited travel to exercise within England.

Danny Lake was gutted when the lockdown meant he was unable to visit The Dockle Farmhouse in Swindon, to toast his milestone birthday. So instead -year-old Elise Richardson, transformed his dining room into the aposSpoons instead - even sourcing the same patterned carpet. Elise put the fake Wetherspoons together with help from her boyfriendaposs relatives at Dannyaposs parents home, where they both live, in Highworth, Wiltshire, She also created personalised paper plates while his uncle made a replica sign to hang above the door.  Lucky Danny was presented with a handmade burger cake complete with sides to finish his Wetherspoons meal on his birthday earlier this week. Elise even ensured Danny enjoyed bottomless drinks - including booze - that were included in the apospriceapos of his meal. She said: It was his st and we knew he wouldnapost be allowed out.  We asked him what he wanted to do and he said he really wanted to go to a Wetherspoons. Me and his parents though why donapost we throw him a Wetherspoons party and it got out of hand. The first thing we did was the paper plates, we were trying so hard to find actual Wetherspoons plates but we couldnapost find them anywhere.  But I found a company online where you could personalise paper plates, so I got a picture of the plate online and then just made them myself. Danaposs uncle managed to make the Wetherspoons sign thataposs outside and shipped it down to us which is amazing. Thataposs going to be around forever.  The backdrop and the carpet we got from a printing company and all the other little things we just bought online. Even his nan said she wouldnapost know that he wasnapost there. Danny said: I was speechless. Iaposd mentioned having a birthday at Wetherspoons as a joke but I didnapost think theyaposd take it seriously.

Troy House in Monmouth originates from the th century and the Grade II listed four storey dream home comes complete with a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, adding to an imposing portfolio of properties which also included Great Castle House in Monmouth and Badminton House in Gloucestershire. The estate was later converted into a convent school and then became a school, but as the condition of the buildings deteriorated the school moved locations in the s and the once grand manor has been left to rot.The , square-foot property has now been put up for auction, with a guide price of between £, and £, - but a look inside at just how dilapidated it has become suggests youaposll need far deeper pockets toit to its former glory.Listed by Allsop, it provides  bedrooms, four dormitories, a principalaposs flat, a staff flat, a caretakeraposs flat, a two storey hostel block, outbuildings and gargaing.The picturesque setting and grand exterior belie the true scale of the renovation job required, with photos of the interior showing floorboards and structures rotten through, with a huge clearance job needed to clear the abandoned school furniture. The description reads: The property is presented in a poor state of repair and requires extensive works of modernisation and refurbishment. The property may afford possible potential for redevelopment and or a number of alternative uses, subject to obtaining all necessary consents. If youaposre able to look beyond the current state of repair, the ultimate do-er upper does come with some incredible benefits, including sprawling land, original fittings and an estate that wouldnapost look out of place on Downton Abbey. Itaposs located a short journey from the historic market town of Monmouth, with both Cardf and Bristol city centres also accessible. With the Brecon Beacons National Park to the west and River Wye is to the east, you wonapost be short of idyllic viewsyou want a bit of a break from the DIY. Richard Adamson, partner and auctioneer at Allsop, said: Troy House has received a signicant amount of interest with over  enquiries regarding the property, in just over a week of coming to the market.

The swab test will be carried out in a number of AE departments, GP testing hubs and care homes across Hampshire at the first instance, the Department of Health said. The trial, which will last six weeks, comes amid criticisms people have been waiting days or weeks to get test results. But the new swap will be processed on-site rather than needing to be sent to a lab and tell someonethey have Covid- in  minutes. It could mean healthcare workers can, depending on the result,to a sht or isolate on the same day they take the test. This is dferent to the PCRtests which need to be processed at dferent temperatures meaning it takes longer to get results. Andthe pilot is successful the test, developed by UK manufacturer Optigene, will be rolled out more widely, the government said. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible Iniduals with symptoms will be prioritised for testing in AE departments and GP hubs but all staff and residents will be tested in care homes whether they are symptomatic or not. Hampshire Hospital NHS Trust, which is leading the trial, will work closely with local authorities to identy priority care homes to visit and test, the department added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: This new test could provide accurate results almost on the spot. This will enable health and care workers to carry on with their sht or immediately isolate on the same day, and could eventually offer the same benefit to the whole country.  This could change the way that we control Covid- across the country, getting those with negative results back into society as quickly as possible. I am hugely grateful for everyone in Hampshire for making this innovation possible. Trust chief executive Alex Whitfield said: We are tremendously excited to be able to support the governmentaposs efforts for ever more accessible, faster coronavirus testing.

The clip is filmed inside the car and shows the motorist speeding at almost three times the national mph speed limit. The driver, whose face is not shown, starts off on the inside lane at mph before he begins accelerating aggressively as their speed increases. Their left hand is seen throughout the footage gripping the steering wheel while their other hand is out of shot, presumably holding the camera. Within five seconds they have hit the mph before switching to the middle lane with mph showing on their speedometer. Two seconds later they switch to the fast lane and as they carry on accelerating the vehicle can be heard making a shrill noise. When they hit mph  seconds later the camera zooms into the dashboard and the clip ends a second later at mph.The clip has been watched more than , times and retweeted by , Twitter users after being posted on Twitter by @CrimeLdn with the caption aposSo crazy over mphapos followed by a scary face and shocked emoji.The clip also caught the attention of a twitter account belonging to Detective Superintendent Andy Cox who investigates fatal and serious road crashes and tackles transport network crime across London.He tweeted: Aware of this horric driving.

The ground-breaking method uses pictures of a person’s eyelids to assess the levels. Being able to perform one of the most common clinical lab tests without drawing blood could help reduce the need for in-person clinic visits. That would make it easier to remotely monitor critical patients and improve care in countries with limited access to testing laboratories. To take the measurement, the patient pulls down the inner eyelid to expose the small blood vessels underneath. A medic then uses a smartphone app created by the scientists to take pictures of the eyelids. Prof Young Kim, of Purdue University, Indiana, said: “Our new mobile health approach paves the way for bedside or remote testing of blood haemoglobin levels for detecting anaemia, acute kidney injury and haemorrhages, or for assessing blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia. The Covid- pandemic has greatly increased awareness of the need for expanded mobile health.” Professor Kim and colleagues from the University of Indianapolis, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in the US and Moi University School of Medicine in Kenya used software to transform a smartphone camera into a hyperspectral imager. The tool reliably measures haemoglobin levels - a measure of the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood - without the need for any hardware modications or accessories.  A pilot clinical test showed that prediction errors for the smartphone technique were within five to ten per cent of those measured with clinical laboratory blood. Professor Kim said: This new technology could be very useful for detecting anaemia, which is characterised by low levels of blood haemoglobin.

It was loved by the poet Lord Tennyson and, at low tide, it stretches almost to the horizon. It’s the eve of the late May Bank Holiday, the start of half-term, and Britain is baking under soaring temperatures. Yet the fairground is silent, the crazy golf is empty and there are no donkey rides along the sands. The local council has begged people to stay away, but by yesterday the beaches were filling up with visitors desperate to let their kids play in the sand. Nowhere is the terrible bind of this moment played out more than in Mablethorpe and its close neighbour Skegness, strung out along the same Lincolnshire coast. These towns desperately need visitors, yet also need them to stay away.  They are the two towns in the UK that economists project will be worst hit by economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.In communities where ‘summer pays for winter’, every day the towns remain closed, they are dying. Yet an influx of visitors would threaten the lives of thousands of local elderly people and lead to a second mid-season peak that could finish off coastal towns for good. Allison Stapleton and her husband Colin own Monty’s fish and chip shop in Mablethorpe. They sum up the dilemma. “At the end of the day our health is more important than a bag of chips,” Allison , says. “Butwe don’t get up and running soon, we will not survive the winter months and % of the Mablethorpe coast will not get through the winter.” The £, government grant they received is quickly being swallowed by rent and bills. “At the moment we have only opened the takeaway part of the shop for two days, Friday and Saturday,” Allison says.  “I usually hug some of our elderly ladies, and it was heartbreaking not to be able to when they came in.” For Daniel Goate, , who runs Poplar Farm Restaurant and Caravan Park on a few acres of the Lincolnshire Wolds in Skegness, the situation is even more acute. “The longer we are closed, the more money we are losing,” he says. “We are a seasonal business, but there’s no guarantee we can open this season, or next.” Even so – in contrast to some millionaires’ luxury businesses – he said Poplar Farm was hoping not to furlough anyone “to take the pressure off government”. In town, Sue Allen’s shop, Sue’s Curios and Collectables, a fixture in Mablethorpe since , has had to close its museum, but is just about surviving on internet orders.  This coast was struggling long before coronavirus, Mablethorpe being one of the towns Beeching cut off from the rail network in . Last year, a report from the End Child Poverty Coalition found child poverty running at % in several wards in Mablethorpe and Skegness. Last year, Skeggy was cruelly taunted as worse than North Korea by one travel website, and voted Britain’s fourth worst holiday destination by Which , infuriating locals. Now, the strain is visible. ­The ­Furnichurch charity supplies furniture to people in need and runs a food larder that has been delivering desperately needed parcels. In April last year it helped  people. This April that figure was . One of those was a single mum with four children who worked in a care home.  A patient of hers had died from coronavirus,” Dot McMillan, , the charity’s chairman, says. “She then had some symptoms which meant she had to self-isolate. The workplace only paid her for one week.Another man had lost his job and was waiting on his Universal Credit payments. At the same time, he was taking his we to hospital for chemo.The couple waited until their fridge was empty before they came to us for help.Dot says this coming week of hot weather in half-term will be a “real test” for Mablethorpe. “Many of the local people here are worried about seeing an influx because we have all been very good at social distancing,” she says.“I think the Government advice should have been to tell people to stay at home another three weeks.” The Centre for Towns and the University of Southampton came up with their list of worst affected places after calculating the proportion of each town’s population employed in industries temporarily shut down by Covid-. They ranked Mablethorpe first, then Skegness, Clacton-on-Sea, Bridlington and Kinmel Bay, near Rhyl. All are coastal towns already struggling – and all have a Conservative MP.

Tilly Lockey, , was determined to prove a physiotherapist wrong after she said she would never master it. Tilly said she also wanted to inspire others to achieve their own “impossible” dreams.Mum Sarah was so angry at the physiotherapist’s comment, she went on eBay and bought a piano.But the talented teenager was always too busy to explore her musical side – until the Covid- lockdown. Now the schoolgirl uses a prosthetic – known as “the rake”, as it has prongs held together with tape. She plays basic three-note chords with that and her “elbow” to play single notes. Tilly, of Consett, County Durham, said: “Everyone will say that playing the piano with no hands is impossible.  “Well I’m doing it.

The use of a mask or face covering should not be seen as a substitute for social distancing, the statement read. Please continue to observe rules regarding appropriate distancing while on Costco premises.  The rule was met criticism among some shoppers who took to social media to slam the move.aposI will not comply with your mask rule!,apos one person posted on Twitter.Others blasted the move an abuse of power.  You have hit a new low... you are an American corporation with an obligation to support our American values, dictating face mask for your workers is one thing but forcing this on your loyal members who paid for a membership is a complete abuse of power, one man wrote.

She explained that because she was walking through the woods in flip-flops the dress got ripped and muddy. Emma said: There was no point in putting it to the back of my wardrobe to rot.

Patrons of the Kichiri Shinjuku, a traditional Japanese-style pub known as an izakaya, are sprayed with the disinfecting mist at the entrance. Spokeswoman Rieko Matsunaga said: We want customers to feel safe when they come inside. This is geared to promote social distancing and prevent infections. As customers arrive to the pub they are greeted by a hostess on a screen, who advises them they must wash their hands. They then have their temperature taken with a thermometer before walking through an airport-style security scanner where they are sprayed for  seconds. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Next, customers pickup a map which outlines where they can sit in the venue. They then scan a QR code on their phones which brings up a menu and allows them to order. Diners must also sit apart from one another and are protected by plastic screens. The pub is owned by Kichiro  Co, which has  locations across Japan. The company first installed the machine at its Shinjuku branch on May , saying they are hopeful about expanding the system and possibly working with other venues.Matsunaga told CNN : We set it up to abide by new lestyle guidelines. Weaposd like to spread this technology and collaborate with other restaurants. However, despite their new entrance policy, the World Health Organisationstrongly advises against using any form of spray disinfectant on a person. In an advisory published on Saturday, the WHO said: Spraying disinfectants can result in risks to the eyes, respiratory or skin irritation and the resulting health effects.

You never know, we may even have cup draws coming soon!I must say, however, I feel the SPFL’s stated aim of kicking off the new campaign at that time –August  for league football – is hopeful rather than one they expect to pull off. There is a whole lot of work to be done to prove to the government football matches can be staged safely.Now, the Premiership clubs have given themselves some space to think about how to restart football with a new campaign.It’s the only sensible option.Clubs now know what ision they are going to be in and there can be some tentative plans put in place to move forward.That’s a step in the right direction.Dundee now know they’ll have to fend off Heartsthey want to win the Championship and can budget for the year ahead knowing who they will be playing.Whether there are fans in attendance, we’ll have to wait and see.The good thing is, it feels like our game is finally moving forward.The past couple of weeks have seen both Dundee and Dundee United start to reshape their squads for next season.Neither are yet in a position to start signing new players, of course, but there are some hints of what is to come at both clubs.United released a few boys at the end of their contracts – Paul Watson, Rakish Bingham and Osman Sow among them.It’s not a clearout or anything but I think we should expect a number of new faces at Tannadice once some sort of normality reappears.With Watson going, they evidently have a new centre-back in mind.I’d expect them to strengthen the spine of the team, adding a central midfielder and a striker to compete with Lawrence Shankland and Nicky Clark.At Dundee, I only expect a handful of new faces.A striker to partner Kane Hemmings is a certainty while maybe another wide attacker and central midfielder will arrive.What happens with Christophe Berra we will have to wait and see. Hearts might not be too happy with Dundee right now#IT was refreshing to see a bit of live football on the TV over the weekend with the Bundesliga kicking off again.It might not have been what we are used to with no fans, masked subs and someDortmund#s Erling Haaland showing a pandemic still can’t stop him.Germany is leading the way on how to get the game back – problem is I don’t see any other country being able to do it as safely as the Germans.I’M no basketball fan but watching the Last Dance on Netflix certainly made me think about becoming one!Remarkable series on the s Chicago Bulls and the great Michael Jordan.Get it watched!SPFL call   Premiership season with Celtic crowned champions, Hearts relegated and St Johnstone landing top-six finish\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp spfl-premiership-celtic-hearts-st-johnstone embed # secretjwBrECgV\" data-secret\"jwBrECgV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/4696595-1-815x564.jpg ","title":"lee wilkie i am all for reconstruction but now is not the time","story":"I’ve been hugely in favour of league reconstruction for a long time. However, I’m getting the sneaking feeling now just isn’t the right time.That might come as a surprise to people who have read this column over the past few weeks andIt seems like we are slowly moving toward the game eventually restarting.Yesterday’s announcement of the Premiership being called with Celtic champions and Hearts relegated came as no surprise.There was no other credible option.The Jambos will, obviously, feel aggrieved and so will some Rangers fans but it is the right call.I said from the start of the shutdown that reconstruction is the only way to ensure no club is unduly affected by leagues ending early.And I still stand by that.However, the situation we are in now a couple of months down the line leads me to pause for thought.Clubs are in such dire straits right now, nobody really knows how many might go to the wall before the game restarts.If we’ve already agreed reconstruction and, say, five clubs go under, we have to start the whole process over again.The decision-makers in the game have shown over the past few farcical weeks that there’s a realI can see where the Premiership clubs were coming from when they canned the revamp talks  days ago.It looks like a mammoth job to get football back on the pitch sometime soon, eventhe SPFL are planning to restart again in July.With that in mind, I’d prefer reconstruction talks were put on the back burner – not binned, by any means – and talked about in a measured fashion over the next few months.Start the new season as normal – eventhings have to wait a few weeks to get the green light – and then get a plan in place for the season after.That way, the new set-up comes from a foundation of stability rather than the uncertainty the game is surrounded by right now and what the future might hold.At the very least, clubs can now plan for the season ahead, knowing who they will be facing eventhere are still doubts around.The big thing for all clubs is getting that stability back, that certainty to then plan ahead.It feels like that’s coming – once it’s back, start talking reconstruction to improve our game in the long-term.I felt for a couple of my old team-mates who were released by their clubs over the weekend.The coronavirus pandemic is obviously a dficult time for everybody but being without a job through it is horrible.Particularly when there’s no prospect right now of finding another employer.With football clubs unable to make moves in the transfer market because of the shutdown, that leaves players like Danny Swanson and Craig Conway in limbo.Normally, I’d expect them to have plenty of offers to think over this summer.Swansonis one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen in training.He was superb at Tannadice.He obviously hasn’t played so much at St Johnstone for whatever reason, leading to his departure.Conway, meanwhile, has had a really successful career since leaving United.He was always such a fit guy and a great lad to have in the dressing-room, he’d normally find a new club no problem.Right now, though, nobody knows what will happen.I was pleased to see Dundee say they were extending some contracts.Christie Elliott’s for another year, a clause he had in his deal, and Paul McGowan, Josh Meekings and Tom Field till July. Even though that’s just a few weeks, it sends the right message – that they are going to look after players.I don’t imagine every club will be doing that.A lot of players will have a stressful summer coming up with no club able to sign them.Theof football with the Bundesliga starting at the weekend was very much a step in the right direction for me.It might have been a bit strange without the crowds but needs must.

sheds light on trust","story":"Researchers at Aberdeen University have conducted a study with twins to understand what makes some of us trust more readily than others.The new research was a collaboration between experts at Aberdeen University and the University of Western in Australia.The study discovered that who we inidually trust is mostly a product of our inidual le experience, rather than either nature or nurture.Researchers studied , twins to understand whether dferences in trust are based on genetic, shared or personal environments.They showed the twins images of faces and asked them to rate how trustworthy, attractive and dominant each face was.Dr Clare Sutherland, a senior lecturer at Aberdeen University, said: “We think that as we go about our lives we learn who looks trustworthy to us based on specic social interactions we have with others.#So, for example,I experience particularly trustworthy interactions with people with green eyes, whereas you experience particularly trustworthy interactions with people with feminine features, then I might learn to specically trust people with green eyes and you might learn to specically trust feminine features.#The findings are new as most research on first impressions of trust, focuses on what we have in common, instead of looking at why we disagree.According to researchers, face impressions of trust haven#t been studied in this way before.She added: “Previous research has found that inidual dferences in face identity recognition are strongly driven by genes, which offers a sharp contrast to the current work.#It suggests that the cognitive architecture of face perception is more complex than perhaps we might have thought.“Our study sheds new light into the origins of a critical aspect of human social cognition – and tells us about everyday trusting experience in society.#As our online worlds grow increasingly fragmented, especially in these troubled times, our results suggest that disagreements in trust will also grow.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

have been observed circling Glasgow as well as making brief landings during \"touch and go\" manoeuvres designed to practice these tricky and sometimes risky touchdowns.In wartime, some planes have to

fly on essential, but routine training missions around the United Kingdom.\"The C- and A in particular fly quite low-level profiles, and on operations they will be used to land in areas where there

apps like FlightRadar.Occasionally, the military planes have been observed performing strange-looking manoeuvres such as flying around in circles .The RAF said these odd flight patterns have a clear explanation: the aircraft were involved in mid-air refuelling.For the last three weeks RAF Lossiemouth has been involved in night flying exercise which concluded on Friday, May  involving Typhoon jets.\"During our night flying window, we launched our first set of sorties around ,\" the spokesman added.\"This meant we were able to generate two or three training serials a day ndash two in

The test looks for antibodies which could help indicate whether a person has developed some immunity against the virus.As it is able to detect  per cent of cases where a person has had coronavirus in the past, the test could prove useful in helping to inform when lockdown restrictions may be safe to ease.The Department of Health and Social Caresaid it is exploring the use of antibody testing across the NHS in England, and later the wider public.DHSC said it was delighted that devices were progressing through validation and is working on plans to roll out antibody testing, adding that an announcement will be made ldquoin due course.Health officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions about testing, but are likely to roll out the antibody testEngland adopts it."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-testing-site-operating-former-power-station","story":"Army personnel can be seen carrying out tests while wearing masks as they welcome key workers and family members who received appointments to attend.The mobile unit is using the former Cockenzie Power Station site as one of several bases across Scotland which it will visit as additional testing is carried out by the UK Government.It opened yesterday with a \"Covid Testing\" sign at the entrance to the site.Imagesshow a team of military staff on the site carrying out testing through vehicle windows at the drive through centre.The st Infantry Brigade, which oversees army reserves in Scotland, are running the mobile unit.The mobile units are providing additional testing capacity to the NHS which continues to focus on testing hospital and social care workers.It is hoped the mobile units will be able to offer tests to other key workers and their families from a wider range of identied essential services including those working in the third sector and volunteer care helpers.The unit willto Cockenzie in two weeks time as part of the national testing programme"},{"url":null,"title":"leuchie-house-toasts-superb-inspection-results","story":"Following an unannounced inspection in January, the Care Inspectorate awarded Leuchie House the highest possible score in four categories and the second highest in a fth.The categories were: quality of care and support quality of staffing quality of leadership how well peoplersquos wellbeing is supported and quality of setting.The report said: ldquoGuests experienced respectful and compassionate care at each stage of their interaction with the service.

the real reason why its aircraft have been seen across Scotland.The most noticeable planes to have been spotted recently launched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.These large aircraft have been observed circling Glasgow as well as making brief landings during \"touch and go\" manoeuvres designed to practice these tricky and sometimes risky touchdowns.In wartime, some planes have to make landings on rough terrain, so its imperative that pilots are as well-practised as possible.\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is an Airbus AM Atlas, the type of airfact seen over Glasgow in recent weeks \" class\"editor-image\"This is an Airbus AM Atlas, the type of airfact seen over Glasgow in recent weeks A spokesman for RAF Lossiemouth told The Herald:\"Due to the lockdown, the public have become more aware and interested in these activities.\"To be clear, these were all occurring prior to the pandemic. But a lack of civil aviation now makes them stand out more.\"Many of the larger aircraft based out of RAF Brize Norton, such as the C- Hercules, AM Atlas, A-MRTT Voyager, and C- Globemaster regularly fly on essential, but routine training missions around the United Kingdom.\"The C- and A in particular fly quite low-level profiles, and on operations they will be used to land in areas where there are not established runway surfaces.\"This can include landing on beaches, for example.\"The quiet skies have made it easier to spot military planes, which can sometimes be identied and followed using apps like FlightRadar.Occasionally, the military planes have been observed performing strange-looking manoeuvres such as flying around in circles .The RAF said these odd flight patterns have a clear explanation: the aircraft were involved in mid-air refuelling.For the last three weeks RAF Lossiemouth has been involved in night flying exercise which concluded on Friday, May  involving Typhoon jets.\"During our night flying window, we launched our first set of sorties around ,\" the spokesman added.\"This meant we were able to generate two or three training serials a day ndash two in daylight, and one in low-light conditions.\"The Typhoon is a multi-role aircraft, which means itrsquos able to conduct a number of dferent missions while in the air air-to-air and air-to-ground manoeuvres to name two.\"To enable our Typhoons to stay on task for longer and travel larger distances, we are often supported by Voyagers ndash the RAFrsquos air-to-air refuelling aircraft based at RAF Brize Norton.\"These Voyager aircraft will fly lsquoracetracks in the skyrsquo, and are usually visible on flight tracking websites which pick up ADS-B.\"In the United Kingdom, live-armed Typhoons are on \"constant standby to react against unidentied aircraft approaching UK airspace as well as aircraft that are operating in an unusual manner, which may pose a threat\".Typhoons are often scrambled on \"Quick Reaction Alert\" missions to intercept planes which enter British airspace\"Our last intercept was against two Bear-F ndash Russian Maritime Patrol Aircraft on April ,\" the spokesman said.\"Additionally the Typhoon Force are involved in NATO Air Policing missions, such as Op AZOTIZE in Lithuania where  Squadron deployed a few weeks ago.\"Typhoons have also been involved in strikes against Daesh.\"A Typhoon jetIf youre worried by the sudden appearance of a military aeroplane, you can generally find out what its up to by visiting offical Twitter accounts or the RAF website.\"The RAF has always been open about its operations and exercises,\" the spokesman continued.\"With the public now spending more time at home, many have taken to their gardens or spent more time on their phones.\"They have also become more acutely aware of the noises above their houses, and wersquove seen a signicant increase in interest in routine, but essential flying as a result.\"When we do launch Quick Reaction Alert, wherever possible we publish information as to who we intercepted, what the aircraft were doing, why the interception was carried out, roughly where it all happened, and we aim to answer as many questions we can whilst maintaining operational security.\"Itrsquos vital that the public understand why this activity is essential to the defence of the

We have used this approach many times in affordable housing schemes.\"The committee approved the plans lodged by Springfield Properties as part of the affordable phase of a larger development at Windygoul South where it is expected around  homes will be built.Members were told the  new properties housing would be taken on by the council once built.They will be builtin the north eastern part of the wider Windygoul South site, in an area bounded to the west by woodland and existing housingon George Grieve Way.Councillor Colin McGinn, ward member for Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry, welcomed the addition of affordable housing but raised concerns about the impact of additional traffic on the town centre.He called for the council to look at bringing forward proposals for a Tranent bypass, which has been discussed in the past.Mr McGinn said: \"I believe now is the time to look at the bypass.\""},{"url":null,"title":"british-gas-customers-can-get-five-days-electricity-free","story":"Who is eligible for the offer The offer is only available to those who are part of the British Gas loyalty scheme, which is available to all energy customers.Launched in , the scheme provides customers with ious discounts on restaurants and days out, along with prize draws for live entertainment and holidays.Customers can receive up to  free energy days per year through the loyalty scheme, with the amount depending on how long they have been with the supplier.At the moment, British Gas is offering five extra days completely free, as customers are spending more time at home due to coronavirus, and increasing their energy usage as a result. However, customers cannot choose which five days to get free themselves.Instead, British Gas will take an average daily price for your energy usage per month and deduct that amount from your next bill.The value of the free electricity is dependent on an inidual customersrsquo average consumption and tarf prices.According to government figures, the average monthly electricity bill cost almost pound per month in , meaning customers would save roughly pound by claiming the offer from British Gas.But the freebie will come as a welcome reprieve for many, with energy bills having climbed by pound per month during the UK lockdown.How do I claim it To claim the five free energy days, you need to sign up to British Gas Rewards.This can be done via the British Gas website, or through your online account.Once you have signed up, simply select the list of available offers and claim the free energy days.If you are already a rewards user, be sure to claim the offer before it expires on May .Should I still be working from home If your electricity bill has been climbing due to working from home, you will still have to deal with the added expense for a while longer.Despite lockdown restrictions slowly starting to ease in some parts of the UK, the government has advised workers to continue working from home wherever possible.This is to help minimise the number of social contacts across the country, thereby keeping transmissions as low as possible.Workers in England who are unable to work from home can now travel to work,their workplace is open.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig.

There are trials under way in Scottish councils.Most fans of UBI regard themselves as being on the left, like Barack Obama and Yanis Varoufakis. However, the idea has a long history on the right.The famous Alaskan scheme, the Permanent Fund Dividend , was introduced by a Republican Governor, Jay Hammond, in . The recently-completed UBI experiment in Finland was initiated by a right-wing government which included the True Finns in .Now, Irsquom not playing the Twitter game here of guilt by association. An idea can be worthwhile no matter who supports it. However, it is not an accident that UBI is attractive to tech plutocrats and small state visionaries.To those on the left, UBI seems like an exercise in humane wealth redistribution, and to a certain extent it is. But those on the right see it very dferently: as a means of undermining the big state. Citizenrsquos income becomes a lever against spending policies.In Alaska, the Independent Democrat governor, Bill Walker, recently tried to reduce the PFD in order to improve education funding. Last year he was defeated by the Republican Mike Dunleavy who promised instead to double the UBI, and cut public spending in the state by pound. billion.Public services being sacriced in order to put more free money into peoplesrsquo pockets isnrsquot quite what advocates of UBI envisage.

An idea can be worthwhile no matter who supports it. However, it is not an accident that UBI is attractive to tech plutocrats and small state visionaries.To those on the left, UBI seems like an exercise in humane wealth redistribution, and to a certain extent it is.

Citizenrsquos income becomes a lever against spending policies.In Alaska, the Independent Democrat governor, Bill Walker, recently tried to reduce the PFD in order to improve education funding.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed.

Thatrsquos a slightly dferent journey to those on the London Underground ndash where ordinary folk packed into carriages after Boris Johnson said people who cannot work from home should get back in the harness. Johnson also blithely said workers should avoid public transport. As the packed tube trains show, not everyone can afford to own a car, or live in the centre of city so they can walk or cycle to work.Grant Shapps, Tory transport secretary, says he wouldnrsquot travel by bus or train, and claims itrsquos a ldquocivic duty to avoid public transport. It isnrsquot a civic duty to die because of government stupidity. Deaths among transport workers are mounting. The arrogance of wealth is becoming as sickening as the virus itself.Itrsquos not just the low-paid who are victims of this gross inequality ndash the average white collar worker is just as vulnerable. In England, teachers are under pressure to get back into the classroom despite no guarantees for their safety.All this, while the UK government pushes through anti-immigration legislation, as migrant workers keep us alive in hospitals. We clap for our NHS workers today, while preparing to kick them out tomorrow.The disabled are being laid off, funding for the homeless during coronavirus is now drying up, food banks canrsquot cope with demand.This disregard for the lives and dignity of ordinary workers is in the DNA of our society. What was once called a personnel department is now human resources. Wersquore resources, commodities, no better than tins of dog food.Every tale now is one of the rich against the poor.

Every board should have half of its membership elected from the workforce. That way shareholder greed can be curbed, lay-offs prevented where theyrsquore unnecessary, pay fairly apportioned, rights protected, staff respected.Other countries do this to a limited extent and their economies havenrsquot tanked like ours. Unemployment in the UK is likely to hit over  per cent.

What happened was that, during a News at Ten programme, Ms Smith said Nicola Sturgeon had ldquoenjoyed the opportunity to set out her own lockdown rules and not have to follow whatrsquos happening in England and other parts of the UK.But the First Minister took umbrage at this. ldquoNever in my entire political career have I lsquoenjoyedrsquo anything less than this, she said. ldquoMy heart breaks every day for all those who have lost loved ones to this virus. Which prompted Ms Smith to try to clary things: ldquoI had meant to say hellip she has lsquoembracedrsquo the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyedrsquo by mistake.Now, I have no idea what Ms Smithrsquos political opinions are, but there are a few things worth saying about the original news report and the First Ministerrsquos response to it because they reveal quite a bit about the BBC, the SNP, and the relationship between politics and journalism.First, the news report. The problem with reports of this kind in which broadcasters are asked to analyse the dayrsquos events is that theyrsquore trying to do an almost impossible job: analyse whatrsquos going on while appearing to be totally factual and unbiased: in other words, express an opinion without appearing to express an opinion.But the premise is flawed. Sarah Smith. Me. You. We are not unbiased. As soon as a journalist decides to cover one story or another ndash or use one word or another ndash they are being influenced by unconscious bias. Ms Smith was also self-evidently not giving us untainted facts, she was expressing an opinion and it would helpthe BBC used the right word for it ndash opinion ndash and stopped acting, in its rather hoighty-toighty way, like itrsquos completely unbiased. It isnrsquot: it seeks to control bias, which is a totally dferent thing.But as well as defending Sarah Smith, Irsquod also like to make an appeal to the First Minister here, because her response leaves a lot to be desired. First, her tweet was doing a thing that journalists get a lot: responding with how-dare-you horror to something you havenrsquot actually said. Ms Smith was suggesting the First Minister was enjoying, or embracing, the political elements of the crisis, not the personal consequences for the victims, and it was unfair of Ms Sturgeon to suggest otherwise with talk of loved ones and broken hearts.Ms Sturgeon also needs to be careful about the pot she stirs. I was talking to a colleague recently who told me that hersquod been seeing a therapist because of the vilication and mockery hersquod received from SNP supporters, including ministers, and the effect that it had on his self-confidence. You might say: \"If you dish it out, you gotta take it\", but all I would say to senior SNP politicians, including the First Minister, is: before you single out a journalist, take a look behind you at the snarly hordes you are about to unleash and encourage.The other problem with tweets like the First Ministerrsquos is that they encourage something  thatrsquos troubling: a belief among some of her supporters that the BBC is institutionally anti-independence. The BBC is like any other large organisation in Scotland: there are people in it who believe in independence and there are people who donrsquot, and it does at least have rules that seek impartiality. But, in tweet after tweet, its critics accuse it of being anti-independence and the result is what psychologists call an availability cascade: a belief that grows because of the number of people saying it.The cascade also has another curious effect. SNP supporters who believe the BBC is biased against independence have boycotted its coverage. For them, this preserves the cascade, but the problem for the BBC is that other viewers ndash unionists, left-wingers, right-wingers ndash are doing the same thing for dferent reasons.Which leads us back to poor Sarah Smith standing there with a microphone trying to navigate it all and appear neutral. What shersquos saying to us is: ldquoTrust me, Irsquom a journalist ndash a neutral, unbiased BBC journalist. But perhaps the BBC could be more honest about whatrsquos really going on: she is expressing an opinion. And perhaps, when she hears the opinion, the First Minister could try to be a little less touchy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

lting restrictions, with some rules likely to be loosened within days of the next formal lockdown review on May .Initial steps are expected to include allowing golf and fishing, opening garden centres and allowing Scots to meet up outdoors with someone from outside their household.Last night, Ms Sturgeon said each phase will be assessed every three weeks, suggesting the route map will run until at least August .Reports previously indicated schools could reopen on a part-time basis from August , with teachers heading back next month in preparation.It came as Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw accused Ms Sturgeon of multiple failures in tackling the virus, including keeping an early outbreak secret from the public.He said the First Minister had ducked responsibility over a decision not to publicise an outbreak at a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February.Speaking at First Ministers Questions, Mr Carlaw said adequate contact tracing following the event, in which  people

However, having antibodies does not automatically mean a person will not pass the virus onto somebody .Mr Hancock revealed data that showed around one in six people in London and one in  where in England had already had the coronavirus.Information gathered from an antibody surveillance study led by the Office for National Statistics suggested  per cent of people in London, around . million, and around % in England, some .m people, had tested positive for antibodies to coronavirus.At the No  briefing, Mr Hancock said certicates were being looked at for people who tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.\"Its not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring.

Forcing MPs to choose between the safety of our communities and equal representation is unacceptable.“Parliament must be a forum where every part of the United Kingdom can participate equally. The Secretary of State knows this better than most and the challenges posed to communities that are more distant from parliament. We are calling on him to be a voice for equal representation in government.”Mr Jack was questioned on the issue in parliament yesterday, by SNP MP Allan Dorans. Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family. I do not see why we cannot have proper scrutiny of parliament when we have the virtual proceedings, which work for some, but for me it is absolutely about being here, being scrutinised and being at the Dispatch Box.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL#s modernisation plans would see air traffic control operations at a five airports, including Kirkwall Airport, centralised to a control centre in Inverness, using remote tower technology.Speaking last week, councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of OIC#s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said:“We need to fully understand the impact on our community before any decision is made to create a remote air traffic control centre in Inverness.”“So it is disappointing that the government and HIAL have disregarded a call by this council, and others, for them to undertake an Islands Impact Assessment before by moving ahead with their plans.“We asked for this earlier in the year and expected the assessment to be completed before HIAL began to undertake a procurement process.”Councillor Sinclair added: “An immense amount of work was undertaken before the passing of the IslandsAct to ensure that Islands Impact Assessments would be carried out to give communities like ours a say when major changes such as this are proposed.“This appears to have been ignored on this occasion, which is why we are asking for the process to be paused until an assessment is undertaken.”HIAL#s position is that impact assessment is being carried out. Spokesman said: “An island impact assessment is currently underway and is being undertaken by an independent consultant. This will include consultation with local authorities and community groups. It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme. This technology will help deliver sustainable aviation connectivity and deliver a flexible, resilient air traffic service that will be highly adaptable as we ensure our airports are fit for the future.“The procurement process for such tenders is a y process We anticipate that the process to procure the remote tower technology solution will be completed by December  January .“We have reviewed our capital programme to allow us to implement key projects, and have other projects shelf-ready for when we are able toto some semblance of normality.

For those isles without shops, residents will receive a direct payment instead.“Our aim is to recognise the vital role isles shops play at the heart of their communities – and to provide some support for the residents they serve,” said James Stockan, Council Leader and Councillor for Stromness and the South Isles.“There’s been positive feedback from many folk in the isles over recent weeks and I hope this extension to the scheme will be welcomed.”The cost of the vouchers over the eight-weeks period will be approximately £,, which will slightly exceed the £, Food Fund funding allocation the Council received from the Scottish Government.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

a new and continuous cough or a high temperature # are being reminded to isolate themselves for seven days.Anyone  in a household where someone has symptoms should still isolate for  days.England says thank you, Boris. #You can now sunbath!#. Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters.

This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: .."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK.

With these, on Friday th May, pupils took part in three virtual quizzes, via Google Meet, one each for nursery, P- and P-.During the summer term at school, the pupils would normally take part in a fundraising event.Teachers linked this with the quiz and asked for a donation to charity in order to take part.

Others were and remain in the accountable control of local government.Even when the larger British utilities were privatised during the s and s, which was the equivalent of the Conservative Party giving its friends in big business a licence to print money, their unique importance was recognised by the simultaneous establishment of independent watchdogs such as Ofgem and Ofcom # the second of which has, through the telephone network, a vague and ill-defined authority over the internet.That vagueness should be claried that definition should be made in no uncertain terms.Nobody made the internet an essential utility.It has become one by popular consensus.Now that it is no longer a recreational luxury, but a basic necessity for any full member of our st century society, it must be made affordable and properly accessible in every corner of the land.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3121081.jpg--.jpg?1589361498000\n","title":"pipe band pays tribute to chairman","story":"Broughshane  District Pipe band are deeply saddened at the sudden death of their esteemed chairman and friend Robert Montgomery.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly.

Duane Farrell, CEO of relationship counselling service Relate NI, has said anxieties around money, childcare and living space are all putting stress on couples and households as lockdown continues. He said as traditional forms of support for households, such as receiving health visitors, fall away, families are looking for support for their relationships. Speaking to the BelfastCoronavirus podcast, he said: Our relationships are an essential part of our health and our wellbeing at this time, and sometimes when there are challenges, that can also affect our health and wellbeing. It#s a perfect storm that households are experiencing at the moment - increases in worries about finances as people are furloughed or let go from their jobs, really close proximity, people will have a whole host of things that take up their week and they have all disappeared.It#s led to people relying much more on other family members for support - which can sometimes expose cracks in relationships, he said.

Any existing tensions that there are in a relationship are being brought sharply into focus during lockdown in these last two months, even where relationships have previously been really strong. There are new challenges being faced because of the pressure people are under.

You#re trying to take out those opportunities for conflict.

Credit:Steve Parsons PA WireMark BainTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA contact tracing programme involving all confirmed positive cases of Covid- has started in Northern Ireland.The region has become the first of the four devolved nations to launch the plan, with all new positive cases now being traced.Finding all the people someone has been in contact with once they have tested positive for Covid- is seen as a key part in preventing the spread of the disease, according to the Public Health Agency .“This is another example of the herculean work right across the HSC system to fight back against Covid- and keep people safe,” said Health Minister Robin Swann.“The battle against the virus is a long-term challenge and contact tracing will have a very important role as part of that.”Dr Jackie Hyland, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA, said contact tracing at this stage involves new ways of working given the scale and the fact that new evidence is continually emerging about the illness.“We have teamed up with colleagues in the university sector and Health and Social Care Trusts to put in place all the necessary logistics,” he said.“We are now rolling out contact tracing further and working with the public to support people who may have been exposed so they can get tested and self-isolate to help prevent spread of infection.“We are progressing our plans for scaling up the second phase of the Northern Ireland contact tracing service, informed by the learning from the current pilot programme. This work involves testing all aspects of the programme.“From May  we have been undertaking contact tracing for all confirmed positive cases of Covid-.“Testing is also now available to everyone in Northern Ireland aged over five with symptoms, which will form an important part of the contact tracing programme.“The number of staff currently required changes each day in line with workload, but we have sufficient staff trained and available to manage contact tracing and meet demand.”The Department of Health is also taking forward work around digital solutions that can support the wider contact tracing programme when it goes live.The land border with the Republic of Ireland is an important factor in the spread of infectious diseases and therefore contact tracing.There are well-established systems in place to work with colleagues in the Republic on contact tracing and management of infectious diseases, and the health service is working at pace to develop new, more efficient ways of working collaboratively to reduce the spread of Covid-, and help protect cross-border travellers.For now contact tracing is being carried out exclusively by telephone and in a similar manner to the method used at beginning of the pandemic.“Our very first case was an inidual who landed in Dublin Airport then travelled to Northern Ireland back to their home and we saw the Public Health Agency and the Health Service Executive actually working together to do that contact tracing, so we’re taking that approach to begin with,” the Health Minister said.Mr Swann said he had spoken to his counterpart in the Republic, Simon Harris, on Tuesday morning regarding the development of a contact tracing app and he was also monitoring progress on digital technology within the NHS.“We’re still looking to see which will be the best fit for Northern Ireland,” he said, adding that two apps could be used in Northern Ireland until a bespoke app could be created.He had previously said that his preference would be for a single app which would work across the British Isles, butdferent apps were used they would be compatible.Contact tracing was suspended in Northern Ireland in mid-March. A pilot programme resumed on April  and Mr Swann said he expected the contact tracing service to be in place “for the next year at a minimum”.The Executive, guided by health experts, now believes the focus on contact tracing can help limit any impact of a second wave of Covid-.On Tuesday evening, a virtual meeting to discuss the ongoing response to coronavirus on both sides of the border took place between Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, the First and Deputy First Ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, Tanaiste Simon Coveney and the two health ministers.In a joint statement, Mr Coveney and Mr Lewis said they discussed the respective plans for emerging from lockdown “given the importance of implementing consistent approaches wherever possible and strong collaborative arrangements”.“Strong data-sharing arrangements North South would be a necessary part of the easing of restrictions,” they said.What is contact tracing Contact tracing aims to identy and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus.The process starts with someone who has been tested positive for Covid- being asked to list all the people they’ve recently been in prolonged contact with.A contact tracing team member will then phone these contacts and talk to them about their risk of infection. Everyone who has the infection and who is a close contact will have to self-isolate. To be successful in contact tracing people need to provide their phone number when they get a test.Why is it important Contact tracing has been credited with helping to lt restrictions in other countries, like South Korea, when combined with stringent testing measures.The most important element is speed.The five-stage process — sampling, testing, communication to a positive case, contact tracing and contact quarantine — all needs to be done in a -hour window to be effective in preventing spread.Why was it halted Contact tracing was halted by the UK government on March , though that proved to be a controversial move as many experts believed it was key to slowing the spread of the virus. The government was subsequently accused of not having the capacity to run it effectively.On April  the Department of Health in Northern Ireland restarted an ‘enhanced contact tracing pilot’, which, it says, is now operating five days a week. It’s felt by the Executive that it could prove crucial in limiting the impact of any second wave of coronavirus.That service is set to be expanded to operate over seven days soon.How does it operate in Northern Ireland For now, Northern Ireland is relying on telephone contact, but the speed of the process should increase dramaticallya mobile phone app becomes available.The process is off to a slow start and on May  the Health Minister said  staff were trained and working on contact tracing. On that date there were said to be  more tracers in training with a further  volunteers having come forward to join the list.In April Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride had said he estimated  to  staff would be needed for contact tracing to work efficiently.Is a contact tracing app likely to be used The development of an app to speed up the process of contact tracing is seen as key to maximising the impact of the scheme, but that has raised questions over whether Northern Ireland should be involved with the UK or on an all-Ireland basis.At the moment the UK and Irish governments are working on separate apps, but Health Minister Robin Swann said no decision has yet been made on the best way to proceed.The app would be able to identy people the patient may not know — like fellow passengers they have been in contact with on public transport or in supermarkets.But there have been concerns about privacy, particularly in Northern Ireland where security workers who may be reluctant to use it over fears their personal details could be compromised.Should contact tracing be organised on an all-Ireland basis Addressing media earlier this week, the Health Minister insisted there needed to be “a clarity of message”.And while a single app that works across both the UK and the Republic of Ireland would be the best solution for Northern Ireland, the logistics of that are proving problematic. Northern Ireland might have to settle for a compromise,it can be agreed, that would see UK app compatible with one in the Republic, arranged as part of the memorandum of understanding between authorities north and south of the border.Since Ireland is one geographical area, andcontact tracing is to be a long term project, then it makes sense to have an all-island approach.Is this likely to be a long term project The NI Executive has maintained that contact tracing is a crucial component for ending the lockdown, and that wider surveillance of the virus in the community is necessary.The system is expected to be in place for at least a year, possibly longer.

He warned that schools could not be the same as before the pandemic.It#s too early to say how particular measures will work out but we want to bring people along with us and talk to the experts both in schools, and indeed the wider medical community, as we move ahead, he said.There will be major challenges that are out there and it#s about trying to balance out all these things.At present around , pupils, including vulnerable children and those with parents as key workers, are attending  school settings on a daily basis with supervision from , staff.Mr Weir also set out measures to support disadvantaged children during the pandemic.

He acknowledged that existing inequalities within the education system would continue to be a challenge.I think there#s a range of mitigating measures that will want to be put in place to try to ensure that whatever disadvantage is there, that gaps are closed, he said. Is there still likely to be some level of inequality within our society  Yes, that is likely. In and of itself this will not solve it, it will be part of a wider package of measures.In an imperfect situation, all we can try and do is to ensure that we have as much mitigation to give as much opportunity for every child as possible.Mr Weir recognised the strain on mental health for some pupils after the disruption of Covid-. Challenges will be there for mental health across society but particularly for children, that will be a major challenge as we move ahead, he said. I have ensured that [in] the budget as we move ahead, there is some additional money and support for mental health.But it#s got to be tackled on a cross-departmental and cross-sectional regard.

But he has taken a vow of silence. Until now.To be honest, I#m tired of all that, he said. The phone has been ringing non-stop. It#s been unbelievable. But I#ve got my nephew Garbhan McPhillips to do the talking for me.Canon McPhillips said the all-important response from his own parishioners had been positive, with only one negative comment coming from Belfast, not Fermanagh.Just a few months ago Fr McPhillips spoke of how demoralising he was finding it to say Mass in an empty church, but he was looking forward to live-streaming services.And his parishioners said the wise-cracking cleric has been making a habit of introducing little bits of mirth into his Masses, while not taking away from the solemnity of the services.Canon McPhillips said: Playing The Sash last Sunday was just something that I did for the local people and the local craic. But now it#s taken off in a most unexpected way.At first it was reported that the priest from Holy Cross in Lisnaskea had played the recording of the Orange marching tune by mistake at the end of his service, which goes out live on the internet.And he appeared to confirm that it was a faux pas by saying: Sorry I picked the wrong one. Sorry about that. It#s a bit early for thatisn#t it But then observers wonderedthe priest had been swinging the lead and questions were raised about how and why The Sash could possibly have found its way onto the playlist of a Catholic priest.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCanon Jimmy McPhillips FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCanon Jimmy McPhillipsThat led to speculation that it was not an accident.And his nephew Garbhan then admitted that it wasn#t a gaffe, but rather a joke to cheer up the Holy Cross parishioners in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.Canon McPhillips told the Belfasta sense of humour was always important, but particularly in the darkest of times like the coronavirus crisis.That#s what I try to do every Sunday, he added. I tell a few yarns to hopefully build up the morale of the people. Mental health is going to be the biggest issue after this pandemic.In March Canon McPhillips admitted the Covid- pandemic was doing his head in and said he was trying to take one day at a time because to do otherwise would be too traumatic.Speaking to the Fermanagh Herald newspaper, he said: The -hour saturation of news, the Twitter and Facebook, they are all doing my head in, and sleep is going amiss at night as a result, so I am now limiting my news time and only searching Twitter and Facebook for good news stories, the green shoots, the glimmer of hope, and thankfully I am finding so many great examples of this.However, he also talked of the new challenges he was facing in providing spiritual support to his parishioners after coronavirus forced the cancellation of Masses.But he said that he was striving to stay upbeat, adding: We will get through these times, and like the beautul spring flowers popping up all around us, we will have better days ahead. In the more immediate future the priest and his church officials in Lisnaskea are bracing themselves for a surge in people, and not just Catholic parishioners, tuning into the Holy Cross live-stream next Sunday to see what he does next.Sure, where#s the harm in it  We could all be doing with a bit of a lt in these dreadful times we are going through Canon McPhillipsThe priest would not be drawn on whether or not he plans to follow up The Sash with any other tunes, and ones which might come possibly from a dferent cultural background.On Thursday, in a social media message, Canon McPhillips invited people to join him in the live-streaming of a service from Lisnaskea. But he playfully added a note: I promise only SACRED music.One Orangeman, who did not want to be named in case his comments stoked up opposition from within his organisation, said that Canon McPhillips# ruse was hilarious.It#s really great to see him giving everyone a bit of a giggle.Sure, where#s the harm in it  We could all be doing with a bit of a lt in these dreadful times we are going through, he added.Another Orangeman said it was ironic that The Sash, which has caused controversy when it has been played outside Catholic churches on the Twelfth in Belfast, had now been welcomed with a smile inside another church in Fermanagh.It is not, of course, the first time that a piece of music identied with one community here has been played in what might be seen as the wrong place at the wrong time.I told an amused Canon McPhillips how several years ago I witnessed DUP leader the Rev Ian Paisley having to listen to a tune that might not have been music to his ears.The Free Presbyterian Moderator was a guest at a St Patrick#s Day breakfast that I was covering in the La Mon House Hotel at Castlereagh organised by the Ullans Academy, an Ulster-Scots organisation.As part of the cross-community entertainment a Catholic primary school from Belfast was invited to show off its Irish dancing skills to the mixed audience.But when the headmaster pressed the play button on the tape machine, up popped Irish national anthem Amhran na bhFiann - A Soldier#s Song - which was not what the principal or the guests were expecting to hear.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseIan Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappIan PaisleyEvery eye in the room turned immediately towards Paisley, wonderingthere would be a furious reaction, but he dissolved into laughter, much to the relief of an embarrassed educationalist.Fr McPhillips was not surprised.I saw him on a flight from Glasgow once, he said.And he was signing autographs and talking to everyone.It is understood many fans of Celtic were on the plane.Canon McPhillips is from Newtownbutler and he is a keen sports enthusiast.On YouTube there is a short video of him encouraging children in Africa to say Up Fermanagh before his county faced Westmeath in a crucial All-Ireland championship game five years ago.In December  Fr McPhillips was inducted as the parish priest of Aghalurcher in Fermanagh, which includes Lisnaskea and Maguiresbridge.In February last year he was made a canon by Bishop of Clogher Larry Duffy.The canon#s Holy Cross church in Lisnaskea was given a deep-clean on Wednesday to make it totally safe for parishioners to offer private prayers, in line with the easing of coronavirus restrictions by the Stormont Executive.Canon McPhillips said the hope was that church services wouldto normal as soon as possible.

In labs around the globe they are racing against time in a frantic bid to create a Covid- vaccine ­- seen as the key to vanquishing the virus and setting society on the road back to normality.The world is waiting, hoping, expecting, but it is a pressure to deliver that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the scientic world.It is said the best way to tackle an enemy is to understand how that enemy operates, and that is why understanding the nature of Covid- is vital.There is still a lot more to find out .. This is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. The problem is, this is still a very new virus, said Dr Ultan Power, professor in molecular virology at Queen#s University.We have learnt so much about it in such a short space of time, it#s quite remarkable. But there#s still a lot more to find out.We know the virus does not have the ability to mutate in the way influenza changes. It#s not as dramatic as that, but this is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. We still don#t know what it will look like in one or two years# time. That#s an issue to begin with.The simplest way to imagine Covid- is as a tiny tennis ball with #spikes# around the surface, which are formed by proteins.Those spikes interact with another protein on the surface of the human cell called the ACE  Receptor.The spikes help the virus to roll along the cell until it comes across this receptor.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan Power FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan PowerThe ACE  Receptor is the lock, the spike protein is the key. Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach. By David YoungMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTeacher unions have given a cautious welcome to the Education Minister#s timetable for restarting schools. The Ulster Teachers# Unionwelcomed Peter Weir#s collaborative approach in getting schools back to a #new normal#, while the NASUWT union said it must be done in a way that is safe and commands public confidence.UTU president Stephen McCord said parents should be assured that teachers want children back in school - but only when it#s safe for them to be there.Children should be in school and we are in touch daily with the Education Department and the Education Authority towards that end, he said.We can assure parents and pupils that we are doing everything we can to get children back at school where they belong, but safely back at school.Education cannot be at the price of health and lives. We welcome the fact that the Minister and Education Authority are listening to us as they plot the way ahead - for it is, after all, teachers who are at the chalk face and know what will work for their schools - and what won#t.Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT, said the union has previously welcomed the Stormont Executive#s decision not to rush ahead with the reopening of schools.As plans are now starting to be put together in relation to how schools might begin to reopen in the new academic year, it will be critical that the Executive maintains a cautious approach which does not undermine public health or put at risk the health and safety of teachers or children, he said.Once the details emerge of the arrangements, the NASUWT will evaluate them and advise members in the light of the key tests it has established around making schools Covid- secure and minimising risk.The NASUWT#s bottom line remains that no teacher or pupil should be expected toto school until it can be demonstrated that it is safe to do so.NASUWT Northern Ireland representative Justin McCamphill added: While it has been the practice of some schools to reopen for some days at the end of August to prepare for the beginning of the academic year, it would not be acceptable for inidual schools to move their established starting date without agreement with school trade union representatives.Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in Londonderry, told the Belfastthat the minister#s announcement was helpful, in that it brought clarity to the # to school# timetable, and put an end to conjecture about Northern Ireland aligning with other parts of the UK, such as England, where schools are toin June. It#s put that speculation to bed, he said. It gives us time to plan properly.

Concerns have centred around access to the pound, grant, the pound, grant and also the support for those who are self-employed. Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, has called on Economy Minister Diane Dodds to make improvements to the scheme. She said: “One of the biggest challenges we first encountered was that manufacturing and engineering firms, who avail of industrial derating, were excluded from the relief package. “Thankfully, this was addressed by the minister following quite an amount of pressure, but there are still a number of business models that have been excluded. googletag.cmd.push “Businesses who rent their premises were initially unable to apply, having been told to wait for a second phase of help which became available on April th. “The criteria that came with this second phase only caters for sole tenants, meaning that anyone who rents a unit in a premises with multiple businesses, or rents a part of a business space, has been excluded. I cannot see the logic in this, and feel this discriminates against small business owners who never could have foreseen these circumstances. “A business does not see their running costs diminish just because they have a neighbouring business above or below them who happens to rent off the same landlord.” googletag.cmd.push The Mid Ulster MLA, who sits on Stormont’s Audit Committee, said she welcomed a new ‘microbusiness’ package to be introduced next week, but also voiced concerns about dferences from the original scheme. “The minister has announced a microbusiness package which will become available next week, which is certainly much welcomed news,” she said. “However, I am worried that this is unlikely to be worth the same poundk award as the initial scheme, with the provision grants up to poundk outlined in the criteria suggesting that it might depend on uptake. “Given that there was no requirement on any business to prove turnover or ongoing costs to avail of the first grants, which I understand happened for expediency reasons, it is unfair to expect similarly sized businesses, with similar operating costs, to settle for lower grant awards due to a technicality. I have written to Minister Dodds again this week communicating that all renting businesses should be included in the first scheme, andnot, the microbusiness package must guarantee poundk awards for all successful applicants.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes just days after Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that the long-awaited Derry medical school had been agreed by the Executive and said she expects students to enrol in September . Speaking at yesterday’s economy committee meeting, deputy chair and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said: “It would be remiss of me not to thank you in relation to the Executive announcement regarding Magee, and I know there’s still work to be done but there is an imminent deadline and obviously the first intake of students is September  according to the announcement. googletag.cmd.push “We’re delighted about that and the whole city is definitely celebrating that good news story. Hopefully whatever work has to be done in the next few weeks, everything will go through.” In response DUP Minister Diane Dodds highlighted ‘signicant work’ that has to be done and said additional papers will be presented to the Executive. She commented: “The announcement on the Magee Medical School was a good announcement for the Executive to make, a good announcement for the city, but more importantly just a good announcement for the whole of Northern Ireland. “It is quite clear that we need more doctors and we want more of our young people to be able to train and re-train.” googletag.cmd.push However, she added: “I’m not pretending that the path ahead is easy, there is a signicant amount of work to do in relation to the issues around capacity of Ulster University and the financial position of Ulster University. And there is a signicant amount of work to do about that. “But we have set ourselves on a pathway and we are working quite hard on that. There will be further papers to the Executive on that in due course.” In February the Department of Finance confirmed that a poundm loan had been agreed in the form of an ‘addendum to the business case’ for Ulster University’s vastly over-budget Belfast campus. The Department for the Economy will be responsible for overall approval. The relocation of Jordanstown to Belfast city centre was initially expected to cost poundm but swelled to around poundm. FURTHER WORK On Monday, May , Deputy First Minister revealed that the medical school had been given the go-ahead. But, a short time later, the department responsible for its delivery said further work is needed to guarantee student intake next year. An Executive Office spokesperson stated: “The Executive has reaffirmed its commitment to establish a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee, as set out in New Decade, New Approach. “Further work is being undertaken to secure a sustainable outcome for the project within the fastest possible timescales. “Plans are being progressed that would allow an initial student intake of  in September  and the Executive will consider this issue again next month.” To begin with the school will train  doctors within existing buildings on the Magee campus. Supported by City Deal money, a new Medical School facility is expected to be built along the riverfront but that is likely to lie some years ahead. When fully operational with  students in   it will cost poundm to run per year, according to UU. Speaking at Monday’s press conference Michelle O’Neill said plans are being progressed that ‘will allow the first student intake of  in September ’. She added: “This is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. ‘GUARANTEE’ SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has asked for more detail and said a ‘guarantee’ was needed that students will start in . He believes student intake in  is ‘far from certain’ and there are a number of issues to be addressed, including the matter of recurring funding from the Executive. “People don’t have to be put through the hoops that we’ve been put through to get something for Derry but it is largely down to the need for recurring funding. “It’s hopeful, it’s positive, it’s good, but I do think we need to ask questions about how certain this is and I think we’re right to do that given all that we’ve been through.” In terms of long-term goals for expansion, the Foyle MP added: “We need to keep our eye on the big prize and that is , students.” While welcoming the news DUP MLA Gary Middleton said he ‘hoped’ the Magee Medical School would be delivered in . Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Derry University Group , which is campaigning for an independent university in the city, said it is proposing that all future Higher Educationdevelopment in the North West be led and managed under the auspices of an independent university. He added: “UU has neither the finance, capacity nor political will to deliver for Derry. “To that end Derry and Donegal Councils should immediately establish their own HE Development and Scrutiny Committee.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since then ious groups have fought for a meaningful expansion of the Derry campus. Guarantees of expansion to , students have been repeatedly pushed back, the latest target set by the council and Ulster University is , placesby . The Derry News has taken a closer look at the journey since plans for a Medical School were first mooted in the early s.  In March  Ulster Universityofficially announces plans to build a post-graduate Medical School, however, it had been discussed for years already at this stage. googletag.cmd.push Also in , UU agreed to acquire several acres of lands for expansion at Foyle College on the Duncreggan Road. Those plans would not come to fruition for many years. By   plans were raised to build a major poundm Health Sciences facility in Derry as part of Magee expansion, to help increase numbers from around , studentsto ,. This expansion was shelved in tandem with the announcement that UU would be building an entirely new Stormont-backed Belfast campus – initially expected to cost poundm. As part of ’s multi-agency Derry One Plan UU committed itself to having , full-time students at Magee by . googletag.cmd.push In February , the Minister with responsibility for Higher Education, Stephen Farry, postponed any expansion. He said the Stormont Programme for Government ‘did not contain a commitment to deliver expansion as outlined in the One Plan’. In  UU submits plans for the Medical School and applies to the General Medical Councilto train doctors in the North West. May , First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness reaffirm their commitment to Magee expansion in a draft framework for government. January  Stormont collapses after Martin McGuinness resigns in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. March , UU works on a number of recommendations made by the Department of Health- including how the school would be funded - but UU says the school remains on track. Professor Louise Dubras is appointed to oversee the delivery of the Medical School. In May , UU appoints Prof Louise Dubras as Foundation Dean of the School of Medicine. In June , the DoH says UU had yet to meet criteria to ‘demonstrate need and value for money’ for a new medical school. November , Ulster University vice chancellor Prof Paddy Nixon confirms the planned  opening cannot go ahead because there is no devolved government. In January  the lands at Foyle College are eventually purchased after drawn-out negotiations. Ambitions for these lands have not be shared. May , a pound City Deal is announced for Derry and Strabane. It later emerges that UU will receive poundm for the Medical School and other projects. November , plans are once again abandoned to open the Medical School and a new target is set for student intake in September  - the absence of a government is blamed. Throughout  Derry councillors express their anger at ongoing delays, demand expansion and call on the council to attach conditions to City Deal funding granted to UU. January , , devolved government is restored in NI after three years of deadlock. The New Decade, New Approach document which secured that deal vowed to expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School. On January , , a senior official at the Department for the Economy says the business case for overall Magee expansion ‘doesn’t stack up’ and is ‘very out of date’. She explains that the department doesn’t have money for Magee expansion while simultaneously announcing plans to grant UU a poundm bailout for its vastly over-budget Belfast campus. April , , Ulster University confirms that government sign-off is neededthe Medical School is to open as planned in September . At the beginning of May , the DoH states that the business case requires ‘signicant work’ and any decision must have Executive agreement. May , Derry City Deal match funding confirmed bringing the total to poundm. There is renewed optimism that a Medical School will be delivered. On May  The Executive Office assumes responsibility for delivering the Medical School. And on May  Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announces that the Medical School has been approved with a view to opening in September .

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

Their ,km -hour relay exceeded all expectations. The late Brian Calvert wouldve had a glint in his eye. His children jogged along Church Street towards the towns Diamond to a ripple of applause from the socially distant well-wishers. Covid- dictated the magnitude of their welcome. Below the surface, was a community united by a buzz and togetherness that will never be forgotten. It knew no boundaries. Pearses now overseas, also ran, walked and put their hands in their pockets. All in the name of the chosen charity - the NI Chest, Heart and Stroke Association. googletag.cmd.push Last year, a sudden heart attack took Brian from a community he was a cornerstone of. Not only was he Kilreas U football manager, but his -years as an instructor at the local Woodhall Outdoor Pursuits Centre shaped the lives of many. Three-years ago, Brian cycled around Ireland with his friend Randal McAllister in memory of Randals daughter and to raise money for two cancer charities. It was an eight-day adventure, taking in ,km of Irelands testing hills and plains. Last weekends event in Kilrea, wouldve been something Brian wouldve been at the forefront of. Tommy Donaghy would not have been far behind him. googletag.cmd.push Tommy also passed away last year. He was a prominent clubman, a talented footballer in his day and embraced fitness in his later years. He was an avid runner around the town and when the club kitted out their Pearse Park gym, Tommy would train other men there, helping to keep them healthy. An offering of themselves for the good of others and Brian Calvert and Tommy Donaghys memories were honoured on Sunday morning. In a very fitting manner. The seismic response told it all. It all emerged out of senior players Brian Oacuteg McAlary and Karen Kielts running exploits to maintain their fitness. An instinct to raise some money transformed into a relay that just grew and grew. The rest of the community – both at home and abroad – put their shoulder to the wheel and the distance quadrupled by the time the Calverts crossed the finish line. The aim was to raise what later proved to be a modest pound,. With every passing hour, the money was pouring in. At the time of writing, the Justgiving page nudged past pound,, by the time gt aid is accrued. Brian Oacuteg and Karen were backed by the committee. And Kilreas core did the rest. Step by Step. Kilometre by kilometre. Pound by pound. Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Strokes mission statement is about leading the fight against the illnesses highlighted in their name. Kilrea have more than done their bit. They are this weeks GAA story of selflessness, but they are not on their own. The previous week, Coleraine pooled together for a ,km relay to raise money for the Samaritans and Christina Passmores contribution deserves a special mention.  Christina Passmore does her bit in Eoghan Rua fundraiser The -year-old mother of the clubs All-Ireland winning camogie manager Joe and granny of Derry goalkeeper Leo, took part. A staunch Tyrone woman, Christina loves her sport, Joe told me. The GAA giving theme continued. It was impossible not to be touched by the Kildare man Dan McCabes rendition of Mary Blacks A Song for Ireland. It will be the best four and a half minutes you will spend this week. His voice is staggering, but it accompanied photos from every corner of Irelanddepicting GAA clubs support during the current pandemic. Make sure you watch it. We can all relate to it. Dungiven united to setup a community group within days of lockown. The same thing happened in Ballinascreen, with the local GAA club also donating their lotto proceeds. “It was a chance for the club to contribute to the community during these dficult times, because over the years the community has played a massive role in the running of Ballinascreen GAC,” Mickey Boyle pointed out in an interview last month.

Their ,km -hour relay exceeded all expectations. The late Brian Calvert wouldve had a glint in his eye. His children jogged along Church Street towards the towns Diamond to a ripple of applause from the socially distant well-wishers. Covid- dictated the magnitude of their welcome. Below the surface, was a community united by a buzz and togetherness that will never be forgotten. It knew no boundaries. Pearses now overseas, also ran, walked and put their hands in their pockets. All in the name of the chosen charity - the NI Chest, Heart and Stroke Association. googletag.cmd.push Last year, a sudden heart attack took Brian from a community he was a cornerstone of. Not only was he Kilreas U football manager, but his -years as an instructor at the local Woodhall Outdoor Pursuits Centre shaped the lives of many. Three-years ago, Brian cycled around Ireland with his friend Randal McAllister in memory of Randals daughter and to raise money for two cancer charities. It was an eight-day adventure, taking in ,km of Irelands testing hills and plains. Last weekends event in Kilrea, wouldve been something Brian wouldve been at the forefront of. Tommy Donaghy would not have been far behind him. googletag.cmd.push Tommy also passed away last year. He was a prominent clubman, a talented footballer in his day and embraced fitness in his later years. He was an avid runner around the town and when the club kitted out their Pearse Park gym, Tommy would train other men there, helping to keep them healthy. An offering of themselves for the good of others and Brian Calvert and Tommy Donaghys memories were honoured on Sunday morning. In a very fitting manner. The seismic response told it all. It all emerged out of senior players Brian Oacuteg McAlary and Karen Kielts running exploits to maintain their fitness. An instinct to raise some money transformed into a relay that just grew and grew. The rest of the community – both at home and abroad – put their shoulder to the wheel and the distance quadrupled by the time the Calverts crossed the finish line. The aim was to raise what later proved to be a modest pound,. With every passing hour, the money was pouring in. At the time of writing, the Justgiving page nudged past pound,, by the time gt aid is accrued. Brian Oacuteg and Karen were backed by the committee. And Kilreas core did the rest. Step by Step. Kilometre by kilometre. Pound by pound. Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Strokes mission statement is about leading the fight against the illnesses highlighted in their name. Kilrea have more than done their bit. They are this weeks GAA story of selflessness, but they are not on their own. The previous week, Coleraine pooled together for a ,km relay to raise money for the Samaritans and Christina Passmores contribution deserves a special mention.  Christina Passmore does her bit in Eoghan Rua fundraiser The -year-old mother of the clubs All-Ireland winning camogie manager Joe and granny of Derry goalkeeper Leo, took part. A staunch Tyrone woman, Christina loves her sport, Joe told me. The GAA giving theme continued. It was impossible not to be touched by the Kildare man Dan McCabes rendition of Mary Blacks A Song for Ireland. It will be the best four and a half minutes you will spend this week. His voice is staggering, but it accompanied photos from every corner of Irelanddepicting GAA clubs support during the current pandemic. Make sure you watch it. We can all relate to it. Dungiven united to setup a community group within days of lockown. The same thing happened in Ballinascreen, with the local GAA club also donating their lotto proceeds. “It was a chance for the club to contribute to the community during these dficult times, because over the years the community has played a massive role in the running of Ballinascreen GAC,” Mickey Boyle pointed out in an interview last month.

Brian Mullins was at the helm when the Anglo Celt Cup last ed to the Oakleaf County in  and Michael McMullan spoke to him about his three years in charge. Reigning champions Dublin led the  All-Ireland semi-final by four points when a loose ball plodded around the middle of Croke Park. Brian Mullins ghosted from behind a ruck. He pulled on the ball with a measured conviction. The Dublin midfielders dink hovered towards Pat Gogarty, under the shadow of the Hogan Stand. His diagonal pass found the unmarked Tony Hanahoe with the Canal End goal in his sights. After dodging two token Derry tackles, Hanahoe roofed the ball unceremoniously to the top corner. John Sommers didnt have a prayer. googletag.cmd.push It was Mullins first taste of Derry. Anthony McGurk was in the opposing corner, on a team managed by the late Frankie Kearney. The three men would unite  years later to take charge of a turbulent Oakleaf ship, following the sacking of Eamonn Coleman and the player strikes that followed Mickey Morans appointment in . Brian tiptoed onto the management circuit, like he did into Dublins team of the seventies. As an -year-old, a son of Kerry and Clare parents, he was selling programmes at the  All-Ireland final, before being called in by supremo Kevin Heffernan the following season, by chance almost. googletag.cmd.push In a bid to bolster his midfield options, Heffo got tipped off about an upcoming Fran Ryder and headed to Belfast for a Thomond Colleges Sigerson Cup clash against the Ranch. It was, however, Ryders colleague and the managers clubmate Mullins who caught the eye. He brought his selectors to watch Brian in action for St Vincents in an U championship clash, where he battered through the opposition defence before scoring a last gasp winning goal. That was it, Mullins was in. There was still a hiccup and he almost missed the All-Ireland final win over Galway. A chipped bone in his foot, sustained in Dublin U action, had Mullins laid up in the Mater hospital, with less than a month to the September showpiece. Heffernan and the chief surgeon had a dference of opinion on Mullins fitness, before the Dubs boss got his way. “A decade in medical school didnt please Kevin,” commented Dublin player Dr Pat ONeill, who was also working in the Mater at the time, in Tom Humphries Dublin v Kerry book. Mullins secured the first of four Celtic Crosses, matching his uncle Bill Casey of Kerry. His career also saw him lose five further finals – all to the Kingdom – and coast to club All-Ireland glory. Heffo, according to Mullins, was a big influence on their squad during that era. “I would have learned a lot from him and hopefully carried those lessons into my own operation,” he offers. “I have been lucky during my late teens and early s...I picked up a lot of what he was about.” In the summer of , Mullins career and le flashed before him in a car crash, on his way from a holiday in Wexford to training in Dublin. He broke his leg and suffered severe head injuries. A testament to his toughness was shaking off a career-threatening injury, thanks to help from Irish Olympian Eamon Coghlan. Mullins restored the muscle in his legs and played in a further three All-Ireland finals, winning one in , a game where he was one of three Dublin players dismissed. Brian was made captain for the  season, but could only look on as Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute delivered a rousing acceptance speech as Gaeilgeafter lting the Sam. It was his last time in the Dublin jersey and when Kevin Heffernan stepped away, he joined Sean Doherty and Robbie Kelleher as a three-man management team to succeed him. Mullins, currently the Director of Sport at UCD, was a qualied PE Teacher from University of Limerick, but never felt management would be something he would have tried his hand at. The trio left the post after a defeat by an emerging Meath team. “There were many other things going on in my le, between owning a business and teaching. Then I moved to Donegal in ,” Mullins points out. He had been running a fitness centre business with another Vins man, Mickey Whelan, he was playing with the club and teaching in Dublin. Mullins was appointed as Principal of Carndonagh Community School, where he lived for nine years and played a bit of club football for the local club. “It was the biggest school in Ireland,” he says. “The school used to compete in all levels at Ulster Schools competitions. There were clubs in all the town on the peninsula, there was a big catchment area.” His next county involvement would come from an unlikely corner. *** He cant put it down to an exact moment, when Derry came calling. Mullins was now rooted in Donegal and managing all aspects of school le was all-consuming. “When the Derry opportunity came up in , it wasnt something I was necessarily thinking of doing,” he recalls. “Managing a county team is something I wasnt preoccupied with,” he added, before giving it some consideration. “I ended up doing the job for three years,” Mullins added. “The squad was already in place, which included most,not all of the All-Ireland squad of .” Brian McGilligan and Tony Scullion would step away during his tenure, with Danny Quinn later taking on a coaching role after helping Harry Gribbinwith the U team. Enda Gormley did begin the   as a trainer. He felt a lethargy, which later transpired to be a blood problem. Once it cleared, Mullins coaxed Enda back to the playing . In the early days, Eugene Young trained the team, with Frankie Kearney and Anthony McGurk as selectors. “Anthony lived in Derry City, so I got in touch with him,” Mullins points out. “We were about the same age. I knew he had been heavily involved with Lavey and thatJohnny was playing. “I wouldnt have spoken to Anthony for  years before I got in contact. I wouldnt necessarily have kept in contact with players I had played against.” With his appointment two or three weeks before the start of the league, Mullins hadnt attended the club championship, having still been playing in Donegal with Carndonagh that summer. “Training went well all through the league. The players enjoyed the games and particularly the win over Donegal in the final,” came his early memories of his first season. Did he feel retaining the league title was a priority  “They had ambition,” he said of the squad. “They wanted to do well and they wanted to win the league in . It was indicative of their ability and their motivation to try and follow on from . “Some of them felt they took their eye off the ball in  and  and they wanted to pick up again.” During our phone conversation, Mullins comes across as a thinker. Every sentence is calm, to the point and absent of background noise. “Fergal McCusker, Anthony Tohill, Henryand Kieran McKeever were there and any amount of them were in their mid-s and felt they had a lot of football in them,” he adds. Reflecting on the litany of names, and with hindsight, winning the league was no surprise. The championship was a dferent kettle of fish he states. After a facile win over Armagh at home, they bowed out to Tyrone in Clones. “The wheels came off...from the high of winning the league final, to two months later being out of the championship and your effort to win an All-Ireland - which is what most teams set out for - was derailed.” Only the front door was in vogue back then, it was another year away from Sam and Derry were no closer. Mullins felt there were no mental scars from a second defeat to their rivals in as many years. “There is no dficulty when you are at that level,” Mullins points out, with a firm tone of voice. “You dont dwell on defeats...apart from aspects you can learn from. It is another effort and another year of doing better than the previous year.” After the  championship defeat, to Tyrones  men, Mullins went at the league in his first season with conviction. Restoring the winning habit was important. “There was some thinking that we peaked too early. In , we tried to put more into the championship.” They didnt qualy for the latter stages of the league and it took a comfortable replay win to see off Monaghan in the first round, to set up Derry versus Tyrone – for the third year in a row. Noel Donnelly thumped home an early goal but it was a  dawn. Joe Cassidy and Joe Brolly notched - between them, with the latter blowing kisses after he slid home his goal and Seamus Downey grabbed a second goal in a hammering of sorts. “We fell foul of Cavan in the final,” Mullins remembers. “In some ways, we thought we got some things right but, on the day, Cavan...they were that little bit ahead of us in terms of delivering on the pitch. We didnt do it.” Jason Reilly did a Ravenelli by pulling his jersey over his head in celebration to mark his th minute goal. Cavan were now ahead. Seconds later Gary McGill had the goal chance, but his shot went straight at goalkeeper Paul ODowd. In the end, Cavan prevailed by the narrowest of margins. Controversy surrounded the victory. They were given a point in the first half that should never have stood. Raymond Cunninghams shot went a foot to the right of the posts. It was something Mullins, surprisingly, didnt and doesnt buy into. “When you are on the sideline and you are involved in a match -the umpire puts up his flag and the referee tots it as a score, thats it, it is a point. “I dont dwell on it. You dwell on the fact you were beaten by a point and wonder where you might have missed scores yourself. “There was a point on the scoreboard, the record shows that and that wouldve been our view coming out of it. On any given day, anything can happen with the opposition that puts them that little bit ahead. It is only learning what you didnt do or what you didnt do enough of, to make sure you made up for it in some way.” *** If Brian Mullins first season was a rushed start, going into  offered more time to scour the county for new players. Clubs were sounded out and recommendations were gathered of the young and emerging talent. “You went with the management team to matches,” he points out. “You looked to see who you could take into the . I am thinking of the likes of Enda Muldoon.” The Ballinderry man was one of six players from the U All-Ireland winning squad to come into the senior scene under the Dublin man. He had handed Sean Marty Lockhart his debut against Kerry at Ballinascreen in the Dublin mans first season. David ONeill and Paul McFlynn came into the defence for , with Joe Cassidy up front and Johnny McBride playing in a number of roles across the middle third. “We would go into each year believing thatwe did all we could and put our best foot forward, the Derry squad would believe they were equal to or better than most in Ulster and , was no dferent” Mullins outlined of this third season. “We were beat by Tyrone in  and by Cavan in , by a very close score, so going into  – why wouldnt you believe. We were happy enough where we were.” Derry lost the league final to Offaly, before hitting three goals in a double scores win over Monaghan in the championship. A semi-final win over Armagh took Derry through to another final, this time a low-scoring scrap with Donegal. “It was fine margins and we were close to losing again in  but we managed to get over the line,” came Mullins initial thoughts of the game. Captain Kieran McKeever didnt give Manus Boyle a snf and Lockharts masterclass on Tony Boyle put him on his way to an all-star later in the year. Even with a man of the match performance from wing-back Paul McFlynn, it looked like a game that was going to squirm away from Derry once again. With  seconds of stoppage time gone and the sides level, McFlynn pounced on a shanked Eoin McCloskey kick-out. As the Loup man scrambled on the ground, Anthony Tohill came in support, before drilling a thunderous delivery over midfield. Substitute Geoffrey McGonigle gained possession. With two Donegal defenders converging, Geoff flicked the ball across to Joe Brolly, who sidestepped Tony Blake before finishing the winning goal. “The fact that Geoffrey was involved in the goal makes it look like a good a decision,” Mullins ponders. “But these things can be seen as going horribly wrong and they can go right.” He was only on the pitch five minutes, but it wasnt a premeditated substitution. “In any circumstances, when you pick your starting , a lot of the time you have subs and decisions to have them as subs or in the starting  is a narrow decision. “We knew Geoffrey had the ability and he wouldve been very close to starting the game and putting him in, we were hopeful and knew he was capable of making a contribution – its as simple as that.” In the semi-final, Derry were convincingly beaten by a Galway team who would again beat them at the penultimate stage in . “That was the end of my three years,” Mullins conceded, while heaping praise on the players, the board and the GAA families during his three seasons. “It was about motivating the players, which wasnt a really dficult thing. They were a great bunch of lads and I would have nothing but praise for them. “That is the thing about sport, there is no guarantee that just because you put in a big effort you are going to end up winning. It is swings and roundabouts, you take the defeats on the chin and you head on into the rest of your le. “I just felt it was time for a change of voice and a change of energy and a change of direction,” he states of his decision to step down. “I had other things, in terms of my work and family, that I needed to put a priority on, and I felt the Derry job needed somebody dferent,” he concluded. Mullins still has family in north Donegal and would sometimes catch up with some of the Derry players of that era. He was in Moyola for Derrys golf day in , to mark  years since winning Sam. And  years on, Mullins remains the last manager to deliver championship silver. The wait continues. RELATED - Mullins surprised at Derrys -year gap without an Ulster title. More...

Brian Mullins was at the helm when the Anglo Celt Cup last ed to the Oakleaf County in  and Michael McMullan spoke to him about his three years in charge. Reigning champions Dublin led the  All-Ireland semi-final by four points when a loose ball plodded around the middle of Croke Park. Brian Mullins ghosted from behind a ruck. He pulled on the ball with a measured conviction. The Dublin midfielders dink hovered towards Pat Gogarty, under the shadow of the Hogan Stand. His diagonal pass found the unmarked Tony Hanahoe with the Canal End goal in his sights. After dodging two token Derry tackles, Hanahoe roofed the ball unceremoniously to the top corner. John Sommers didnt have a prayer. googletag.cmd.push It was Mullins first taste of Derry. Anthony McGurk was in the opposing corner, on a team managed by the late Frankie Kearney. The three men would unite  years later to take charge of a turbulent Oakleaf ship, following the sacking of Eamonn Coleman and the player strikes that followed Mickey Morans appointment in . Brian tiptoed onto the management circuit, like he did into Dublins team of the seventies. As an -year-old, a son of Kerry and Clare parents, he was selling programmes at the  All-Ireland final, before being called in by supremo Kevin Heffernan the following season, by chance almost. googletag.cmd.push In a bid to bolster his midfield options, Heffo got tipped off about an upcoming Fran Ryder and headed to Belfast for a Thomond Colleges Sigerson Cup clash against the Ranch. It was, however, Ryders colleague and the managers clubmate Mullins who caught the eye. He brought his selectors to watch Brian in action for St Vincents in an U championship clash, where he battered through the opposition defence before scoring a last gasp winning goal. That was it, Mullins was in. There was still a hiccup and he almost missed the All-Ireland final win over Galway. A chipped bone in his foot, sustained in Dublin U action, had Mullins laid up in the Mater hospital, with less than a month to the September showpiece. Heffernan and the chief surgeon had a dference of opinion on Mullins fitness, before the Dubs boss got his way. “A decade in medical school didnt please Kevin,” commented Dublin player Dr Pat ONeill, who was also working in the Mater at the time, in Tom Humphries Dublin v Kerry book. Mullins secured the first of four Celtic Crosses, matching his uncle Bill Casey of Kerry. His career also saw him lose five further finals – all to the Kingdom – and coast to club All-Ireland glory. Heffo, according to Mullins, was a big influence on their squad during that era. “I would have learned a lot from him and hopefully carried those lessons into my own operation,” he offers. “I have been lucky during my late teens and early s...I picked up a lot of what he was about.” In the summer of , Mullins career and le flashed before him in a car crash, on his way from a holiday in Wexford to training in Dublin. He broke his leg and suffered severe head injuries. A testament to his toughness was shaking off a career-threatening injury, thanks to help from Irish Olympian Eamon Coghlan. Mullins restored the muscle in his legs and played in a further three All-Ireland finals, winning one in , a game where he was one of three Dublin players dismissed. Brian was made captain for the  season, but could only look on as Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute delivered a rousing acceptance speech as Gaeilgeafter lting the Sam. It was his last time in the Dublin jersey and when Kevin Heffernan stepped away, he joined Sean Doherty and Robbie Kelleher as a three-man management team to succeed him. Mullins, currently the Director of Sport at UCD, was a qualied PE Teacher from University of Limerick, but never felt management would be something he would have tried his hand at. The trio left the post after a defeat by an emerging Meath team. “There were many other things going on in my le, between owning a business and teaching. Then I moved to Donegal in ,” Mullins points out. He had been running a fitness centre business with another Vins man, Mickey Whelan, he was playing with the club and teaching in Dublin. Mullins was appointed as Principal of Carndonagh Community School, where he lived for nine years and played a bit of club football for the local club. “It was the biggest school in Ireland,” he says. “The school used to compete in all levels at Ulster Schools competitions. There were clubs in all the town on the peninsula, there was a big catchment area.” His next county involvement would come from an unlikely corner. *** He cant put it down to an exact moment, when Derry came calling. Mullins was now rooted in Donegal and managing all aspects of school le was all-consuming. “When the Derry opportunity came up in , it wasnt something I was necessarily thinking of doing,” he recalls. “Managing a county team is something I wasnt preoccupied with,” he added, before giving it some consideration. “I ended up doing the job for three years,” Mullins added. “The squad was already in place, which included most,not all of the All-Ireland squad of .” Brian McGilligan and Tony Scullion would step away during his tenure, with Danny Quinn later taking on a coaching role after helping Harry Gribbinwith the U team. Enda Gormley did begin the   as a trainer. He felt a lethargy, which later transpired to be a blood problem. Once it cleared, Mullins coaxed Enda back to the playing . In the early days, Eugene Young trained the team, with Frankie Kearney and Anthony McGurk as selectors. “Anthony lived in Derry City, so I got in touch with him,” Mullins points out. “We were about the same age. I knew he had been heavily involved with Lavey and thatJohnny was playing. “I wouldnt have spoken to Anthony for  years before I got in contact. I wouldnt necessarily have kept in contact with players I had played against.” With his appointment two or three weeks before the start of the league, Mullins hadnt attended the club championship, having still been playing in Donegal with Carndonagh that summer. “Training went well all through the league. The players enjoyed the games and particularly the win over Donegal in the final,” came his early memories of his first season. Did he feel retaining the league title was a priority  “They had ambition,” he said of the squad. “They wanted to do well and they wanted to win the league in . It was indicative of their ability and their motivation to try and follow on from . “Some of them felt they took their eye off the ball in  and  and they wanted to pick up again.” During our phone conversation, Mullins comes across as a thinker. Every sentence is calm, to the point and absent of background noise. “Fergal McCusker, Anthony Tohill, Henryand Kieran McKeever were there and any amount of them were in their mid-s and felt they had a lot of football in them,” he adds. Reflecting on the litany of names, and with hindsight, winning the league was no surprise. The championship was a dferent kettle of fish he states. After a facile win over Armagh at home, they bowed out to Tyrone in Clones. “The wheels came off...from the high of winning the league final, to two months later being out of the championship and your effort to win an All-Ireland - which is what most teams set out for - was derailed.” Only the front door was in vogue back then, it was another year away from Sam and Derry were no closer. Mullins felt there were no mental scars from a second defeat to their rivals in as many years. “There is no dficulty when you are at that level,” Mullins points out, with a firm tone of voice. “You dont dwell on defeats...apart from aspects you can learn from. It is another effort and another year of doing better than the previous year.” After the  championship defeat, to Tyrones  men, Mullins went at the league in his first season with conviction. Restoring the winning habit was important. “There was some thinking that we peaked too early. In , we tried to put more into the championship.” They didnt qualy for the latter stages of the league and it took a comfortable replay win to see off Monaghan in the first round, to set up Derry versus Tyrone – for the third year in a row.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

He said: “It has made it possible for me to keep in contact with family and indeed friends over the mountain and further afield, because I cant travel from Derry to visit themat the moment. “The banter, the craic and the obvious support from all the members has added a new dimension of caring and supportive care to the group.” Fellow user Brenda Murray added: “This page has created a great and informative history on past and present events, community, and iniduals. “It shows so many dferent aspects of the beautul area we live in. It has reached out to so many in this dficult time from people living in the area to people with ancestral connections. “It has helped me and many others through lockdown just by reading the updates and seeing the beautul pictures.” The appetite for local history and news has been further strengthened as the Covid- restrictions have given people more time to learn about their surroundings. Roisin Cuskeran, admin of the Slieve Gallion page, says the communication it provides at this time is ‘vital’. “I think the page brings people together, gives them a forum for communication that’s vital especially in the current situation,” she said. “It gives them that sense of community and the security in knowing they are not going through this alone. “It’s helping to distract people from the topic of Covid also therefore helping their mental health and bringing together people from all over the world. “They all have a common connection- links to the Slieve Gallion Area - and because of this the members are helping each other cope with the reality of what is going on around us.” Jonathan Hudson, admin of the Magherafelt Facebook group, says he is amazed at the interest in local history. Im always amazed at peoples reactions to local history, just shows how little we were told in school, he said. Since lockdown, the numbers shot up over another  which was to be expected I suppose. However, people really embraced anything we did. I decided to do a musical tribute to the NHS, key workers and carers. It went brilliantly, dozens of local musicians and singers all sent in phone footage of two songs, including both local semi-finalists in this years The Voice, Brooke Scullion and Jonny Brooks. The video has just hit , views across social media so that tells its own story about how popular the page is. People are genuinely interested in how the town became what it is today. I tend to post the good and the bad, its all history and the one thing we can all learn from is our history.

In this weeks interview with the County Derry Post, the former Derry manager looks back on a tenure that saw him win a league and an Ulster title. He also played down the controversy surrounding Raymond Cunninghams point in the first-half of the  final, a game Cavan won by a point. Mullins has not had any involvement with Dublin since , when the three-man senior management team he was involved withstepped down and is the Director of Sport at UCD. googletag.cmd.push Since Mullins departure from Derry, the county have won two NFLtitles and were on the the cusp of the  All-Ireland final, until Matthew Clancys game-changing goal. Derry went toe to toe with the Dubs in , reached an Ulster final in  with brothers Eoin and Paddy Bradley on the injured list. “I am a bit surprised, given the tradition in the county and the capacity,” answered Mullins of his thoughts on the -year gap. “I know enough about Derry football over the years and it is quite competitive. You have the likes of St Pats Maghera at school and at club level, you have Slaughtneil doing so well. They are all yardsticks of how strong or otherwise the sport is.” googletag.cmd.push “I would have expected that Derry would have popped in there with a team worthy of winning a few of them at one time or a few years of once-off successes.” When asked of the Dublin success, Mullins doesnt claim any credit or kudos for the transformation. Occasionally, Dublin will book their development squad into the facilities at UCD, where is the Director of Sport, but they all have their own management teams. “I have not had any involvement with any Dublin senior, minor of U team since ,” Mullins outlines. “Jack McCaffery, Paul Mannion and others who attended UCD have been on the team but thats as far as it goes.” On the topic of Dublins five in a row, Mullins refers to the high standards that any All-Ireland team brings. He lists Kerry, Mayo and Tyrone as being on the champions coattails, with Dublins consistency and resilience being big factors in the five-in-a-row. “I still think there have been a number of All-Ireland finals in the past while that Dublin were within a hairs breath from losing, it is just that they found the resilience at vital moments that the opposition didnt have.” Donegal were the last Ulster team to win Sam and were close in . Down lost a final to Cork by a point  and Tyrone, with Mickey Hartes men also beaten by Dublin convincingly in . Mullins doesnt feel there is a lot of catching up needed, but Ulster teams need to reassess. “The inidual counties are well-capable of managing and maintaining an effort. In the s, there was Derry, Down and Donegal and eventually Armagh and Tyrone all succeeded to getting to the standard of what was required. “If they could do it in the s and early s, they might have to go back, as you might say, to a drawing board...but it shows they are well capable of doing it.” RELATED - Rory Gallagher feels Derry can take advantage of lockdown.

It was a tough week for the stars, who lost the league cup final to Draperstown Celtic the previous Friday. Oxford dominated play for signicant periods of the game, they failed to capitalise on any chances which came their way and the Sky Blues were worthy winners, retaining the cup in the process. Magherafelt were appearing in the final for the fourth year in a row and made the better start. googletag.cmd.push Oxford had the best of the opening  minutes with Logue pulling most of the strings in the centre of midfield. However, despite the impressive approach play from the city side, the end product was lacking in quality. Magherafelt had a bit more success in the final third, with Walker having to react quickly to smother the ball at the feet of Dermot Larkin as the centre forward lined up a shot on the on the six yard line. Things were looking ominous for Stars as Magherafelt gradually took control of the game. Sky Blues deservedly took the lead in the  minute when Chris Brady sent an excellent low curling cross in from the left wing. Keeper Walker managed to get a hand to the ball but this played it into the path of an incoming Michael Collins who was able to stab the ball into the net. googletag.cmd.push With only seconds to half-time, James Bateson doubled their lead. In the th minute, Oxford centre forward Paul Doran had the chance to bring his side back into the game when the ball landed perfectly at his feet following a flicked-on head from a throw-in. However, his shot went high and wide. Frustration seemed to be getting the better of some Oxford players and midfielder Brian Rainey was sent off in the th minute for dissent. Magherafelt put the final nail in the coffin with two minutes to go when Dermot Larkin curled a superb shot from the edge of the box into the right hand corner of the Oxford goal. In the dying seconds Oxford managed to get a consolation goal when a free-kick but it was only a temporary blip for Magherafelt who made their way home over the Glenshane Pass with the cup. MAGHERAFELT: Michael O’Neill, Gregory Stewart, Darren Walls, Ryan Campbell, Gareth Cassidy, Connor Monaghan, Chris Brady, Michael Collins, Dermot Larkin, James Bateson, Ciaran Mallon. SUBS: Ciaran Monaghan for G Stewart , Aaron Hawe for J Bateson , Stephen O’Neill for C Brady .

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry.

It was Smythrsquos fourth career success, his first having been at Comber.Eleven took part in the Bewleyrsquos Open Race for lady riders with victory going to Comber owner Elizabeth OrsquoPreyrsquos Wherersquos Sam, ridden by Caroline Barker.Jackie Kidd was second on her neighbour Norman McKnightrsquos Lady Zaffaran, with the veteran Voloi third.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

It is God-given common sense.Regrettable indeedRev Kirkland feels that such a measure was somehow ungodly. In my view it represents a wholly necessary and essential pastoral approach.Comparing us with the US is not overly helpful, given the immensity of their own situation. Rev Kirkland’s closing gambit is conjecture of the finest quality . I dare say God has plenty to say on the whole matter, but I would safely contend that promoting foolhardiness is not amongst it.Many churches, my own included, have resorted to online gospel witness during lockdown, with, it would seem, an engagement above and beyond that of any conventional attendance at church services. Granted, coming together again in our sacred spaces will be a great and wonderful blessing, butthis period has taught us anything it is that the Lord Christ has and will continue to use trials and testing for His glory. Not wholly spiritual, but nonetheless true ...you don’t realise what you take for granted until it’s not there.I have learned much under God about new ways of compassion and practical care of the flock in these dferent times ... ways that speak of Jesus without resort to mere bellowing for  minutes from a pulpit. Mind you a full gospel sermon is always non-negotiable!As to the work of solitary prayer not being an evangelical practice.

this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd

disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon

required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and
