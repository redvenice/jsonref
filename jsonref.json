When we got home all the parents were there to meet us with mounds of fish and chips and dozens of bottles of champagne.’Both Denise and Kevin are quick to point out that while Carole was an involved parent, she was far from pushy. ‘There were some parents whose voices you dreaded hearing on the phone,’ says Kevin. ‘And Carole was definitely not one of them. When she rang — which she rarely did — she would have a point.‘For example, Catherine had obviously told her she thought it was unfair the boys had a big common room with a pool table and the girls didn’t.‘Carole rang and asked why. We agreed it was unfair and, entirely as a result of her intervention, rules were changed. From then on it was a joint common room.’But while it was Carole who made the tricky phone calls, it was left to her husband Mike to be the school entertainer.‘Like in most marriages, the woman is in charge,’ says Denise. ‘Mike had the most gorgeous sense of humour. You could have a joke with him.‘At the end of every term, we always had a parents’ match — the girls’ netball team would play the parents and Mike would turn up and be the joker.

The farthest point of the ellipse is called the apogee. When a full moon appears at perigee, the moon looks brighter and larger than a regular moon, hence the nickname supermoon.   February 19 will see the second lunar spectacle in a supermoon trilogy. The first supermoon was the \u0027Blood Wolf Super Moon\u0027 on January 21 and the third will take place on March 21.On February 19, the moon will be 221,734 miles from Earth.For New Yorkers, the moon will rise at 5.46pm and will set at 7.35am on February 20, as per the U.S. Naval Observatory. And it\u0027ll be officially full at 10.53am EST according to NASA\u0027s Skycal. However, others claims that a supermoon only occurs when the centre of the moon is less than 223,694 miles (360,000 kilometres) from the centre of Earth.By this definition, only the full moons of March and April count as full supermoons in 2020.Regardless, it should make a spectacular site for those lucky enough to catch a glimpse through the clouds.If possible, one of the best times to view the moon is when it is close to the horizon, due to an optical illusion that makes it appear even bigger due to its relative size compared to buildings, trees and statues in the distance.Astronomers advise photographers and sky gazers to download apps and maps to track the progress of the moon across the sky in order to make sightings easier.

The rise is predicted to give the Treasury an annual £200 million windfall.The controversy is linked to a new system for testing the emissions and fuel economy of cars that is meant to be more representative of \u0027real-world\u0027 driving conditions.Since September 1, 2018, all new cars have had to conform to the so-called Worldwide harmonised Light vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).This replaced a discredited test that had been used since the 1980s called the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Experts say NEDC produced CO2 results that were 40 per cent lower than the actual greenhouse gases being emitted.         The controversy is linked to a new system for testing the emissions and fuel economy of cars that is meant to be more representative of \u0027real-world\u0027 driving conditionsCar manufacturers and dealers were told to publish the fuel economy figures – measured in miles-per-gallon – from the new tests in their sales brochures, websites and showrooms from January 2019.But they were banned from publishing the new, higher CO2 figures. Instead, they were ordered to continue using the grossly inaccurate NEDC figures. Guidance seen by the MoS from the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA), an agency of the Department for Transport (DfT), from November 2018 said that \u0027only NEDC CO2 figures will be used on labels and within advertising prior to April 6, 2020\u0027.Retailers were advised to include a disclaimer that the CO2 figures were derived from the \u0027outgoing test cycle\u0027 and that there is a \u0027new test\u0027. It, however, failed to make clear that the results would be significantly different. It means that someone wanting to buy a 1.8 litre Toyota Prius hybrid would currently be told that the vehicle\u0027s CO2 emission is 75gkm. In fact, the updated figure, which will be made public after April 6, is 25 per cent higher at 94gkm.The Government has attempted to justify the cover-up by claiming that publishing the true figures would have been confusing for motorists. This is because until April, car taxes – which are linked to CO2 emissions – will be based on the false emission figures.But last night the car industry described the policy as \u0027bizarre\u0027 and said they had wanted to be more open with the public.         Last night, Andy McDonald, Labour\u0027s Shadow Transport Secretary, accused the Government of \u0027intentionally misleading the public over vehicle emissions\u0027Jenny Bates, of Friends Of The Earth, said the cover-up was a \u0027betrayal of those trying to take emissions into account when choosing a car\u0027. Edmund King, of the AA, said: \u0027Car showrooms are following complex Government guidelines on what to display. Drivers care about the environment and many may be in for a big shock – having bought a car displaying the old figures only to find the CO2 output is 25 per cent higher than stated.\u0027The Mail on Sunday last week visited seven car showrooms and in each one was quoted the lower NEDC emission figures.Mike Hawes, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers And Traders, said: \u0027Manufacturers are not, bizarrely, allowed by law to display WLTP-derived figures in UK showrooms or advertising until April – this is not what the industry wanted.\u0027Toyota said that while Government regulations prevent it from using WLTP figures in its brochures, staff have been told the figures so they can \u0027inform customers\u0027. Its website says that CO2 figures are \u0027subject to change for new vehicles registered after April 1\u0027.The DfT said: \u0027The new emissions testing regime from April 2020 provides a closer representation of \u0027real-world\u0027 fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, allowing consumers to make more informed decisions.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"REXit European entries Crufts drop 12 Britain leaves EU","story":"Share this article Kathleen Roosens, from Belgium, whose papillon called Dylan won Best in Show last year, said: ‘I think fewer Europeans entered Crufts this year entirely because of Brexit – nothing else.‘Some people I spoke to feared their dogs needed rabies tests.’         The Government only clarified on January 27 – a week after the deadline – that pet travel rules would remain unchanged until the end of this yearAlmost 20,000 dogs will compete at this year’s event, which begins on March 5 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, but just 3,171 of them will be from Europe – down from 3,611 last year.It is the first significant fall for a decade and comes after steady growth since 2000 when pet passports were introduced, allowing dogs to enter the UK without six months spent in quarantine.Italy is the European country with the highest number of entries this year with 366 dogs, although that figure is down 11 per cent on last year.

The champion was 24 and preparing to fight Henry Cooper in London, but he had recently alienated many fans in the States by joining up with the Nation of Islam, speaking in favour of racial segregation and declaring that he would not fight for his country in Vietnam. “I don’t have no quarrel with those Viet Congs!”Parks was a significant figure in black American culture – he was not only a photographer but also a novelist, musician and film director (he went on to make the 1971 movie Shaft). He went to see Ali on something of a mission. He wanted to reclaim the fighter as a true American hero, show Ali’s humanity at a time when the press was calling him a brash and “shameless traitor”. Parks was encouraged as soon as he walked into Ali’s hotel room. “Sit down,” Ali said. “They tell me you’re the greatest.”In the weeks that the pair spent together, Parks gained the full trust of the boxer, watching him training, but also relaxing with his family and friends and in private moments of prayer and meditation. In return, in an extraordinary series of pictures and a long essay, Parks began to shape a new understanding of Ali, calling his story “The Redemption of the Champion”. This picture, not published with that original essay, but now included in a book of Parks’s photographs of Ali, shows the photographer finding a way to express what he saw as the fighter’s inner peace and strength. A surprising image of the “motormouth” at the time, it now looks an entirely natural portrait of the man Ali was to become.Gordon Parks: Muhammad Ali is out now (Steidl, £45).

He tells us that he has never been “worried or embarrassed about being short or lacking in physical strength. But I was utterly miserable about my skin.” Cruel schoolmates dubbed him “Crater Face”. The affliction persisted through university. “The psychological damage, the damage to my self-confidence, was considerable and lasted for years.” It was compounded by his parents breaking up after many years of terrible rows and acute bronchial asthma destroying his dreams of becoming a professional tennis player. The young Bercow was “an insecure, sad, lost soul” and “an angry young man”.It has often struck me that a large proportion of our senior politicians were psychologically wounded when young and seek out the political stage in the hope of gaining the approbation denied to them as children. In few is this as obvious as in the case of the former Speaker. This is memoir as both therapy and revenge. Vengeance on all those who have crossed him during a contentious career. Therapy by trumpeting to the world that “Crater Face” defied those bullying classmates by rising to occupy parliament’s high chair for a decade.It was a peculiar journey. The young Bercow’s first allegiance was to the repulsive right. In his late teens, he made what he now calls a “shameful and obnoxious” decision to join the Monday Club, an ugly outfit that shared his father’s adoration for Enoch Powell and championed white minority dictatorship in South Africa and what was then Rhodesia. “Here I was, a Jewish boy… sidling up to racists.”He was less extreme, but still a man very much of the right, when he got to the Commons at his third attempt and adopted the role of attention-seeking, hyperactive backbench “attack dog”, barking loudly but ineffectively at the Labour government of Tony Blair. This is another period of his life that he now contemplates with mortification.Then a new Bercow emerged, one increasingly out of sympathy with the Tories. So much so that he was sounded out about defecting to Labour. He describes his transformation from Europe-hating “rightwing Thatcherite” to “liberal leftie” more than he explains it. The reader is left unclear to what extent this unusual conversion was influenced by his tempestuous on-off relationship with the Labour-supporting Sally. She eventually became his wife only to later humiliate him by having an affair with one of his cousins.Though he doesn’t explicitly acknowledge this, he redirected his ambitions towards the Speakership when he realised that he had little chance of frontbench advancement and secured the chair against the wishes of David Cameron and with the help of Labour MPs.The book argues persuasively that he was a reforming Speaker who strove to modernise the Commons. He overcame the resistance of the fogeyish tendency to establish a nursery for the use of MPs with small children. He joined the fight to improve staff pay and conditions. MPs on maternity leave gained the right to vote by proxy. He played a critical role in the inspirational appointment of Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who became a charismatic ambassador for parliament as its first female and first non-white chaplain. This was one of several appointments that helped make Westminster look a little more like the country that it is supposed to represent. He claims deserved credit for being generous in the granting of “urgent questions”, which the opposition can use to force ministers to answer to the Commons at times when they would prefer to hide from scrutiny.His Speakership was also a blighted one, accompanied by mounting allegations that there was a bullying culture in parliament on his watch and that he was guilty of it himself. He has been accused of bullying two of his private secretaries, Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair. Lord Lisvane, who served as clerk of the Commons under Bercow, recently submitted a formal complaint to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which is understood to accuse him of bullying and humiliating staff. Lt-Gen David Leakey, a former Black Rod who clashed with Bercow, has made further accusations of intimidation and terrorising behaviour, saying: “He would fly into a rage, the red mist would descend… jumping up and down and bawling out.”Bercow denies he is a bully and in this book presents himself as the victim of scheming officials. They, he claims, wanted to take over the Speaker’s office to pack it “with their Oxbridge-educated clones” and promote their own influence.We can safely say that he has a temper, and it can be a nasty one, because it was often displayed from the Speaker’s chair. He made some unnecessary enemies among MPs by being spectacularly rude to those with whom he tangled in the chamber. This fed the accusation that he was less the Commons’ neutral “umpire” and more a self-regarding showboater driven by a craving to be the star of the parliamentary show. Always quick to rebuke MPs and ministers who went on too long, this was not a rule he extended to his own frequent and windy interventions. “Mum would joke that Dad would never use one word where one hundred would do, and I have inherited that prolixity.” You can say that again – and he does: “Brevity is not my strong suit.” The voice of this book will be familiar to those who have seen Bercow bloviating from the Speaker’s throne: verbose, often repetitious, frequently mottled with rage and in love with the sound of himself. “I make no apology for telling the truth” is a typical example of self-puffing prose.The book is disappointingly short of stories about political life that might be revealing or amusing to the general reader. When he does tell an anecdote, it is invariably self-serving. There is a game of tennis with Boris Johnson. Bercow archly tells us: “He took his 6-0 6-0 6-0 defeat with very good grace.”Unspeakable is stronger when he defends his controversial procedural rulings during the long parliamentary battles over Brexit. He makes a compelling case that he had a duty as Speaker to help the legislature to assert its rights against an executive attempting to railroad Brexit legislation.Many in his former party hate him for that – and he hates them right back. While commending “moderation and good humour in the use of language”, he displays neither quality in a series of poison pen portraits of senior Conservatives. William Hague is “buttoned-up, inscrutable, a cold fish… impersonal, mechanical… a weirdo… a hack and an ex-teenage nerd”. Michael Howard’s “peculiar distinction was to combine coldness and oiliness in equal measure”. Andrea Leadsom, another to accuse him of bullying, is “bigoted”, “deluded”, “feeble and sinister”. Johnson is “a passably adequate politician in an age not replete with them”.He is most splenetic about Cameron: “born with a silver trolley service in his mouth”. The former prime minister gets the wrathful loathing of a state-educated, prickly outsider towards a public school-educated, smoothie insider. “Insubstantial, lightweight, someone who saw politics as a game that it was his inherited duty, and right, to play and win… sniffy, supercilious and deeply snobbish.”These judgments on other politicians are as unsubtle as his loud neckwear. They would be a better read if they had been written with more wit and nuance. There’s nothing original in the suggestion that Michael Gove is “oleaginous” nor fresh about describing Theresa May as “dull as ditchwater”. And when he pronounces one rival guilty of “medal-winning pomposity”, his fellow politicians will collapse with laughter at Bercow’s epic lack of self-awareness.• Unspeakable: The Autobiography by John Bercow is published by W\u0026ampN (£20).

Treat them like a real-life virus• Adam Kucharski is an epidemiologist and authorWhen reports of a new coronavirus emerged last month, I speculated with fellow epidemiologists about what the media might end up naming the infection. None of us would have guessed that within a week or so a theory would be circulating that coronavirus was a new kind of “snake flu”– mostly because it’s unlikely the virus originated in snakes, and it’s not flu.So where did the snakes come from? The culprit was a widely shared scientific paper, which speculated that the new virus had genetic characteristics and implicated snakes as the source. Leading geneticists were quick to point out that the results weren’t convincing, and that bats were still the likely suspects. However, that didn’t stop snake flu from going viral. Other misinformation about coronavirus has rippled across the internet in recent weeks. From claims the virus is part-HIV to conspiracy theories about bioweapons and reports suggesting the virus was linked to people eating bat soup, stories sparking fear seem to have overtaken the outbreak in real life. Is misinformation really more contagious than the virus itself?It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.We typically think of viral content as a chain reaction: you share something with friends, they share it with their friends, and so on. In disease outbreak analysis, we can measure the transmission of an infection by looking at how many additional cases each infected person creates on average during each of these steps. We call this the “reproduction number”, and for coronavirus, we estimate it’s about 2 for a typical infected case in China. What about the reproduction number for online content? A couple of years ago, Facebook researchers looked at the most shared content on the platform from 2014 to 2016, including viral trends such as the ice-bucket challenge and putting an equals sign over your profile picture to support marriage equality.Remarkably, there wasn’t much difference in the transmission. Researchers found the reproduction number was about 2 for all of them. Remember, these were the most shared ideas on Facebook the vast majority of online content is lucky to get even a single repost.To fully explain how viral content – and viruses – spread, we need to move away from the idea that outbreaks involve simple clockwork infections, passing along a chain from person to person to person until large numbers have been exposed. During the 2015 outbreak of the Mers coronavirus in South Korea, 82 out of 186 infections came from a single “superspreading event” in a hospital where an infected person was being treated. It’s not yet clear how common such superspreading is in the current outbreak, but we do know that these kinds of events are how information goes viral online most outbreaks on Twitter are dominated by a handful of iniduals or media outlets, which are responsible for a large proportion of transmission. If you heard about snake flu, you might have told a couple of friends meanwhile, newspaper headlines were telling millions.When tackling disease outbreaks, health agencies often work to identify potential superspreading events, isolating infected iniduals to prevent further transmission. However, this isn’t the only way to stop an outbreak. As well as tracking down people who are infectious, it’s possible to target broader social interactions that might amplify transmission. For example, many cities in China have recently closed schools, which can be hotspots for respiratory infections.Tech companies are now adopting similar approaches to tackle health misinformation. Last year, Pinterest announced it had rewired its search results to make it harder to find vaccine misinformation. It had struggled to remove the content completely – the equivalent of finding all the cases during a disease outbreak – so instead focused on reducing how many people might be exposed to harmful content. During the current outbreak, Google is attempting to reduce people’s susceptibility to misinformation by displaying links to reputable health sources when users search for information about the virus.These combined approaches, which target different aspects of transmission, have long been used in disease control. By introducing analogous strategies online, we should have a better chance of effectively curbing harmful viral content.Ensuring the public has the best possible health information is crucial during an outbreak. At best, misinformation can distract from important messages. At worst, it can lead to behaviour that amplifies disease transmission. The novelty of coronavirus makes the challenge even greater, because viral speculation can easily overwhelm the limited information we do have. The scientific community is already making huge progress in understanding the infection, but we’ve had to start at the bottom, without stacks of earlier research to stand on. When it comes to stopping the outbreak, we’ll need ladders, not snakes.• Adam Kucharski an epidemiologist and the author of The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why They Stop, published on 13 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08099cdbf03cb1f27a8cf0226d2123b958d0cf46/0_260_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4434b240aaeff35d73dc71761245c518","title":"american dirt jeanine cummins cultural appropriation","story":"Condemning a white novelist for writing on Mexican migrants is to create gated cultures‘What insults my soul,” Zadie Smith has written, “is the idea… that we can and should write only about people who are fundamentally ‘like’ us: racially, sexually, genetically, nationally, politically, personally.”Both as novelist and essayist, Smith is one of the most subtle guides to the fraught terrain of culture and identity. The problem of “cultural appropriation” – writers and artists being called out for having stepped beyond their permitted cultural boundaries to explore themes about people who are not “fundamentally ‘like’ us” – is an issue that particularly troubles her. Too often these days, on opening a book or on viewing a painting, we are as likely to ask: “Did the author or painter have the cultural right to engage with that subject?” or: “Does he or she possess the right identity?” as: “Is it any good?”So it is with the latest cultural firestorm over Jeanine Cummins’s novel American Dirt, which tells the story of a mother and son, Lydia and Luca, forced to flee their home in Acapulco and join the migrant trail to America after their family is slaughtered by a drugs cartel. Cummins wants Americans to stop seeing migrants as a “faceless brown mass” and to bear witness to the “tragedy of our making on our southern border”.The novel’s supporters have hailed it as a Great American Novel, even the new The Grapes of Wrath. Its detractors point to the fact that Cummins is non-Mexican and that this wasn’t a story that was hers to tell, which is why she gets it all wrong.Cummins’s critics are right that, as a work of fiction, American Dirt is shoddy and unconvincing. Its plot is as obvious as a narco gangster’s threat, the characterisations flat and the dialogue has all the depth of an episode of CSI. A detective at the bloody scene of the murder of Lydia’s family asks her whether she has anywhere to go. “Please don’t concern ourselves with our wellbeing,” Lydia responds. “Serve justice. Worry about that.” Even a CSI scriptwriter might be embarrassed.Most of the anger about the novel has been generated, though, not by how Cummins writes but by who she is. Not Mexican. Not migrant. White.Cummins herself sets up her critics’ argument in an author’s note: “I worried that as a non-migrant and non-Mexican I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico, set almost entirely among migrants.” She “wished someone slightly browner than me would write it”.What both sides seem to have forgotten is what fiction is for. Fiction, as Smith observed in the inaugural Philip Roth lecture in 2016, “is a way of asking… what if I was different than I am?” Today, though, she notes elsewhere: “The old – and never especially helpful – adage write what you know has morphed into something more like a threat: stay in your lane.” To do so, Smith insists, is to deny the very possibility of fiction.Cummins’s critics argue that this is to misunderstand their point. They are not forbidding white authors from writing about Mexican migrants, simply condemning a white writer writing so badly about the subject. But introducing Cummins’s whiteness as an issue is inevitably to shift attention away from the quality of the work and on to the nature of the author’s identity.In any case, the context of the debate is a literary and artistic culture that increasingly does insist that people should stay in their lanes. “Where did the new orthodoxy arise that writers must only set stories within their own country of origin or nationality?” the writer Aminatta Forna has asked. In trying to constrain the imagination by identity, she points out, it’s not the privileged but those on the margins who most lose out. The “white male writer” is called simply “writer” all other others have to be “hyphenated”, writing, in Nesrine Malik’s words, “as a”: as a woman, as a Muslim, as an immigrant.Certainly, puncture the absurd hype around American Dirt as a novel that reveals the truth about the treatment of immigrants. Certainly, celebrate the Mexican and Latinx writers, from Luis Alberto Urrea to Valeria Luiselli (whose poetic, haunting Lost Children Archive has just been published in paperback), who have long explored the stories of migration with subtlety and power.But let us not create gated cultures in which only those of the right identity have permission to use their imaginations. For, as novelist Kamila Shamsie tweeted (in response to another controversy over cultural appropriation): “ ‘You – other – are unimaginable’ is a far more problematic attitude than ‘You are imaginable’.” She might have added, “even if imagined badly”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d4cff7be3f2b0b9abcd462fae22f00a1afece15/0_793_4559_2734/master/4559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cc9c53f2d008957b2f416b8027ecab2","title":"on my radar david lans madonna nuri bilge ceylan golborne road message in a bottle black jeans","story":"The theatre director on Madonna’s Madame X tour, the film-maker who reminds him of Tolstoy and why he always wears black jeansBorn in South Africa, David Lan trained as an actor before gaining a PhD in social anthropology at the London School of Economics.

My favourite local restaurant is Zayane, run by the Mortell family from Casablanca: their tagines sizzle almost all the way to the last bite.Ceylan makes the kind of film where you go, “No, honestly, I can’t face a three-hour, glacially slow, landscape-driven work of genius that opens out into being about everything that matters in the modern world. C’mon let’s see Psycho one more time.” But then you think, “If I don’t watch Once Upon a Time in Anatolia or Winter Sleep tonight, maybe tomorrow Armageddon will arrive and I’ll die the poorer for it” – so you do and you have the best evening of cinema you can imagine. The Wild Pear Tree is his latest invisibly crafted submersion into the psyche of contemporary Turkey. It’s as folksy and civilised as Tolstoy.Message in a Bottle, Peacock theatre, LondonDo art houses die when they lose connection to the street? Probably. Contrariwise, street artists are keen to blast their way into art houses, if only because a box office is a more efficient way to earn a living than passing round a hat. For two decades, Sadler’s Wells’s Breakin’ Convention weekend has been a revelatory festival of hip-hop, the spectacular dance form born on the streets of the Bronx in the 1970s. In Message in a Bottle, choreographed by Kate Prince to old favourites by Sting, the exuberance of the street is all there, but in this tale of the journeys of three refugees, the young dancers’ heartstopping technique ripens into emotional resonance and meaning.Maybe 35 years ago I saw my friend, the actor Roger Rees, in a show. I’ve no memory of the show but I do remember he was wearing stylish black jeans. I’ve been wearing black jeans ever since, not in homage to Roger, but because it means I can wear the same trousers wherever and whenever. The idea of clothes that draw attention to yourself is repellent: surely the point of couture is to enable you to disappear. Occasionally I have to go to some formal do and get out the tux, but all the men are wearing the same monkey suits, so you can disappear just as effectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230991959691554728c46278e8bbd4684402103e/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6729dd661e0866c9b392a9765d49696","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce. Identify one metric to improve upon, set a deadline, and keep track of the progress.Empower your business.

So if you’re reading this before seeing the film, and you’ve managed to avoid the whirlwind of publicity it has attracted since winning the Palme d’Or last May, it may be simpler to just stop and head straight to the cinema. Because, at the risk of adding to the hype, Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going such a joy. I saw it for the fourth time last week and I’m now desperate to view the black-and-white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival.Described by its creator as “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains”, Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian – a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong’s back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), in their lowly semi-basement home, hunting for stray wifi coverage and leaving their windows open to benefit from bug-killing street fumigation. They have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family.An architectural wonder perched high above the slums of Seoul, with views not of urinating drunks but of luxurious lawns and starlit skies, this wealthy house is everything the Kims’ pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. It’s a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), who stayed with the building after its original architect owner moved out. Spying an opening, Ki-woo (newly dubbed “Kevin”) realises that his own family could easily fill such roles, and hatches a plan that will inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks.Beyond the deliberate ambiguity of the title (which, like Jordan Peele’s oddly comparable Us, cuts both ways), Bong once again foregrounds a distrust of wealth and authority that has been a recurrent feature of his work since his 2003 breakout Memories of Murder, continuing through films as erse as The Host, Mother, Okja and, of course, Snowpiercer, to which Parasite contains several knowing nods.The Kim family may live in sewage-flooded squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of “people who ride the subway”. Similarly, while the smug Mr Park is habitually depicted ascending the stairs of his ultra-modern home, and the Kims are pictured scampering down city steps to their own underworld apartment, it’s clear who holds the dramatic high ground.When it comes to deception, too, those on the upper rungs of the societal ladder are as practised as those upon whom they look down. In a world of vertical non-integration, Parasite finds gasp-inducing depths lurking beneath even the most apparently placid surfaces. Yet Bong is careful to keep his opposing forces keenly balanced, creating the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot test in which the audience is invited to decide for themselves the precise meaning of these strangely symmetrical apparitions.Perfectly accompanying the film’s tonal shifts is Jung Jae-il’s magnificently modulated music, which moves from the sombre piano patterns of the curtain-raiser, through the mini symphony of The Belt of Faith to the cracked craziness of cues in which choric vocals do battle with a musical saw. Just as the action can segue from slapstick to horror and back – sometimes within the space of a single scene – so Jung plays things straight even as madness beckons, ensuring that the underlying elements of pathos are amplified rather than undercut by pastiche.For me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won’s multitonal script, it’s a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8966358789426b0ff96f12e2632c075fcf63e36/0_597_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa007fb38468f7dd81471452a9053dc","title":"annalisa barbieri notes on chocolate valentines day","story":"Red foil often hides bad chocolate, but these are the romantically themed sweets worth seeking outThe mere words Valentine’s Day make me contrary.

The 43-year-old chef had just opened Temper, a barbecue joint in Soho built around a six metre-long fire pit, which was the biggest in London and perhaps in any restaurant anywhere. Whole beasts were brought in, butchered and grilled theatrically in thick slabs over the embers. As the Observer’s Jay Rayner noted (admiringly): “There is a menu, but they could just replace it with a massive sign stamped with the word MEAT!, alongside one of those comedy boxing gloves on an extending arm which keeps punching you in the face until you surrender.”Rankin was in many respects an obvious target for vegan ire. With his elaborate tatts, brawny forearms and trucker cap, he was a poster boy for the strange but powerful barbecue fixation that took hold a few years ago before Temper, he worked variously as a chef at Pitt Cue Co, Smokehouse and Bad Egg. He’d also just spent two years smoking, braising and grilling to produce a bible for carnivores titled Low and Slow: How to Cook Meat. “I’ve cooked 15 goats all at once,” Rankin says, flecks of Edinburgh in his voice. “I’ve butchered many animals in my time.”So when the vegans came after him on social media, Rankin wasn’t surprised or especially bothered. Those at the “extremist” end, he ignored – “There’s no grey area,” he reasoned, “you’re evil, you’re wrong, that’s it” – but others, he’d debate. One in particular, a university lecturer on food issues, he became friendly with and they went out for dinner. Rankin pointed out that, unlike most steakhouses, his use of entire carcasses respected animals and minimised offcuts, but on certain issues he was swayed. “I was part of a group of people who made barbecue big again in the UK and I’m not too sure if that was a good thing,” he concedes now. “It was an interesting eye-opener to my own ethics and what I was doing.”Rankin is telling me this in a vegan restaurant. His zero-waste vegan restaurant, in fact: Simplicity Burger on Brick Lane in east London, across the street from the famous bagel shops. When we meet, he’s almost completed Veganuary. Rankin estimates that he probably hasn’t bought meat to cook at home for two-and-a-half years. It’s like Richard Dawkins confiding that maybe he was a bit hasty writing off the whole God thing.Plant-based food is now even raiding the spiritual castle of the meat pie: the football ground. When Chelsea played Arsenal last month, supporters at Stamford Bridge could warm themselves at half-time with a vegan doner kebab or buffalo cauli wings at the Premier League’s first fully vegan kiosk.Much of the demand in the fast-food sector is for fake burgers, with restaurants lasciviously telling vegans and flexitarians – meat-reducers, essentially – that theirs “ooze” and “bleed” just like the real thing. Anyone doubting there is serious money in this sector need only look at the US company Beyond Meat, which supplies smaller UK chains such as Honest, Neat Burger and Halo Burger but also All Bar Ones, Premier Inns and Toby Carverys. In July last year, Beyond Meat briefly had a market valuation of $11.7bn (£9bn).When Rankin set out to make his plant-based Simplicity Burger he did not want to make a product that would appeal to vegans. That was thinking far too small. He wanted to craft a burger with such deep umami notes that anyone and everyone would find it delicious. “Eight months at home, just doing weird stuff with mushrooms and things like that,” Rankin recalls. “I got the flavour really early on it was the texture that was the hardest thing to get. There were times when I was pulling my hair out. Times I gave up. But when I finally nailed it, that was a good feeling. I was like, ‘Thank god I didn’t have to add some weird chemical.’”Rankin is in some senses a late arrival at the plant-based party. But the difference, he believes, is that he has approached the challenge as a chef, not as a food scientist, wellness guru or tech entrepreneur. For example, the cheese for the Simplicity Burger could have been a simple vegan cheese: it might not have tasted of much, but it would have melted and provided a familiar texture. Instead, Rankin decided to extract the liquid from vegan cheese and replace it with fermented tomato water, fried onion oil and pickle juice. The result is quite mind-bending: it’s cheese that tastes not of cheese, but faintly of a cheeseburger.The reason that many chefs have been slow to engage with vegan food, Rankin suggests, is hubris. “Because it’s not cool,” he says. “I’ve taken a lot of flak for it. I get laughed at. I go to these little chef things and they go, ‘How’s your vegan thing? Haha!’ And I’m like, ‘How’s your restaurant that does fuck all for nobody apart from your own ego?’”Still, Rankin knows, from years sweating over a fire pit, how deep and primal our love of meat is and how difficult it will be to convince the doubters. “There’s a cultural identity to it,” says Rankin. “If you take that scene in Pulp Fiction, where Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta come into the room and he’s eating the burger and he tries it and says, ‘This is a tasty burger…’ You can’t replace that scene with a falafel and get away with it.”Rankin’s Simplicity Burger is indeed a tasty burger. The first mouthful delivers a dense, satisfying umami whoomph I haven’t tasted before from plant-based fast food. That’s not to imply that I’m tricked into thinking I’m eating a beef burger: it doesn’t fall apart in your mouth in quite the same way. But that’s not a criticism of Rankin it’s just an acknowledgment that replicating meat is an outsize, maybe even impossible, culinary and scientific challenge.When you put a ground beef in a hot pan, there’s immediately a reaction between amino acids and simple sugars that form complex flavour compounds. The meat browns – the Maillard reaction – and creates more than 4,000 different molecules, which are responsible for its distinctive look, texture, smell and flavour. Humans have found the taste of cooked meat irresistible for approximately two-and-a-half million years. Eating animals is the main reason our brains developed and our stomachs shrank and we no longer had to spend all day foraging for food.Van der Molen, who is 47 years old and favours the Branson-casual entrepreneur uniform of open-necked shirt and running shoes, had no previous experience in the food industry his other company, Ecozone, makes detergents. But he had an itch to try something different and he was hearing a lot of noise from the States about Beyond Meat and market leader Impossible Foods, which was founded by Pat Brown, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University, and has a stated aim to make animal agriculture and deep-sea fishing redundant by 2035. Van der Molen also had personal reasons.“I went to the doctors and I had cholesterol at 6.9 and the doctor told me to stop eating burgers,” he recalls when we meet at the Moving Mountains co-working office in Chiswick. “Otherwise I was going to end up on statins all my life. So I went straight to the supermarket and, as you can imagine back in 2015, it wasn’t very tasty: the burgers were bean burgers, nut burgers. And for someone who has gone from eating a quarter pounder that’s juicy and succulent, having a burger that looks like a squashed falafel is just too much of a step.”In this regard, Van der Molen thinks he is typical. His research suggests that most Moving Mountains customers are either aged 15 to 25, “doing it for the environment and animal welfare”, or between 45 and 65 and driven by health reasons. “Because their doctors told them like they told me,” says Van der Molen. Women significantly outnumber men.The Moving Mountains B12 burger was a hit. It was launched in February 2018 at Mildreds, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant in Dalston, east London, but there was a mainstream crossover in September when all of Marston’s 400-plus food pubs began offering it. In 2019, Harvester followed, then Europe’s Hard Rock Cafes and the massive pub operators Stonegate and Mitchells \u0026amp Butlers.Their secret? “Four words we never mention: vegan, vegetarian, meatless, meat-free,” says Van der Molen. “We have to be so firm sometimes with restaurants, top companies such as Hard Rock Cafe. Call it the Moving Mountains burger. Meat-free and meatless are all about what is missing from the product: ‘Meat free? What’s in it then? I don’t want it.’ So we want to promote this as plant-based meat. Even though it’s not technically meat, we can still call it what we want. And we want to promote what’s good about it, not what’s lacking.”This, Van der Molen contends, differentiates his product from, say, the Greggs vegan sausage roll and meatless steak bake. “A vegan sausage roll – again, you’re limiting it to the amount of people who are going to buy it,” says Van der Molen. “I have friends that would never go to Greggs and ask for the vegan sausage roll because they never ever want to use the word ‘vegan’ when they’re with their mates. And it’s the same in restaurants. They don’t want to say it. It’s still old school. It’s sissy. You don’t want to be associated with vegan.”Van der Molen always saw Moving Mountains as restaurant only. “I don’t really like supermarkets, what can I say?” he says, with a smirk. “I’ve worked with them most of my life.” He mellowed, however, and in late December last year, three of Moving Mountains’ plant-based products – a sausage burger, sausage and hot dog, though not the regular burger – became available in the frozen food aisle of Sainsbury’s.Plant-based is here to stay, insists Van der Molen, and will be a global phenomenon. Moving Mountains already sells in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, but Van der Molen is eager this year to take on Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat in the US. He has especially high hopes for the Moving Mountains hot dog, which has a main ingredient of sunflower seeds. “No one’s been able to replicate that,” he says. “So where will the plant-based market and Moving Mountains be in two years? We probably could be meeting in New York, I think.”As you enter Unity Diner in Spitalfields, east London, there is a large neon sign that reads: “The future is vegan.” On the menu, there are lots of ingredients my spellcheck is not happy about – cheeze, chikken, bakon and prawnz – as well as the Moving Mountains burger and hot dog. You can wash it down with a gin cocktail called Piers Morgan’s Tears, served with a straw made from wheat stems.I order the burger and my companion, Illtud Llyr Dunsford, selects a Moving Mountains hot dog with added prawnz: vegan surf’n’turf. If Rankin would be near the bottom of the list of people that you would expect to go into the market for meat alternatives, then Dunsford, a jolly, curious 39-year-old with a warm smile, isn’t far behind. His family has been farming in the Gwendraeth Valley, west Wales, for more than 300 years. Dunsford, meanwhile, was so inspired by the nose-to-tail philosophy of St John chef Fergus Henderson that in 2011 he set up a company called Charcutier with the aim of making world-class air-dried ham from Welsh pedigree pigs. Dunsford knows his hot dogs, too: he used to supply them for Harrods. “One of my nicknames back then was the Sausage Dude,” he says. “Don’t know if that’s a good nickname or not.”So what does Dunsford make of the Moving Mountains hot dog? “That’s surprisingly good,” he says, fighting an admirable battle to keep ketchup out of his thick, reddish-brown beard. “It tastes like a commodity product, a cheap product, the texture is a little bit too hard, but for me if this was a street-corner product it replaces it quite easily.”Praise then, but qualified. Dunsford can see scenarios in which plant-based simulacra can fill a gap – and for the planet that has to be so – but the notion that they can replace the real thing entirely is a stretch too far. “For me as a meat eater, there’s an organoleptic quality when you consume meat,” he says. “And none of these plant-based products offers exactly the same response. You don’t quite have that little glob of hot fat going down your chin you get with real meat.”For this reason, Dunsford believes the future of meat has to be growing it in labs from animal cells. His long, at times confounding journey to this conclusion began in 2015, when he attended a symposium on cultured meat at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and continued when he was chosen as a prestigious Nuffield farming scholar and spent 15 months travelling the world to explore the future of meat production, which included seeing the impact of animal agriculture on deforestation in the Amazon. But it all fell into place in late 2017, in the San Francisco headquarters of a US company Just, Inc (a building where Dunsford, a film buff, notes that Toy Story was screened for the first time).“They cooked me up a little duck liver chorizo,” he remembers. “It was in a little taco, it was tiny. And I ate it and it just had the umami kick of what I expect from meat. It was like this final piece of the jigsaw for me: this actually tastes exactly the same as meat. I thought, ‘Well, if you could produce that product cheaper, why on earth would a consumer buy something else instead?’”Charcutier was wound down and Dunsford now runs Cellular Agriculture, the first UK startup in the cell-based meat space, with Dr Marianne Ellis, whose day job is head of chemical engineering at the University of Bath. “Our machine at the moment produces milligrams worth of cells, so very, very small,” says Dunsford. “But by the end of the next two years, we’re looking at about 10 kilos for a cycle, which is about three weeks. And the aspiration really, in around five years, is to build factories that produce tonnages of cells.”As an inidual, Dunsford accepts that he should be the perfect target for meat alternatives: he buys local he cares about sustainability when he takes a flight, he offsets his carbon. “So I’m that kind of consumer and I’ve tried to do plant-based but I can’t,” he sighs. “It’s just my body and my mind are not strong enough. Even though I know there are a certain number of things that we need to do to help the planet, I’m weak. Most people are.”So Rankin doesn’t think lab-grown meat will find a market then? “Oh, I’m sure it will take off, but I’m just saying it’s going to be terrible for us,” he warns. “You look at history and as soon as we started to get labs or companies to do our diets for us or to feed us food it turned out incredibly badly every single time.”Van der Molen looked into cell-based meat before starting Moving Mountains. For him, the issue was not ethics, but timescale. “I met with the University of Bath and, as soon as I understood what was involved, I stopped that,” he says. Why? “It’s another 10 years away from now, I would guess, from being produced. Anyone who tells you it’s this year is wanting more money from a funding round in my opinion. And as well as caring for the planet, I’m also a businessman. I need to have a company and I need to get the company moving.”Still, Van der Molen agrees with Dunsford that ultimately the market for cell-based meat will far outstrip that of the plant-based sector. “A lot of people say, ‘Well, I won’t eat it’ and I say, ‘But you just might not have a choice, because these massive big meat producers will just force it upon you.’ They don’t necessarily care about the environment – though some certainly do – but the savings that they can possibly make from using cell-based as opposed to rearing cattle? Unbelievable.”For Dunsford, the breakthrough product will likely be a hybrid of cell- and plant-based ingredients. “Because the cells actually taste of meat and plant-based doesn’t,” he says. “You have to think about things like a fish cake: a lot of that is potatoes. Think of a sausage, a lot of that is just filler. So it is the same principle as what we currently do with food products.”Everyone agrees – some with zeal, others resignation – that it’s not if meat production will change, but when and how. In 2016, Dunsford was asked by advisers at Downing Street to present his research on protein alternatives. At the end of the day, he walked down the Strand to catch his tube and started humming David Bowie’s Space Oddity. “The line ‘Take your protein pill…’ came into my mind,” Dunsford recalls. “And I was like, ‘That’s what I want to do next. I want to make a sausage in space! I want to build a system that will exist for space travel and for planet colonisation!’ That’s what will come of this technology.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b29497b9171b57bc16ace7c402aa5bca5f759faf/0_0_5366_3220/master/5366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30a552218070cbe55f0e45344d591894","title":"nigel slater dinner roll bread recipes rye treacle feta kefir focaccia","story":"Slices of sourdough have a place, but there’s no better start to dinner than a dark rye roll – unless it’s a soft white one with fetaThick chunks of bread, textured and chewy, have been cut from a vast loaf and are on their way to our table. There’s a little dish of butter on the side, as pale and soft as Mr Whippy, that will soon be speckled with the loaf’s blackened crust. A fine loaf is a good start to any dinner, but I have to admit to missing the wicker basket of rolls that used to accompany a meal in a restaurant. The plump little bubbles of dough that appeared, peeping at us from under their snow-white linen napkin. I loved digging in with my thumbs and tearing my chosen roll apart, buttering each ripped morsel in turn. And although it was rarely the best of bread, it was nevertheless all mine. A whole, fat little cherub of dough all to myself.I can’t remember the last time I was offered a bread roll in a restaurant, so this week I made my own. Two actually. One, a dark, oat-flecked rye-flour version. The other, soft and slightly oily to the touch, like focaccia, but with nuggets of sheep’s cheese.We ate the brown rolls with fillets of smoked trout and mayonnaise that was vivid green with chopped dill and parsley. The soft rolls were split and filled with crisp-fleshed winter tomatoes dressed with a mustardy olive oil and curly Turkish pickled chillies. Those we didn’t eat on the day we toasted, dipping each one into olive oil and then into a powder of crushed toasted hazelnuts, sesame, paprika and ground coriander seeds.These rolls prove more slowly than usual because of the cold kefir. Speed things up by using a warm bowl and by warming the flour in the oven for a few minutes before adding the yeast and liquid.You will also need a rectangular baking dish or bread tin, approximately 25 x 16cm. Makes 6 rollsTo finish:olive oil a littlethyme and rosemary a few sprigsPut the flour, yeast and salt in a large, warm mixing bowl. Put the kefir in a jug, add the olive oil and the warm water and stir well. Combine the kefir mixture and flour with a wooden spoon or your hands and mix until you have a soft and slightly sticky dough.Crumble the feta into a small bowl. Remove the leaves from the rosemary and thyme and finely chop them to give you 1½ tbsp, and add to the crumbled cheese.If you are making the dough by hand, tip on to a floured board and knead the cheese and herbs into it. If you prefer the easy way, use a food mixer fitted with a dough hook to knead the cheese and herbs into the dough. Continue kneading for a couple of minutes, adding a little more flour if necessary to stop it sticking, then put the dough back in its bowl, cover with a clean, warm cloth and put it in a warm place. Leave the dough in peace until it has risen to almost twice its original size.Line a deep-sided baking tin with a piece of baking parchment.Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces then shape each one into a round bun. Place the buns in the baking tin, three down each side, then return to the warm place, cover with the cloth and leave for about 30 minutes, until nicely risen and touching one another.Set the oven at 220Cgas mark 8. Toss the herbs in the olive oil and scatter them over the rolls then bake for about 20 minutes, until lightly golden brown.The dark and faintly liquorice note here makes these rolls a perfect match for smoked fish. For once, I suggest salted butter.Makes 8 rollsLine the baking or cake tin with a piece of baking parchment.Mix together the two flours, dried yeast and salt. Stir the hot water and black treacle together then combine with the flours, sunflower and pumpkin seeds and the rolled oats. When thoroughly combined, knead either by hand on a floured board or using an electric food mixer with a dough hook. The hand method will take about 6 minutes. Using a machine, just a couple of minutes on moderate speed.Transfer the bowl to a warm place, cover with a clean cloth and leave for an hour or so, until the dough has almost doubled in size.Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a lightly floured board. Add the chopped walnuts and lightly knead them into the dough. Cut the ball of dough into eight, then shape each into a ball. Place them, almost touching, in a round baking tin or cake tin about 22cm in diameter. Scatter the surface with a few oats and seeds and put in a warm place, covered by a clean cloth and leave until the rolls have risen and are touching one another.Preheat the oven to 220Cgas mark 8. Put the rolls in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until the surface is crisp and they sound hollow when tapped. Turn out and leave to cool. (Though it has to be said they are delicious eaten warm.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc14e880cda494811e793af7465dcf0f3d6bee4d/0_86_3276_1965/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e11da7fe06a5d987c84eb58c3334e0ea","title":"premier league netflix tv sports rights","story":"The Premier League will eventually sell matches on a Netflix-style channel, its new chief executive, Richard Masters, has said. Masters confirmed that the Premier League had considered launching its own digital service – streaming live games and other content directly – in some countries during the TV bidding process for the 2019-22 seasons.He confirmed such an option – which would allow the Premier League to charge directly for a “Premflix”channel rather than sell the rights to TV companies – was on the table for the 2022-25 seasons.“During the last process we spent quite a lot of time and invested a lot of recourse in building out our expertise and capacity in ‘direct consumer’,” said Masters. “We considered whether it would be the right time to test a few markets and decided not to. But we are going to continue for the planning phase in the next commercial term to build out those capabilities.”He added: “We were ready last time and we will be ready next time should the opportunity arise.”The Premier League makes £3.1bn a year from TV rights, of which £1.4bn comes from foreign buyers. However, launching its own streaming service in some territories could lead to substantial rises in revenue. In Singapore, Singtel pays £70m a season to the Premier League, yet it makes £175m a year from subscribers who pay around £35 a month for live games. If the Premier League kept these TV rights for itself it could potentially make another £100m in Singapore alone.The chances of a “Premflix” channel happening in England, where Sky Sports has around six million subscribers and BT Sport close to two million, are slim. But Masters suggested a two-tiered system – with some countries watching games shown by existing TV broadcasters and others streamed directly by the Premier League – was inevitable. “I’m not saying it will happen in the next cycle or when it will happen but eventually the Premier League will move to a mix of direct consumer and media rights sales,” he said. “It is impossible to say when that will be.”Another problem facing Masters is how many foreigners Premier League clubs will be allowed in their 25-man squads after Brexit. Clubs are permitted to have 17 non-homegrown players but the Football Association wants this reduced to 13. Masters believes that anything less than 16 foreigners could damage the league’s standing, as well as the competitiveness of English clubs in Europe.“If you did have a quota system that was vastly different from Europe, you would put our top clubs at a big disadvantage,” he said. “I think the average number of foreign players that the most likely winners of the Champions League have is 16. So, if our clubs were lower than that, it would be a disadvantage to them.”“I’m old enough to remember when England struggled to qualify for World Cups and European Championships and now they barely lose a game. We don’t want to take any risks with the Premier League because it is phenomenally successful.”Masters also warned the Carabao Cup would suffer if Uefa and the European Clubs’ Association agree a deal to expand the Champions League by four games. “There isn’t enough space,” he said. “It’s not an absolute that if somehow the shape of the European competitions changes the Carabao Cup is terminally damaged. There are some clever fixture people out there that may be able to slot the thing together. But it would fundamentally alter its trajectory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58ae90ce9d7ea217fbfd731b7a07ce7121fd5400/0_143_4282_2570/master/4282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2465fb586357b8605b1e3b0a1e2ce253","title":"lionel messi money rudderless barcelona afloat","story":"Sacking of Ernesto Valverde and Messi’s fallout with sporting director Eric Abidal are symptoms of long-term stagnation and disjointed structure at the Camp NouL ast Tuesday, as Lionel Messi lashed out at the club’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, the crisis at Barcelona became official. But this is a story about far more than clashing egos and mismanagement at the Camp Nou. It is a parable of modern football, of the problem with genius and the difficulty of identity.Perhaps the strangest aspect of the saga – sparked by the Argentinian reacting with fury to what he saw as Abidal’s attempt to blame the players for the recent sacking of Ernesto Valverde – is that it has taken so long to reach this point, a reminder that in the modern era super-clubs can be run with staggering ineptitude and still win titles.The disjointedness of Barça’s team structure has been evident for several years. Again and again, opponents in the knockout stages of the Champions League have rampaged through vast spaces in what should have been the midfield. That’s how Paris Saint-Germain beat them 4-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie in 2017, and Juventus thumped them 3-0 in the following round. It’s how Roma and Liverpool have been able to overcome three-goal deficits against them, how even an ordinary Chelsea made them look vulnerable at Stamford Bridge in 2018, albeit the game finished 1-1.A midfield that is variously old, slow and unable to handle the demands of a modern pressing game is the most obvious problem, but it probably isn’t the most troubling. There are two other major issues, both of which cast doubt on core elements of the club’s identity.The first is Messi. A decade ago, he was a willing worker. He might not have been the most voracious presser, but he did his share. In 2009-10, he regained the ball through tackles or interceptions an average of 2.1 times per game in La Liga. That was an exceptional season but in the years that followed 1.2 or 1.3 was standard. Since Pep Guardiola’s departure, those figures have steadily slipped. Last season he was at 0.5 this season 0.8.Messi has always been a minimalist genius – indeed part of his greatness has been his capacity consistently to select the lowest difficulty option – but his work rate has declined with time.That is not necessarily a criticism. It may be that the conservation of energy, his constant low-intensity reconnaissance of the opposition’s defences, is required for him to be so effective at the creative aspects. He is 32 but showing few obvious signs of slowing down in terms of goals or assists. Yet as his genius has papered over the cracks, it is probably also responsible for at least some of those cracks.This is not about casting blame: brilliance can be problematic. When Juventus’s Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala spoke in the run-up to the 2019 Copa América of his struggles to play with Messi, it was widely reported as a rift between the two, but it could equally have been seen as a statement of fact. It can be hard to play with somebody that good because the temptation to just give him the ball is so strong.It is not a coincidence that Barcelona have begun to face similar problems to Argentina. And it is not just on the pitch that Messi’s aura creates imbalances. It is almost impossible for him not to be indulged: which coach would ever drop him, let alone sell him? It’s not just about the political consequences of potentially ostracising him, it is that at any moment in any game, he might suddenly beat four men and lash a shot into the corner and so transform a poor result into a good one. But no player should also be a de facto sporting director.What has exaggerated the problem, with Barcelona and Argentina, is the near total absence of rational leadership. Neither club nor federation, seemingly, has either vision or a plan. That is an issue exacerbated at Barça by the unusual nature of the club and by the difficulty of replacing a coach as extreme and idiosyncratic as Guardiola.Of all Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s many criticisms of Guardiola, the line that remains the most memorable is his description of Barcelona’s players as schoolboys, standing head bowed before the teacher. It was a sneer that contained a deeper truth: what happens when the teacher leaves? What does a class used to obedience to an extremely prescriptive leader, a class that had found it hard to accommodate outsiders, do then?This is the issue for any club that has a clearly defined sense of how it should play once the architect of that style has departed, but it is perhaps particularly acute at Barcelona, where a post-Cruyffian style has become intertwined with Catalan self-identity.Luis Enrique offered a solution of sorts, grafting a celebrity trident on to the side that brought the 2015 Champions League while shifting away from the strictest definition of Guardiola’s philosophy. But Luis Suárez is ageing and injured, while Neymar left to pursue his own ambition, a huge transfer that should have allowed Barça to reconstruct their defence and midfield, but instead led to a pair of vain nine-figure splurges on glamour. The greatest effect of the Neymar deal, as it turned out, was to gift Liverpool the Philippe Coutinho windfall they used to become the best side in the world.So what do Barça do now? Spend more, but this time on the right players? Or try to return to some system of pure guardiolismo?Quique Setién’s possession-driven approach already feels slightly archaic. Devotion to an ideal is never in itself a solution. Brilliant as he is, Guardiola was fortunate at Barça to inherit a squad that included seven high-class players brought up at the club academy who understood his philosophy perfectly and to do so at a time when various changes in the game’s laws and economics had made the world receptive to his revolution.But football has moved on. High pressing and transitions reign. Even Guardiola has evolved. Meanwhile, Barcelona, devoid of leadership, stagnate, sustained only by Messi and their wealth, as the game flows ever further away from them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b9638cf026ff2a7b0c17015133ed440ce0baced/0_261_6555_3932/master/6555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f55457ee87e1c8599261ba970a80ad47","title":"the lost art of having a chat","story":"We are more connected than ever, but we rarely seem to really speak to each other. So,  Rebecca Nicholson decided to tryLike most people I know, my Weekly Screen Report is obscene. Every Sunday, when the notification pops up to tell me the hours I have wasted, mostly texting, I think about all the things I could have done. Finished Middlemarch. Started Middlemarch. But as I have my phone in my hand, I scroll through Instagram instead. I send an article or a joke to a friend, a picture of the dog to the family WhatsApp, catch up on someone else’s night out. Recently, I clocked up – and I’m ashamed as I write this – six hours and 29 minutes of phone usage in a single day. I have had days where I’ve barely been awake that long. Messages is my most used app. I am talking all the time.I know many will welcome this as a kind of freedom. The very idea of talking on the phone invokes horror among those who claim to loathe it. There are thousands of memes explaining the many ways that talking, not texting, is rude, basically criminal. Calling is not time-efficient, ill-suited to the attention economy, where all eyes must be on several screens at once. You can send messages when you’re doing something else – watching The Irishman, or having a bath, or even talking to another person in real life. My dad recently marvelled at me being able to text with two thumbs I marvel at teenagers being able to text while talking to you and not looking at the screen. Once technology gave us the ability to easily screen calls, we ran with it. We can ignore the relative who phones with a list of recent hometown tragedies, the work call we don’t feel like taking, our chattiest of friends who might not let us go for an hour. But what happens if you are that chatty friend?Smart phones are smart enough to tell you that you’re using them too much. The dumb phone is making a comeback. I wondered if it was possible to ride this wave of the digital detox and make a deliberate effort to call instead of text. I wanted to see if it would change my relationships, particularly the ones I had grown lazy about maintaining. The plan was to stay off text and DMs for a solid month. I was fed up of paddling in the shallows. I wanted to swim. If I needed to speak to someone, I’d have to call them.When the writer Elizabeth Wurtzel died in January, a piece she wrote in 2013, about her “one-night stand of a life”, began to circulate again, and it contained one paragraph that hit me particularly hard. “Look at how we live,” she wrote. “We communicate in text messages and emails even those of us old enough to have lived in a world where landline was not a word because it’s all there was have fallen into this lazy substitute for human contact. I have.”Who hasn’t? It should be easier than ever to talk. There are limitless outlets for publishing our thoughts, endless ways to begin a kind of conversation. Voice memos are popular, particularly among young people, but they’re a halfway house, still one-sided. We talk with one eye on efficiency, and it strangles what is so good about it – the spontaneity, the lack of ability to control what happens when two people are rambling on to each other.The psychologist Sherry Turkle has been studying the impact of computers on human psychology since the early 1980s, and in 2015 she published Reclaiming Conversation, in which she referred to “the edited life” that we live now. She spoke to teachers who observed that their students seemed to develop empathetic skills at a slower rate than they would be expected to. “Face-to-face conversation is the most human – and humanising – thing we do,” she wrote. “Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It’s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood.”Are we losing that joy of being heard? Most offices are quieter places than they have ever been. The open-plan rooms I have worked in over the last decade or so are filled with people wearing headphones, silently tapping away on Gchat or Slack. Even workplaces that should invite conversation are making it easier to avoid talking at all. If you stay in a budget hotel, you can check yourself in and out. If you scan your onions on the supermarket’s self- service checkout, you don’t need to chat about what you’re planning to do with them. When it was common enough to be considered a problem, making a phone call on public transport used to be frowned upon. In the early 00s, Dom Joly built a TV career out of shouting “Hello!” into an oversized mobile in public places. Train carriages are now full of heads bowed, illuminated by blue light. A few years ago the Daily Mash ran a much-shared satirical news story: “A northern man has left a trail of terror across London by attempting to interact socially with everyone he meets.” And even in the north, screens have begun to dominate. Quiet carriages are becoming redundant. We are making ourselves quiet.In 2014, someone set up a family WhatsApp group. Before then, I spoke to my family on the phone all the time. Now, we spend more time in touch with each other than ever before, yet I miss them. It’s a noticeboard, more than a conversation. The person I still speak to most often, and for longest, is my nan, who is 83. She has a mobile, but doesn’t text. The other day I phoned to see how she was, and she told me a long story about how she was never supposed to have the name that she has, but there were 23 pubs in the village she was born in, and her father stopped in at most of them on the way to register her birth. By the time he got to the clerk, he’d forgotten what he’d been told to call her, so he named her after the clerk instead.Verbal conversations are unpredictable and unwieldy in a way that those written down are not, because when we type or tap, we are in control, of our side, at least. This ruthless chat efficiency has excised the flab but, I realise, I love the flab. It’s where the excitement happens. I wanted to revive those conversations with everyone. So in my month of no texts, the WhatsApp group would be the first thing to go. I went to delete the app, pressed my finger on the screen, let it wobble – and then I stopped. There was a video of my niece dancing in front of the TV that I wanted to show my partner and I thought, I can just look at the photos and videos, every now and then. Can’t I?Dr Scott Wark is a research associate at Warwick University who studies culture, technology and social media his PhD thesis was about memes. I called him to see if we are actually moving away from verbal communication. He was in Chile for work, and I couldn’t get through until I emailed to check he was there. But when we finally managed it, he was more optimistic than I had anticipated.He does believe that people are less willing to make calls. “It feels like more of an imposition. If I want to talk to my boss, we schedule a time to make a call. She doesn’t just call.” He points out that social media gives us far more control over a chat. “Even though there’s an idea that everyone’s addicted to social media and constantly checking updates, you can ignore a notification of a message. If I’m chatting to a friend in Australia, and I stop responding to her, I’ve probably just gone to sleep and I’ll pick it up the next day. It’s a continuous conversation that doesn’t interrupt anything and is parallel to whatever else we’re both doing.”Wark disputes the idea that we are becoming more disconnected he says it’s important to make a distinction between disconnection and distraction. If people are becoming more mindful about their phone usage, though, does he think calling might make a comeback?“What people are responding to, with the idea of a ‘digital detox’, is this overload of distractions. That is a huge problem, because there are all these demands on our cognitive capacity and that’s overwhelming, and exhausting. We’re spread thin.”It’s good to know we’re all at it. There is a running joke in my house that if the phone rings after 7pm, without a text to warn that a call is coming, one of us has to say, “Who’s dead now?” It’s not ha-ha funny, but it speaks volumes about what the once humble phone call has come to mean. I thought it was just us, that we’d developed gallows humour after a year of the kind of calls that drain the blood from the body, that in saying the worst out loud, it somehow would ward off more bad news.Wark said that he, too, thinks the worst if he has an unexpected missed call. When I talked to my friends about it, I realised that most people feel the same way. A phone call, out of the blue, is alarming. It’s a harbinger of doom, its ringtone a tiny scythe. The first thing I say when I answer the phone is usually, “What’s wrong?”On the first day of not texting for a month, a friend had some bad news about her health. I wanted to know how she was. But I thought calling would alarm her, because it has become alarming. So I texted, and we had a text chat, while the telly was on. Calling really would have felt like an imposition. I thought I’d call my girlfriend to see what she fancied for dinner, but she was on the tube, and the missed call made her worried that something had happened, so we ended up texting about that, too. My month of not texting was barely even a day old. I failed completely.I am wary of nostalgia. Nobody wants to hear another old person chirping that it was better in their day. When I spoke to Dr Wark, he sounded hopeful about the changing nature of communication. “I’m 31, and I’ve been chatting to people online since I was nine. Talking to people on text is totally naturalised,” he says. “Younger people are more willing to FaceTime one another now, and be watching TV, without really saying anything, just hanging out. There’s a different kind of presence involved.” There’s an argument that all this texting facilitates people meeting up in real life anyway, he says, and research to back that up. We may be more distracted than before, but we are more connected. I ask Wark if he’s a texter or a caller himself. It depends, he says, on the person, and his relationship to them. He calls his mum, he texts his partner. “But personally, I would prefer to meet my friends and just talk to them in a pub.”I could not stop texting, but in the search for a better connection, I did start to call more. I started to phone to cancel plans, and it proved a good litmus test: having to talk about it made me consider whether I genuinely wanted to cancel, or whether I was just being idle. I phoned a friend to say that, honestly, I couldn’t be bothered to travel for 45 minutes to see a film I wasn’t interested in and he said that, honestly, neither could he. We talked for half an hour. My girlfriend is often away for work and it’s become clear that talking on the phone once every couple of days is more substantial and infinitely nicer than constant texting about humdrum stuff.On the Failed Day of No Texts, it became horribly apparent just how compelled I was to share every little detail of what was happening to me. I dropped a plate, and went to tell someone about it, anyone. But to realise I might have to call someone to tell them I was clumsy, which they already knew, made it seem totally redundant. I felt free, somehow, from the obligation to transmit the boring bits of my life as rolling news. By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are almost always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face, they’re even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. It is much more difficult to be rude, and we could all use a bit of that.Talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned, scheduled, and to call is to really mean it. I still text, all the time. I feel inordinately proud of myself if my screen time drops below three hours a day. But I am calling more, too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two-sided and flexible and unpredictable. I just send a text to say I’m going to call first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abfe338bc8c05b21701e94c26a9153ff30df35c1/145_0_1693_1016/master/1693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e18f3697f0c349d12e31013bb776622a","title":"human hibernation the restoring effects of hiding away in winter","story":"How do you flourish through the darkest months of the year? Take a lesson from a sleepy dormouse…I sometimes think that winter doesn’t truly start until February. Once the final sunny moments of autumn have gone, I’m bounced along by preparations for the festive season. Even after the final New Year corks have popped, my own reforming zeal gets me through. I may not be tempted by dry Januaries, diets and punishing exercise regimes, but I’m always a sucker for a fresh start, for plans drawn up on new stationery and commitments made to improve myself.But by early February, I’m sagging. Tired, hungry and sick of the dark, my motivation has run out, my bank account is empty and the world feels soggy underfoot. I start to skip my yoga class and social invitations feel like an imposition. The urge to pull the duvet over my head becomes very strong indeed.Humans cannot actually hibernate, but in the coldest months of the year, many of us are drawn to something similar. We want to batten down the hatches against the treacherous weather outside, preserve our energies, lay on fat. If only we could suspend the demands of life, just until the sun comes out again, all would be well.Is it such a bad thing, this desire to hibernate until spring? After all, it feels like a natural response: winter simply demands that we slow down rather than drop out altogether – why can’t we find a way to do this?I recently visited hibernating dormice at Wildwood Trust just outside Canterbury. Dormice are one of only three UK mammals to hibernate (alongside hedgehogs and bats) and they do so for half of each year, retreating to their nests with the first frosts in October or November, and only emerging when food is abundant again in April or May. In late summer they gorge on fruit, storing the energy as easily accessible liquid fat just beneath the skin. As I learned when I held one – a perfect ball of amber fur rolling in my palm like a marble – you can leave fingerprints in a sleeping dormouse.To get through this long period without food, a dormouse will slow down its metabolism to the extent that it consumes almost no energy at all, waking briefly every 10 days to keep its organs in working order. We humans, having a few more worldly commitments and physical limitations than your average dormouse, are unable to do the same, but we can allow winter to modify the rhythms of our lives.Everything about me changes in winter – and I let it happen. Winter is a time to enjoy the pleasures of solitude, to dream and contemplate. It opens up a space in which I can mass my energies, to restore and repair. I want to eat cooked food instead of raw, comforting carbs over fresh flavours. I want to revisit beloved old films and spend time pottering in the company of the radio. Gone are the splashy novels of summer winter urges me towards thoughtful, ambulatory reading, chewed over in lamplight. In winter, I can spend hours in silent pursuit of a half-understood concept, or a detail of history. Winter has patience. There is nowhere else to be, after all.While summer often wakes me at 4am with dawn, in winter I can sleep for hours, surrendering to my bed shortly after 9pm, and drowsing there until my morning alarm. Our recent ancestors would have known this pattern well after all, electric light has only been with us for just over a century. Before that the winter nights were very long indeed.Sleepy as I am in winter, I find that I rarely slumber right through. Instead, I often wake in the middle of the night and spend an hour or two mulling over my thoughts, sometimes getting up to read, write or meditate, before returning to my bed to sleep until morning. I used to worry over these moments, considering them to be insomnia, but A Roger Ekirch’s book, At Day’s Close: a History of Nighttime, convinced me otherwise. Waking in the midst of a long winter night is, he argues, a form of sleep that would have been entirely normal before light was at our command. Nights were ided into a first and second sleep, with a “watch” in between, during which people would pray, reflect, make love or indulge in quiet conversation with family. It was an intimate time, so private and mundane that it barely merited a mention.A 1996 study by Thomas Wehr and colleagues suggests that we could fall back into this pattern given the right conditions. Wehr deprived his subjects of artificial light for 14 hours at a time in an attempt to replicate the prehistoric night. After several weeks, the participants fell into a routine of lying awake in bed for two hours before falling asleep for around four hours. They would then wake up and enjoy two or three hours of time that was characterised as contemplative and restful, and then take another four hours of sleep until morning. Most interesting of all, Wehr observed that the midnight watch was far from an anxious time for his subjects. They felt calm and reflective in these moments, and Wehr found that they had elevated levels of prolactin in their blood, a hormone more usually found in nursing mothers. It usually stimulates milk production, but in this context it seems to produce feelings of contentment and calmness. Wehr suggested that the watch was a unique state of consciousness with an “endocrinology all of its own”. Waking during this natural break in sleep seems to release a cocktail of hormones that isn’t found at any other point in our existence.Is this, then, our human version of hibernation: a thoughtful mode of being that’s profoundly restorative, brought about by the conditions of winter? Perhaps, but I prefer to see hibernation as a useful analogy rather than a biological imperative – after all, winter only comes to populations who live far from the equator wintering is not a universal human experience.We also need to understand the healthy limits of our urge to hide away in winter. In regions where solitude is forced upon communities through impenetrable weather, careful preparations are made to ensure that life remains stimulating and joyful during the dark months. Hygge may have been a lifestyle trend in the UK, but closer to the Arctic Circle, those cosy candles and comfort foods are tools of self-preservation. In Nordic countries, it’s common to stock the freezer with cakes and pastries over winter, ready to offer hospitality to anyone who comes to the door. The sauna is one of the ways that Finnish people battle against the cold. It is a place of refuge and a place that brings a sense of conviviality during periods of isolation. Chosen or not, our periods of hibernation need to be punctuated with moments of social contact, or else we unravel.I’ve learned to find my own way through winter though. I also seek moments of light and heat to keep my spirits high. In recent years, I’ve developed the (admittedly slightly eccentric) habit of retrieving discarded Christmas trees and squirrelling them in my back garden to light a series of spectacular, resinous bonfires on the darkest nights.I’ve learned to seek out some of the older winter festivals, too, which mark the beats of the season until the coming of spring. In January I attend one of Kent’s growing number of wassails, a half-pagan, half-Christian ceremony in which an apple tree is fed a tribute of cider to encourage a good harvest later in the year. And I pause on 1 February to mark Imbolc, the Gaelic festival that marks the start of spring, when the ewes are pregnant and the first snowdrops are appearing.Perhaps we can actually learn more from badgers and frogs than we can from dormice. Instead of hibernating, they fall into states of torpor for short periods of time when food is scarce. It seems to me that this is a model that works for our own winters, conserving our energies by avoiding the worst ravages of the cold rather than dropping out of life altogether.Wintering: How I Learned to Flourish When Life Became Frozen by Katherine May is published by Rider at £14.99.

Now increasing numbers of owners are being taken by their pets for a vigorous run instead.Although canicross – where a human is strapped with a bungee cord to a dog in a harness as it races across fields and woodland trails – has been slowly growing in popularity, there has been a huge jump in participation in the last 12 months. Demand across the UK for equipment has quadrupled, while for training classes it has nearly tripled. Record numbers are also signing up to running events that allow dogs.In response, a plethora of canicross training companies have sprung up, offering to teach joggers how to direct their dogs while running and ensure the pet’s pace is appropriate for its age and fitness level.At DogFit, around 4,000 people have taken part in training classes over the past year alone, which is 2,500 more than last year. “Participation is at record levels,” says co-founder Gail Walker. She estimates that over the same period sales of her canicross equipment kits have quadrupled. “At Christmas we were inundated,” she said.“It’s definitely been the busiest year for canicross equipment that we’ve seen,” says Adrian Ward, owner of Innerwolf, a website which sells canicross harnesses for dogs, waist belts for humans and leads made from bungee cords, to protect dog and owner from sudden changes in speed or direction.He has seen demand “at least double” over the past year, he says. “It’s exposure, I suppose. More people are hearing about it and, because most trail running events now incorporate a canicross category, there is more availability at races now as well.”Mark Tasker, a dog trainer at the Dog Academy in Hertfordshire, decided to start offering canicross taster classes last month after requests from his clients. “The first session was sold out and the next one is sold out too. Customers are looking for extra things to do with their dog,” he says.Canicross appeals because dog owners like the idea of getting fit while strengthening their bond with their pet, he adds. “Plus, if you run with your dog, you are learning a new skill, and actually, it’s easier than running on your own because you’re working as a team.”At Cani-Fit, another canicross training company, founder Lindsay Johnson says her clients and their dogs particularly enjoy the social aspect of the weekly hour-long training runs. “We get a lot of people who wouldn’t attend a gym or a running club. They use the dog as a crutch –they tell themselves they are doing it for the dog. As for the dogs, they love running with other dogs.”It’s a great way, she says, for nervous dogs in particular to safely socialise with other dogs. “When they all face the same direction, there doesn’t tend to be any intimidation.”Since it is best for dogs to run long distances on surfaces which are naturally bouncy and kind to their paws, canicross runs typically take place on trails, rather than pavements. “When you’re running the types of trails we do, you’re going on a real adventure,” says Johnson. “You’re running off-piste, through woods and streams, over fallen trees. It’s like going back to your childhood days, when you’re out playing in the woods, but you get to do it with your dog.”To run along such trails together, owners must work with their dogs. “You achieve a different level of understanding each other because you’re having to pick up on different senses, touch and positions. You get such a stronger bond, and such a sense of achievement with your dog,” she adds.One of the reasons canicross has become so popular so quickly is because it has a high retention rate, Walker says. “Once people go to a class, most people will continue with it.” She is particularly keen to stress the impact canicross has had on some of her runners with mental health issues. “They say it’s been really good for them because they’re running outside, they’re meeting people and they’re doing all that with their dog, their best friend. I’ve been told some lovely, heartwarming stories.”She will never forget the first time she tried canicross herself. “It was just exhilarating. You get a little pull from your dog, which you can control using commands, but it feels like you are running with dogs in a pack. They’re excited, they’re enjoying it, and you feed off them. It puts the fun back into serious running.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd618311527ada4ee0040fc2e3c9f14cc238f5f8/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd9fb0b5d468d70b72321df214febdff","title":"the return of toilet towels can we get over the yuck factor","story":"In a bid to save trees, money and space, some women are ditching TP and according to health practitioners, it’s not as unhygienic as it soundsLeisa Porter, a director at the Australian Department of Agriculture in Canberra, drives business transformation at work, but it’s curiosity and environmental engagement driving the transformation of her habits at home.“I’d made the switch to reusable net bags for fruit and veg, was taking my own containers for deli goods and using silicone to replace plastic wrap in the kitchen, but it had never occurred to me that I could reduce my toilet paper use,” she said.Her light bulb moment came the day she visited friend Samantha Hawker, an early adopter of what are – with varying levels of cringe – known as toilet towels, family cloths, wee wipes, and pee rags.The handmade blotters are cut from old cotton beach or bath towels and hemmed to avoid fraying. Used by women to dab dry after urination, they are approximately 10cm (4in) in diameter, about the size of an old-fashioned washcloth.The blotters are then collected in a receptacle before being laundered and sun-dried for re-use. Toilet paper, or a bidet, is still used for defecation.According to IBISWorld’s Industry Reports on Sanitary Paper Product Manufacturing in the US, total US expenditure in 2019 on toilet paper alone was about $US1.61bn. In the Australian market, IBISWorld reported 2018-2019 industry revenue from the “sanitary tissues” segment including facial tissues, toilet paper, napkins and serviettes, paper towels and antibacterial wipes of approximately $AUD990m.However, the IBISWorld report also forecast that during the five-year period to 2024, “competition from reusable, eco-friendly substitutes will increase as consumers become more environmentally conscious”.Porter is not surprised at this, given growing awareness that paper production and distribution require significant amounts of land, water, raw materials, energy, chemicals and fossil fuels. Following one year of use, the non-disposable wipes have reduced Porter’s toilet paper consumption dramatically, “and the bonuses are they don’t disintegrate when damp and they feel so much better on my body,” she said.“The blotters make sense on multiple levels including environmental, economic and comfort,” says gynecologist Alyssa Dweck co-author of the book The Complete A to Z for your V. “Sensitivity to toilet paper is a thing, especially if dyed, fragrant, rough or made from recycled paper that might have had ink exposure.”Penny Kothe, another blotting convert, lives with her husband in an old 6WD army ambulance, travelling Australia as regenerative farming volunteers. A former certified organic farmer with a bachelor of business degree, she estimates the toilet paper alternative saves one to two rolls of toilet paper per week. “Space is really tight when on the road and camping, so it means I don’t need to store so much. It’s so convenient too, I can easily keep a few cloths in my handbag and am never without something to use.”And what of people’s negative reactions? “My son actually helped me hem them, but some people say the use of energy and water to wash them negates the environmental impact,” says Kothe, “but I disagree as I just put them in with normal laundry loads. Hygienically, I don’t think it’s any different to when your son’s or partner’s jocks go in the same wash as other clothes, because, let’s face it, most males don’t use toilet paper for wees and can’t always avoid drips either.”Lauren F Streicher, MD, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University says there are no health risks from the practice. “People urinated long before toilet paper became available. There are zero health concerns with this … people have urine on their underwear all the time.”Dweck concurs. “Other than the general ‘yuck’ factor of having to store used blotters until laundry day, I don’t see any high risk for infection, especially if washed in hot, hot water and if you wash your hands after toileting. It’d be so convenient too if you are camping, hiking or land in the one stall that has an empty roll. I actually love the innovative spirit of this.”“I think everyone should try it out,” says Kothe, “and if it doesn’t suit, work out why and then work out how to adapt. One day, like some people experienced in the recent bushfires, you might run out or the supermarkets might be closed. We need to start being more resilient now.”Helping with that resilience are upskilling enterprises such as The Rhi Rebellion who have begun running workshops to spread the word and teach people how to make the cloths, as well as selling them to those who choose not to DIY.Back in Canberra, Porter’s experience has revealed that people are either interested or repulsed by the idea, “but I just say, ‘cut up an old towel and give it a go’.” Her tips for getting started include “an open wastepaper basket for used ones so you can let them air dry with zero smell before washing”. However, she warns “mark your clean and used baskets or keep them on different sides of the toilet so you don’t get confused”. Porter even encourages house guests to try. “It’s up to you if you leave fresh ones out for visitors to use, if you do, just hang some instructions on the wall - it’s a great way for others to learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1012b50cd5f5888fbeaa66e9ab3adc4b91e0ae/26_47_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac26a72fc93dd560c3c5dcd072e1a7f","title":"my life in oscars parties colin firth hadley freeman","story":"The 2020 Academy Awards will be my seventh. I’ve yet to win one but I’ve brought home some great storiesWhen you read this, I will be in Los Angeles, which is nice. I love LA, which is not a sentence you hear often, especially in Britain, where the city is often derided as too shallow, too full of celebrities and too hot, none of which are negatives in my book. The British antipathy to LA is rooted in a suspicion that anything that pleasant can’t be good for you, and an experience only counts if it involves endurance. I’ve spent the past 20 summers hacking it out at British festivals, trudging through mud with a rucksack the size of a car on my back, all in the name of Fun. So the first time I went to Coachella in California’s Palm Springs I thought I was hallucinating, like when Tintin gets so dehydrated he fantasises a sparkling oasis surrounded by palm trees, because that is what Coachella looks like. As I sat on the perfect green grass, eating my acai bowl, I remembered when Brits grumped that Glastonbury was getting gentrified because there were flushable toilets. Britain’s self-image is rooted in 1970s sitcoms, whereas California believes life should be like a Hollywood movie.And sometimes it actually is. I’m out here to cover the Oscars for, I think, the seventh time. I know this is deeply uncool to admit but, hot damn, I love the Oscars. Even as a kid one of my most beloved video cassettes was called Oscars Greatest Moments, but attending them has taken matters to a new level. I’ve yet to win an Oscar, but it is at the awards where I’ve lived out some of the great movie storylines. Behold, my Oscars Greatest Moments.What I hesitate to call my relationship with Harvey Weinstein can be charted by the Oscars we attended. In 2011, I was told by one of Weinstein’s 10 million assistants that I was banned from all Oscars parties and every restaurant in Beverly Hills, due to disparaging coverage of the The Weinstein Corporation in the ’s business pages. Once I’d stopped laughing, I courageously – like a marine, really – went to an Oscars party at Soho House, where Weinstein did, indeed, try to throw me out and I, marine-style, hid in the bathroom. As we now know, I was not the first woman to have to hide from Harvey in a bathroom. A few years later, Weinstein marked Oscars day by writing an article about me for this paper, complaining that I didn’t appreciate his Baftas party enough: “Next time Hadley Freeman comes to one of our parties she should relax, loosen up, have a glass of champagne and be sure to stay the whole night and really, truly… enjoy herself.” Not creepy at all, Harv! And here we are this year – or rather, here I am, because Weinstein is otherwise engaged. Such a shock this guy turned out to have a problem with women.The year: 2015. The person: Eddie Murphy. I spot Murphy on his own at an Oscars party and start hyperventilating over him with hero worship. He, alas, is less excited to meet me and walks away. Someone then taps me on the shoulder. “Hey, don’t worry I’ll take a selfie with you,” says the man, who I vaguely remember was hanging round with Murphy earlier. I graciously allow him to take a photo with me, and fly home the next day. “Some random member of Eddie Murphy’s entourage took a selfie with me,” I tell my boyfriend, showing him the photo.Turns out it was not a random member of Murphy’s entourage – it was Kevin Hart, AKA the biggest comedian on the planet. For the proper movie ending, Kevin and I should meet again at this Oscars and get married. You know where to find me, Kevin! (Lurking creepily around Eddie Murphy.)I went to the Vanity Fair party, where I spotted someone we’ll call dorky director (DD) with Weinstein (him again) and Matt Damon. As I knew DD a bit socially, I said hi, reminding him of my name. But DD decided I was not beneficial to his Hollywood cred, so he stuck his hand in my face and said, “No press.” Weinstein and Damon were now looking at me as Eddie Murphy would a few years later, and I was speechless with shock. But Colin Firth was nearby, overheard what happened and – despite clearly having never heard my name before – said, “Hadley Freeman? I’m such a fan! Can I talk to you?” Yes, this actually happened. DD looked like someone had punched him in the face. I was Lizzie Bennet at the end of Pride And Prejudice, Bridget Jones at the end of Bridget Jones’s Diary. Roll end credits!Exciting epilogue: in revenge for my Firth triumph, DD told friends of mine that he and I had had an affair in LA but I “couldn’t handle his freakiness”. Conclusion: men are dicks. Except for Colin Firth.So I’m excited about what movie plot will unfold around me tomorrow. Time travel, perhaps? Period drama? (Nah, sounds messy.) Fingers crossed for a body-swap storyline – maybe with Colin Firth. I know he’d be an excellent sport about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95cd9a223f1706b57fa3846d8064bc403f671199/0_58_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=744d02990983560324c5ca628d0e7f2a","title":"john sweeney interview the useful idiot","story":"The investigative journalist famed for high-volume encounters with ‘baddies’ of all shades was let go by the corporation. But he’s turned it into material for a novelThe Derek and Joy Sander College of Drama and Elocution has a lot to answer for. When he was 10 years old, John Sweeney’s family moved from Manchester down to Hampshire, and at his new school Sweeney was teased and bullied for his northern vowels. His worried mum sent him to elocution classes in Southampton to help him fit in. The drama college did not change his accent much – Sweeney was cast in plays as the flat-capped northerner – but it did an expert job in teaching him to project his voice.That voice has been a primary weapon in Sweeney’s one-man tour of duty as a reporter over 40 years, not so much speaking truth to power as, on occasion, yelling it. It was most notoriously employed against the official spokesman of the Church of Scientology in 2007 a clip of Sweeney (who apologised for “losing it” on assignment for the BBC’s Panorama) has been viewed several million times. It has also been consistently raised against tyrants and terrorists and gangsters (Sweeney, who retains a schoolboy sense of right and wrong, still likes to call them “baddies”). Its finest hour was when Sweeney spoke out, after a four-year investigation, about the evidence given by specialist witness Sir Roy Meadow in a series of cot-death trials. His stubborn work was crucial in helping to free three women falsely convicted for murdering their babies from Britain’s jails in 2003 and save several others from prison.I first heard Sweeney’s inimitable foghorn nearly 30 years ago in the Observer newsroom or, just as often, in the Coach and Horses pub next door, invariably telling stories of the places from which he had recently returned and just about lived to tell the tale. For a few of Sweeney’s dozen years at this paper, I was his editor, taking in copy from his surrealist road trips through civil wars in Algeria and Bosnia and Burundi, heartfelt gonzo stories which dramatised the troubles of the world with himself at centre stage.In Sweeney’s rumpled sitting room, bike in the doorway, books everywhere, photos on the walls cheerfully askew, we talk first about Gareth Jones, the hero of his novel, someone whose real-life story I’d never heard. Jones was the junior foreign correspondent of the Western Mail in the 1930s, born in Barry. Having been posted to Russia in his 20s, he became the first journalist to tell the story of mass starvation in Stalin’s regime, at a time when the rest of the world was hearing Soviet fake news. Sweeney’s dramatic reconstruction of these events does not aspire to great subtlety, but the story of Jones, a man after the author’s heart, is an enthralling one. (And the inspiration for a film released this week called Mr Jones, starring James Norton.)“For me, writing novels is like learning to be a brickie,” Sweeney says. “My first two thrillers were overcomplicated. But these historical thrillers (the first, Elephant Moon, was set in Burma during the second world war) I think I can do. I’m just finally doing that thing of writing exactly the books I would love to read.”The Useful Idiot was written partly as therapy during the extremely stressful months in which Sweeney came to the end of his 17-year career at the BBC. The final act of that long and often volatile association had been a well-publicised series of clashes with the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson.Sweeney had made an investigative film for Panorama about Robinson, exposing his links to far-right extremists in Germany. But the film – which went through 45 revised scripts – was never broadcast after Sweeney himself was secretly filmed, after far too many drinks, trying to persuade an associate of Robinson’s to speak to him on camera. Along the way in that video, circulated online, he was heard suggesting that “the BBC was a stupid and irritating organisation” and that he shared with Robinson heritage as an “Irish scumbag”.An online hate mob of Robinson supporters came after Sweeney and hundreds of them protested outside the BBC’s Salford offices about his proposed Panorama film. The corporation felt it had no choice but to publicly apologise for the remarks Sweeney had made, which had been “offensive and inappropriate”. He was put on gardening leave before an eventual parting of the ways. In a parting shot to Robinson, Sweeney took to Twitter to say: “… I can finally say these are not the views of the BBC, but he’s a complete c**t.”By his own admission, Sweeney had something of a breakdown during that period. His second marriage had not long ended and he had recently lost his mother. He wasn’t sleeping and was getting paranoid about the abuse. “I would wake up at three in the morning and all this stuff was going round in my head. I have been threatened lots of times. But in Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan, you have a helmet, a flak jacket, perhaps a security officer. Suddenly the dangerous place is just outside your own front door. I’m cycling around London and people are shouting: ‘Fuck off Sweeney! Tommy Robinson owns you!’”He went to see a psychiatrist about PTSD. The psychiatrist asked him if there were any events he had witnessed that might have triggered his anxiety. He started to tell him about a career that had taken in just about every conflict zone in the world. He talked about the genocidal Hutu and Tutsi killings in Burundi and was still describing things he had seen in Bosnia in the 1990s when the psychiatrist had to intervene to tell him that the session was nearly up. In the end he worked out a rest cure for himself. He and his ex-wife had bought an attic flat in Umbria a decade ago. “I fucked off to Italy and Italy cured me,” he laughs. “Though it is true that certain wine bar owners in Perugia’s old town, when they see me, their faces do light up.”Sweeney now lives just south of the river with his dog, Bertie. His two kids are in their 20s and 30s. In the months since he left the BBC he has begun the research for a podcast series investigating the killing of his friend Paul Jenks, the British photographer who was shot by a sniper while working in Osijek in Croatia in 1992. He has started on the next novel as well as a memoir and remains involved with campaigning for justice for the murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, about whom he co-wrote another book.I wonder where, looking back, he thinks he gets his restless sense of injustice from, his need to go after the baddies. In reply he talks first about his parents, whose photos are on the wall above where we are sitting. His dad left school at 14 to be an apprentice at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. In 1943 he was a third engineer in the merchant navy during the battle of the Atlantic. “He was a very funny man,” Sweeney says. “He used to do an impression in the pub of how it felt when a depth charge went off when you were in the engine room and the whole world shaking.”His mum was originally a scouser too. “They spent their whole lives either laughing or throwing verbal hand grenades at each other. Which was great. I think they both had a very big sense of social justice and fairness and honesty, and I liked that. For example, I would never, ever fiddle my expenses,” he laughs. “Though I’ll admit they have been substantial on occasion.”I remind Sweeney that one of his lasting legacies at the Observer has been a more parsimonious approach to spending. This dates back to 1992 when he was in a hotel bar in Dubrovnik and the city was under siege. The hotel was being shelled. Sweeney used his voice projection to address the bar: “We are all going to die, champagne is on the Observer.” Fortunately for the assembled hacks – but unfortunately for Sweeney’s expense account – the hotel was spared. Five months later, when the siege ended and the hotel reopened, he received a bill by post for £983.He set out as a teenager wanting to be a lawyer, but having gone along to trials could never imagine himself defending anyone he believed to be guilty. Journalism did not require that. He got his first break when doing shifts on the Sheffield . He’d gone away to visit a friend who was backpacking in India, and on the trip managed to talk his way into an interview with the Dalai Lama. He thought he better dress up like Sir Robin Day for the occasion. The interview began with the Dalai Lama asking Sweeney why he was wearing a bow tie but no socks. It made a centre spread. When he returned, a report of a local crime came in and the news editor sent up the immortal words: “There has been a murder in Barnsley, where’s the fookin’ Tibet correspondent?”His subsequent career is punctuated with comparable punchlines. Though apparently haphazard, he has an intuitive sense for the bigger picture. He was the first TV journalist, in 2013, to confront Donald Trump about links to the Russian mafia. No sooner was the name of convicted mobster Felix Sater – a former business partner of Trump’s – out of Sweeney’s mouth than Trump shook his hand and concluded their interview.Sweeney arrived in Yakutsk straight from a long and bibulous night at his niece’s wedding, hungover and jet-lagged. “My beard was quite full, and we reckoned I could pass quite easily as a professor of mammothology,” he recalls. He lined up with all the other museum curators, who had formed a guard of honour for the president. As Putin came up the steps, Sweeney greeted him with the words: “Tell me about the killings in Ukraine, Mr Putin.” Putin, startled, stopped to give his version of events. When Sweeney tried to ask a follow-up question, “a wall of Kremlin muscle closes around me and I am marched off down to the basement where I’m locked in”. He had no phone signal so was unable to contact his bosses at the BBC.He sees these notes as indicative of an organisation that – under siege from all sides – has lost its nerve. “You can’t be as neurotic as they are and cope with someone like me. It takes up too much time for them.”He used to have a joke with Mark Thompson, the former director general, who “whenever he saw me in the corridor he would make a point of literally running in the opposite direction”. Under Tony Hall, he suggests, that retreat was much more in earnest. People like Sweeney, the kind of troublemakers that the best newsrooms have always indulged, “became like the coronavirus”.He concedes that he probably did not advance his case by addressing director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, in emails as “Kim Fran-un”. His great problem, he says, the complaint of journalists the world over, is that “the management have generally never known what it feels like to try to get neo-Nazi thugs to talk or to be under fire in order to get a story. My fantasy has always been just to work for someone who has also done that stuff.”That was part of the substance of a recent letter to the TV regulator Ofcom that outlined his belief that there had been systemic editorial failures at the corporation, in particular in its handling of Brexit and Russia. He is awaiting a response. In the meantime, one or two of his run-ins with BBC management find their way verbatim into his novel and fit apparently seamlessly into an account of the Soviet secret police in the 1930s.His departure was a prelude to the coming round of BBC redundancies, which are no doubt likely to focus on the more expensive elements of news gathering – fewer filmed investigations, more talking heads. Before he left, like everyone else, Sweeney was doing vox pops about Brexit. He got it down to a fine art. “I would get off the train, head straight to the main square, find the guy on a mobility scooter with a Waffen SS sticker and get his views on taking back control. Then head over to Waitrose and find some professor on their day off to put the Remain argument. Then, on the way back to the station, a mother with her kids saying: ‘I just want them to get on with it.’ Forty-five minutes tops. I could do it. But it wasn’t anything to do with journalism.”There has been, in the best of Sweeney’s journalism, something far more dogged, that sense of being a proper pain to those with plenty to hide – and of looking for comedy as well as tragedy. He cites his TV heroes as Alan Whicker, Malcolm Muggeridge and celebrated Scot Fyfe Robertson. Before he left the BBC he at least fulfilled his ambition to do “a proper Fyfe Robinson intro”. He had been despatched to interview Ruth Davidson in January. The opening shot of his report was Loch Ness. Flat calm. And then suddenly, breaking the surface, Sweeney announcing: “All journalists worth their salt should avoid cliches like the plague. So where better than here, in Loch Ness, to start the hunt for that rare mystical beastie, the Scottish Conservative.”Sweeney is 61 now, but very far from any sense of retirement in many ways he feels like he is just getting going. “It’s like Rod Stewart has train sets, some people collect stamps,” he says. “I see my hobby as annoying the Church of Scientology, Kim Jong-un and the far right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3646ba391ff6b8b244e3a70aef3a78e3859a36/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e7123b968311a8ff8d0fbda18204341","title":"should i buy a manual petrol car or automatic hybrid","story":"My children are likely to learn to drive on it – and I’m wondering if the era of geared cars is overEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I’d like to buy a hybrid car but they’re nearly all automatics.

Some of Starmer’s supporters were said to be pushing his connection to the radical leftwing publication Socialist Alternatives, which he edited in his early 20s.Support from Corbyn’s north London stronghold cements Starmer as the clear frontrunner before a crucial week of the campaign. He has the support of more than twice the number of constituency Labour parties than Long-Bailey, his nearest rival.Tensions bubbled to the surface on Saturday at a hustings in Nottingham, when Emily Thornberry appeared to take a swipe at Long-Bailey’s disputed claims to have been up all night and fuelled by pizza as a result of the mass frontbench walkout designed to topple Corbyn in 2016. To gasps from the audience, Thornberry said: “I know some people had to be up late eating pizza but I did all these difficult jobs at the same time in support of the leader in the way he needed to be supported.”Long-Bailey responded to the jibe, saying: “Oh, miaow. We love each other really. I was working very, very hard, I’ll have everybody know. We did have to eat pizza.”Responding to the question that prompted the clash, which was whether it was acceptable for a Labour MP to attack a Labour council, she said: “In terms of attacking colleagues, we shouldn’t attack each other publicly under any circumstances.”Starmer pulled out of the hustings because his mother-in-law remains in a critical condition in hospital after an accident last month.The new Labour leader will be announced on 4 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a217e5e31429ee82ca175d168be657bc71caaa6/0_0_5416_3251/master/5416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf9b7b113f378000158833351abc9205","title":"cosmic ray research station mount aragats photo essay","story":"Cut off during winter, a former Soviet weapons research facility high up on Mount Aragats, Armenia is now part of a network of sites around the world studying the mysterious particlesThe cosmic ray research station on Mount Aragats sits at an altitude of 3,200 metres. The site in Armenia was constructed in 1943 to conduct top-secret research into atomic reactions for the development of nuclear weapons. Now the facility provides insight into thunderstorms and cosmic rays. The only way visitors can reach the base in winter is via a nine-mile (15km) climb through snow.Arshak Mkrtchyan, a mountain guide, cuts a trail to the station in snowshoes in temperatures around -22C.Arriving at the station at sunset, the wind is howling across the plateau and the temperature has plummeted to dangerous levels.Technicians at the facility work one month on, one month off during the winter.Inside the station, it is surprisingly cosy. Edik Arshakian and Gurgen Jabaryan, both technicians, are tasked with monitoring the scientific equipment, while Gohar Hovhannisian prepares the meals. She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.Hovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.The confusingly named “rays” are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.When they meet the Earth’s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed for corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.The particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.High-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.The Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.As well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes in radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.Soviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.Dotted around the centre, “scintillators” record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.Although Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.Jabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is “when the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month”. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: “We’re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there’s nothing to disturb them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has reached 563, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine and Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined outside Yokohama.China’s national health commission said that, as of midnight Wednesday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases throughout the country – a rise of 3,694 and the biggest 24-hour rise – as well as 24,702 suspected cases.Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.If you’ve been affected and would like to share your experience or news tips, anonymously if you prefer, direct with our journalists then please do so via the form below.

An admirable weekend from the rookie and a solid recovery from Heather Watson were ultimately insufficient, though, as Slovakia triumphed 3-1 defeat against Great Britain in the Fed Cup Qualifier in Bratislava. After Watson pulled one win back against Rebecca Sramkova, Dart lost the decisive rubber 7-5 6-3 to Anna Karolina Schmiedlova.The day started with a surprise as Slovakia’s No 1, Viktoria Kuzmova, was forced to withdraw from her match against Watson just an hour before play began. Although Dart was unable to secure victory in her debut Fed Cup singles rubber against the world No 65, she clearly left her mark. Kuzmova had arrived in the competition slightly under the weather and Dart’s two hours, 55 minutes of grit on Friday pushed the Slovak over the edge.Watson told the BBC she had been leisurely watching Netflix when she learned that her opponent had changed and she scrambled for some last-minute scouting. From being billed as the underdog against a natural clay-court player, Watson was suddenly heavily favoured against an inferior rival.It is the type of pressure she loves and instead of feeling forced outside of her comfort zone as she did against Schmiedlova on Friday, the roles were reversed and Watson had endless time to patiently control the points against a player whose ground strokes struggled to pierce the court.Nine years after making her Fed Cup debut, Watson now proudly boasts a record of 21-10, which places her joint second on the all-time list for Fed Cup singles wins by British women, behind only Virginia Wade. There have been plenty of tough losses against superior opponents, but throughout her Fed Cup career, Watson has expertly torn through the matches she is supposed to win. She is extremely reliable and she will always bring a certain level of quality to each match. In the majority of her contests, it is usually enough.Watson’s victory set the stage for a must-win match for Dart in order to keep the tie alive. Although Dart’s ranking of 140 puts her above the No 199, there was no delusion in the British camp about the quality of the tie’s MVP, Anna Karolina Schmiedlova, who is returning from knee surgery and had previously risen as high as No 26. While Dart was able to rely on her defence and scrappily dig out as many errors as possible from, Schmiedlova is a quick, consistent player who intelligently navigates the clay. Dart would have to be considerably more aggressive.The importance of the encounter was reflected in how proactive both players were as they constantly prodded each other’s defences, desperate to find a way through. Dart sent laser-like beloved backhands down the line and she constantly exposed Schmiedlova’s court positioning with sweet, delicate drop shots The points were grueling and entertaining but in the end the Slovak’s superior savvy on the clay court drove her through as she broke Dart at 6-5 to steal the first set. In the second set, Schmiedlova battled through numerous tight service games, but she constantly kept her head above water and secured the win.In the end, despite Johanna Konta’s absence looming throughout, a different surface may have yielded a great result. The surface proved the defining difference of the tie, with the Slovaks demonstrating their expertise as they outmanoeuvred Great Britain to victory.As Slovakia head to Budapest for the Fed Cup finals alongside Switzerland, Germany, France and Australia, Great Britain will have to defend their spot in the top level of the competition at the Fed Cup play-offs in April. A loss in April and relegation to the Fed Cup zonal groups just one year after finally escaping them would be a considerably more traumatic result.In other Fed Cup qualifiers, Serena Williams made a happy return in her first Fed Cup singles match in five years, extending her unbeaten singles record to 14-0 by soaring under pressure in both tie-breaks as she beat Jelena Ostapenko 7-6 (4) 7-6 (3).

They will travel to Twickenham in a fortnight, where Farrell will send out his boys in search of the prize against his homeland, his former employers – against his son. The narrative is delicious.In the end, Storm Ciara did the right thing, holding off for just long enough to allow the home team to whip up enough turbulence themselves. In so doing, they saw off a Wales team embarking on new journeys of their own. Ciara’s stiffening winds could only assail the high south walls of the Aviva. There was evidence, certainly, of some capricious eddies in the stadium, but the integrity of the contest was preserved.If a new coach wants improvement with each match, Farrell can have no complaints: this was a notable step up from last week’s win over Scotland. The dark days of the end of Joe Schmidt’s reign are already starting to feel well in the past. Ireland did not have it all their own way. An absorbing match reached its pitch either side of the hour, as Wales, trailing 19-7, pushed hard for the try that not only would have been well deserved but might have propelled the match into the next level of drama.Hadleigh Parkes, who was but one of several to shine as Wales wound up the intensity in attack, picked a fine line, broke the tackle of Peter O’Mahony and reached out for the line. Everyone seemed happy with a good try, but closer inspection revealed the ball to have slipped from his grasp just as he placed it. A few minutes later, a euphorically celebrated penalty at an attacking Welsh scrum allowed Ireland to clear their lines. Storm weathered. The rest of the match was theirs.A sprinkling of luck, then, but Ireland capitalised on it, closing out the game with authority. The two late tries, one apiece, were decoration by then – no less, though, than the match deserved.There was an urgency about both teams from the off, as if they knew they had to work fast before the storm came. Ireland’s first game under Farrell could be rated no more than satisfactory, but here they immediately found some joy on the wide outside. Jacob Stockdale and his mates made hay down Wales’s outside-centre channel, where Nick Tompkins, after his dazzling debut as replacement in last week’s romp against Italy, was introduced to the discomforts of life on the international stage. His most glaring error was to allow Jordan Larmour to step inside him on the way to the game’s first try, but if we can measure a player’s comfort by the number of times the opposition pour through his channel, the storm seemed to start early for Saracens’ latest international. Whether it was entirely his fault will be picked apart by the analysts later.Wales spent the first quarter of the match under the cosh as Ireland came and came in the finest of traditions. Not that the visitors were unduly perturbed. They forced turnover after turnover in that period, practically Irish in the alacrity with which they sacked Ireland’s rucks and mauls.Life under Wayne Pivac feels more invigorating already. After two rounds, Wales have already scored nearly as many tries as they managed all campaign last season. Few needed reminding in Dublin, in the bars, buses and hotels, that that campaign yielded Wales a grand slam. The gist of the retorts, equally pointed, was that it was just about the least convincing grand slam of modern times, 10 tries from five matches, the same as winless Italy. This term they have seven from two. It might have been eight, but for Parkes’s careless fingertips.Wales’s use of big, ugly forwards as pivots was adroitly worked and very of the time. Their response to Larmour’s try was to seize their first meaningful stretch of possession, which culminated in a beauty of a try by Tomos Williams, sparked by a wall pass from old Alun Wyn Jones.Brilliant – but it is almost more important how a team respond to their own brilliance than how they respond to the opposition’s. Williams’s next act was to fumble a lineout, which paved the way for Ireland’s second.It was the sort of error that probably would not have happened in Cardiff. Conversely, Farrell’s regime has been eased into its rhythms by the luxury of two home matches on consecutive weekends. Now his mission increases in its intensity, a trip to Twickenham for an early tilt at some tangible reward. He could not have hoped for a more poignant development to that narrative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43d8936f33ec64c5996f7aa044df723cbc55fcb/0_315_4659_2795/master/4659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=201141604e0f4c255f4687716669c962","title":"south africa england third odi live","story":"36th over: South Africa 161-5 (Miller 10, Phehlukwayo 1) Moeen keeps going and after a single apiece, Miller rams a sweep that drops just shy of the rope, earning a much0needed four. From here, six an over gets 247, eight an over 271. Any less than that second total and England should breeze it. Oh dear oh dear! Smuts turns to midwicket and Baton es to stop, but the batsmen have already gambled on him missing! So when the ball goes keeper’s end, Smuts is stranded and that’s a ridiculous error at a crucial moment. 35th over: South Africa 155-4 (Smuts 31, Miller 5) The last thing South Africa will want to see now is Chris Jordan back into the attack, but here’s CJ after Smuts takes a single to cover, he forces one through Miller’s gate, narrowly missing the stumps, before another single brings Smuts back onto strike. 34th over: South Africa 153-4 (Smuts 30, Miller 4) Another tidy over from Moeen, two singles from it. It’s hard to see where the big overs are coming from, given how well Curran and Mahmood bowled first up. Drinks. 33rd over: South Africa 151-4 (Smuts 29, Miller 3) A much-needed decent over for South Africa, Smuts taking two over mid on then a single into the off side, before Miller takes one to mid on allowing his partner to slice hard past slip to the fence. “Yes, that phone ringing scene is indeed the best one in world cinema history” begins Rob Lewis, “because I was in it. I was standing behind de Niro and you can just about catch a glimpse of half of my face. Was living in Montreal at the time and called up to be in the Jewish scenes in the movie. But they were short of bystanders, so off came the long beard and locks, and voila, I was a 1920s dude in a hat. Sergio Leone himself adjusted my hat.I went to see the film with a dozen mates, and the scene comes about five minutes in. Nobody saw me. For the rest of the three hours, all the dozen kept stage whispering, and asking me when I’d appear......”Amazing, that has got to be the greatest call-up of all-time. Ya’amod!32nd over: South Africa 143-4 (Smuts 22, Miller 2) Moeen rustles through another tight over, two from it his last ball is a nut, beating Miller who goes back, but missing the stumps by a nasal hair. 31st over: South Africa 141-4 (Smuts 21, Miller 1) Miller plays away three dots before taking a red buller to midwicket Roy shies and misses ... just. “As noted by a  reader recently, the Pythons didn’t do the Four Yorkshiremen sketch, except as an occasional live performance,” says John Starbuck. “It was in 1969, Do Not Adjust Your Set. Trying to recall older films for best openings too. The Wizard of Oz, Rebecca, the Italian Job, the Pink Panther, Zulu, and several Bond films could all be contenders, chiefly for the ability to establish a tone at the outset. Psycho was the opposite, deliberately, so you also have to think about films with an early twist.”The Wizard of Oz is one of my favourites, though the last time I watched it I wondered if it wasn’t the change into glorious technicolour, rather than the set-up that I loved. There’s a new version of Rebecca coming, directed by Ben Wheatley, which should be brilliant. Three for Rashid, but what was Quinton quontempltying! He has an enormous hoik at a straight one that spins in, misses by a fortnight, and South africa are in all sorts! 30th over: South Africa 139-3 (De Kock 69, Smuts 20) Smuts takes one to mid off and Jordan hits with a shy ... but he was in, just. Then De Kock flicks to midwicket and Curran is there on the fence ... only to field fresh air! The crowd love that and rightly so who doesn’t love a misfield. Sensational. Curran shakes his head, doubtless pondering Adam Smith’s invisible hand theory. 29th over: South Africa 134-3 (De Kock 65, Smuts 19) South Africa are starting to move, Smuts chasing Rashid outside off to zetz him for six over cow corner. A single follows, then De Kock bangs back over the bowler’s head and they run two two more singles follow.“The ODI playing conditions allow for a failure of DRS technology, but read the small print here (section 3.6.8 of Appendix D),” emails Romeo.“‘A Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ may be reinstated by the ICC Match Referee at hisher sole discretion (if appropriate after consultation with the ICC Technical Official andor the television broadcast director) if the Player Review could not properly be concluded due to a failure of the technology. Any such decision shall be final and shall be taken as soon as possible, being communicated to both teams once all the relevant facts have been ascertained by the ICC Match Referee. A Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ shall not be reinstated if, despite any technical failures, the correct decision could still have been made using the other available technology. Similarly, a Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ shall not be reinstated where the technology worked as intended, but the evidence gleaned from its use was inconclusive.’ You could see the gap between bat and ball.”Can’t argue with that. 28th over: South Africa 123-3 (De Kock 62, Smuts 11) De Kock has a massive heave at Moeen and Jordan looks like he’s underneath it, but bails at the last second after deciding he can’t quite get there so should save the boundary. For more singles from the other. 27th over: South Africa 119-3 (De Kock 60, Smuts 9) Shaun Pollock reckons South Africa shouldn’t have got that review back on the basis that Bavuma definitely didn’t edge. I guess the umpire could use discretion in such circumstances, but also understand the need for a standardised approach: if the tech fails, you get another go. Four singles off Rashid’s over.“This is a great way to follow cricket while worrying about my fences and tiles surviving these Oxfordshire winds,” says Gerry Flynn. “Re beginnings of films, Inglourious Basterds is pretty good. Harrowing, but brilliantly written and acted.”Agreed. I wouldn’t say the first half-hour, but that first scene is an absolute masterclass in sustaining drama. 26th over: South Africa 115-3 (De Kock 58, Smuts 7) After De Kock takes two to point, Moeen drags one down and he doesn’t miss out, using the crease to move backwards and get underneath it, monstering six over midwicket. 25th over: South Africa 107-3 (De Kock 50, Smuts 7) De Kock gets to his 50 with a single, one of three and a bye from the over. South Africa will be happy with 270 here. “I totally agree about ‘Once ...Hollywood’, boring and self-indulgent in its references,” says David Gaskell, presumably not the former Manchester United goalie. “As for Brad Pitt as supporting actor, he was no different from every role he ever plays. I think he knows this by a double bluff he employs of self-deprecation about his role. Best intro for me is Gladiator. How refreshing to have a cricket commentator who is a cineaste at the same time. Neville Cardus would be delighted, especially with the Python Yorkshireman discussion of Fiery Fred. These cricketers today don’t know they are born. Brian Statham had to get up early, tailor a pair of flannels, knit a pullover and make the potted meat sandwiches for Old Trafford.”I thought Brad Pitt was still one of the better things about Once Upon A time, which isn’t saying much. He does though, suffer from OBOer’s curse – also known as being distractingly handsome. 24th over: South Africa 103-3 (De Kock 48, Smuts 6) The Wanderers might have the best track in cricket now, offering something for everyone, though I also like Old Trafford. Four singles off this Moeen over, and predictions of a 320 total – rife pre-match, with good reason – look extremely hopeful now. 23rd over: South Africa 99-3 (De Kock 46, Smuts 4) Suddenly De Kock needs to play the anchor, which is not why he’s out there. He needs the lads at the other end to do that, so he can blaze away. But here’s Smuts, getting off the mark by sweeping Rashid to the square leg fence. “I don’t know about half an hour but Rushmore gets my vote for ‘most amusing opening montage’” says Brian Withington. “In passing, I wish I was as technically flawed as Jonny Bairstow, but I take your point.”Well yes, but I also wish I was as technically flawed as Devon Malcolm. 22nd over: South Africa 94-3 (De Kock 45, Smuts 0) Phew! What a ludicrous passage of play that was you love to see it. Review that! Moeen pushes one through a bit quicker, diddling Van der Dussen in the flight, and hilarious as it would’ve been for him to go on and score 502*, a hint of turn through the gate sends him on his way. Suddenly England are right back on top, and its the spinners who’ve done it well done Eoin Morgan. 21st over: South Africa 90-2 (De Kock 45, Van der Dussen 1) Ultra-edge wasn’t working, apparently,  so South Africa retained their review. Fair enough, I guess. That is extremely fortunate that first one was out out out. Er yes, but no one knows why there was a review when South Africa just wasted theirs. The umpire seems to have decided to take another look I hope they don’t go back to the World Cup final. You what?! The umpire has decided to review, but no one knows why!The wicket-taker is on a hatty! He’s bowling so straight, and this one spins back in – I’m not sure the batsman picked that – and Van der Dussen has to go! That might’ve missed leg stump, but there’s no review! That was not a good review at all, though I’d blame De Kock rather than Bavuma. The ball was hitting, but what’s this?! Bavuma has been called back as Aleem Dar thinks there may have been a hint of bat! The ball hit Bairstow in the chest, but I’m not sure where it was going pre-pad, other than into the pegs. The wicket-taker does it again! Bavuma gets a big stride in, but a big stride in for him, and his bat, well away from his body, invites the ball to snake into his pad! Up goes the finger!21st over: South Africa 89-1 (De Kock 45, Bavuma 29) De Kock takes a single and Bavuma plays all around one, which hits the pad they appeal but nothing doing and no review. 20th over: South Africa 88-1 (De Kock 44, Bavuma 29) “Top-edge central lads,” says Bairstow as Bavuma misses a mow I think the 29 goes there after Techniquegone West. And yes, the 29 is the greatest London bus, thank you for playing Wood Green, Green Lanes for kebabs, Finsbury Park, Holloway Road, Camden, Goodge Street, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square. 19th over: South Africa 85-1 (De Kock 42, Bavuma 28) It’s nice to see Rashid back too, playing his hundredth ODI, and England could use his wicket-taking capacity. De Kock takes his first delivery for a single, then Bavuma cuts Root flings out a hand and though it’s ultimately a drop, he in fact does really well to slow the ball down enough so that Moeen can do really well to slide on the fence, saving one as they run three. Meanwhile, in Pochefstroom, India are 57-1 off 17, playing Bangladesh in the men’s world under-19 final. 18th over: South Africa 80-1 (De Kock 40, Bavuma 25) Moeen repaces Root – it’s really great to see him back. A quiet over cedes four singles. “I feel moved to point out, as a fact rather than an opinion,” opines Geoff Wignall, “that the best opening to an English-language film is that of Once Upon A Time In The West .” That is good, which also reminds me of the phone ringing in Once Upon A Time In America”. There’s a lot once upon a timing going on here, which reminds me how dull, joyless and self-indulgent I found its latest iteration, which I hope wins nothing tonight. Conversely, i hope that Parasite wins everything. 17th over: South Africa 76-1 (De Kock 38, Bavuma 23) You know when it’s well cold, a penny floater hits you on the thigh, and you experience the most severe pain known to mankind? Well Bavuma knocks one to mid on and Curran throws at the stumps, whacking him a right sair yin just below the hip. He’s lucky cricket’s played with a corky. Ceej then offers a wide and four dots before De Kock punishes the error, flicking – yes, flicking – the extra delivery over midwicket and into the crowd. That’s drinks, and he looks set. 16th over: South Africa 68-1 (De Kock 32, Bavuma 22) I thought Root’s last over would be the end of his spell but Morgan tries to finagle one more and it doesn’t work out. After a single to each batsman, De Kock waits for him and plays a cut so late it’s almost extinct – a dodo cut – for four, before another single apiece. England need a wicket.

Relive your childhood on its arcade and pinball machines, tackle giant Jenga, or take on some locals at table tennis.Eat and drinkFor a reasonably priced meal in a striking venue, visit Kafé Magasinet (Tredje Långgatan 9) in the neighbourhood’s former auction house. Sourdough pizzas are the speciality and a cosy, plant-filled terrace with a glass roof means you can feel as though you’re outdoors without being at the mercy of Gothenburg’s changeable weather.Next door, Tacos \u0026amp Tequila (Tredje Långgatan 9) is a hugely popular lunch and dinner spot, known particularly for its blackened salmon ceviche. Queuing for a table may be necessary but the no-reservations policy is a blessing: Swedes book tables weeks in advance if they’re given the chance.The Gothenburg beer scene has exploded in the past decade, so find out what all the fuss is about by rounding off the day at Soho Beer House (Andra Långgatan 5). This cosy but lively bar has a vast selection from the city’s micro-breweries and knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you pick. Dugges, a brewery at the vanguard of Gothenburg’s craft beer surge, is a must for beer fans.Where to stayYou won’t find a hotel in Långgatorna and that’s good: it keeps the authentic, local feeling alive, but a 20-minute walk or 10-minute tram journey links the neighbourhood with Gothenburg city centre. There, Avalon Hotel (doubles from £86 B\u0026ampB) vaunts its feng shui certification, and has stylish rooms plus a rooftop pool with a great view. Lee RodenThis part of Brussels, on the public transport network but pretty much off the tourist trail, has as many elderly residents as young professionals looking for bars and boutiques. You’re as likely to find yourself talking to a new arrival from Africa, opening his dream restaurant, as to a septuagenarian Belgian bar owner. In recent years, the student population – the city’s main French and Flemish universities are here – has attracted emerging talent and new investment. Until the end of 2020, the red-brick former army barracks immediately north of the Etterbeek train, tram and bus stops is home to the See U project full of sustainable small businesses, including Brussels’ first pushchair-friendly cafe, a cinema, a velodrome and a weekly organic market.See and doThe area is a paradise for entrepreneurs. Wine, spirits and cigar shop Boire et Fumer (Drink and Smoke) has been at 38 Avenue de l’Université for 57 years. Since 2005, it has been run by local Philippe Degand. At 62 rue des Hellènes, surveyor Jean-Baptiste Jonné retrained as a chocolate maker to open his first shop, L’Alchimie du Chocolat, in 2001. Ariane Noël, the manager of independent clothing boutique Cheep (110 Avenue des Saisons), says her clients range from young students to women in their 90s. Another female entrepreneur, Rachida Bouganzir, oversees the Haricot Magique cafe at See U, with a large indoor and outdoor site for parents and small children. After shopping and coffee, head to the Cimitière d’Ixelles to admire art nouveau tombstones at a site calling itself the Père Lachaise of Ixelles.Eat and drinkPlace de la Petite Suisse is the place to go for quality Asian food, with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants jostling for space. Bar Le Montmartre on the same square has been an institution for students, academics and couples looking for a quiet pastis or evening of live music since the 1960s, though beer fans also like Tavernier (445 Chaussée de Boondael). The pricey Caves d’Alex restaurant (14 rue Eugène Cattoir) moved last year from near the European Parliament to a spectacular former wine cellar. La Verveine (375 Avenue de la Couronne) serves French-Moroccan fusion food in a relaxed setting. Across the road at no 570 is Café Ricardo’s, serving excellent Portuguese food to a mostly Portuguese clientele.For sinfully good pastries, gluten-free bakery Chambelland opened its first branch outside Paris at 42 Avenue de l’Universite in 2018, while artisanal boulangerie La Fleur du Pain has just opened a new branch at 449 Chaussée de Boondael this year.Where to stayThe lack of tourists means there are no hotels in the quarter, but a short ride away on the number 8 tram is Avenue Louise and the Pantone Hotel (doubles from €59 room-only) where rooms are allocated based on the guest’s “mood and preferred colour”.Emily WaterfieldWhile the rest of Valencia was being treated to a Bilbaoesque makeover in the early 2000s, the rightwing city council of the time had it in for the fishing quarter of El Cabanyal, 5km east of the centre. It wanted to drive a swanky new avenue through the quaint streets, demolishing 1,600 houses, many of them decorated with original art nouveau tiles. It was classified a “listed area of cultural importance”, but the district was nonetheless threatened with compulsory purchase orders and destruction, until protests by local campaigners finally saw the scheme blocked by the courts. Over the past few years, El Cabanyal has been on the up, but this authentic slice of the city remains undiscovered by most tourists. While there’s a newly cosmopolitan vibe, the quarter’s traditional personality is being cherished by incomers, and the new shops and bars springing up everywhere tend to respect and adapt the vernacular architecture, rather than replace it. It’s a doddle to get here on the metro and, because it’s pancake-flat, it’s enjoyable to explore by bike. Hire one at Santamarcelita (Calle de la Reina 11) for €10 a day, or join a guided cycle tour with Poblados de la Mar (€25pp, in English on Mondays and Fridays at 10am), starting at bike shop Todobici on Calle Serrería.See and doFrom Las Arenas beach turn up Calle Mediterraneo, following the tram tracks – but keep an ear open as they move silently. Because of El Cabanyal’s grid layout, it’s difficult to get lost. The area is home to two excellent and under-visited museums: Museo Semana Santa Marinera (Calle del Rosari 1, closed Mon, free Sun), explains the rituals of Easter week and Museo del Arroz (Rosari 3, €2, closed Mon, free Sun), housed in an old rice mill, has the lowdown on the main ingredient of classic paella.Not all the tiled houses are in good repair – and all are private, so admire from the outside only. Examples to seek out are Calle Lluch 219 (the upper storey), Calle Progreso 262 and Calle Mediterraneo 37, which has a tiled mosaic showing oxen hauling a fishing boat out of the water at the top of its facade.El Drac del Cabanyal (Calle de la Reina 191B) sells traditional tiles and other handicrafts and, on the next street, Hilos, Cuerdas y Redes (Calle Lluch 159) is a traditional shop selling nautical rope and other boating accessories. Bookshop-cum-bar La Batisfera (Calle de la Reina 167) is a beautiful place to browse Spanish and English books, and the bar has good vegetarian options.Mercado del Cabanyal (every day except Sunday) is a mini-version of Valencia’s central market, selling local specialities such as horchata (a milk drink made from tiger nuts), while the Thursday Mercadillo street market on Calle Vilar sells mainly clothes and homewares.Eat and drinkThere are plenty of traditional spots in El Cabanyal: Casa Montaña (CJose Benillure 69) is a classic bar that has been going since 1836, where specialities include anchovies and mussels in various ways, but do try the baby broad beans sautéed with Iberian ham. The wine selection covers pretty much all of Spain. For authentic fishy cuisine (such as savoury cake made with squid ink and locally cultivated oysters) head to Taska Lareina (CReina 173) in a basement behind one of the Cabanyal’s best facades.For a straightforward, cheap meal try Bodega Bar Flor (CMarti Grajales 21) next to the market, which has been serving the locals since 1893 (rice dishes predominate: you can’t go wrong with paella but, for something different, try arròs amb fesol i naps – rice with white beans and turnip). Ca Tere (CReina 61), in another modernist building, also specialises in rice, but without so much choice.The best place for breakfast is Horno San Vicente (Progreso 148) which sells fresh ensaïmadas, soft coiled buns made with lard and dusted with sugar. The best horchata is from ice-cream specialist La Jijonenca (CPadre Luis Navarro 307, and Paseo Neptuno 26). For snacks, La Pascuala (CLluch 299) serves prodigiously large bocadillos.The hippest place for a drink is La Fabrica de Hielo, a huge bar in a former ice factory, one road back from the beach (CJose Ballaster Gonzalvo 37). It has a busy programme of live music and arts events and tapas supplied by a food caravan.Where to stayOn a palm-lined street in the middle of the district, Apartamentos Barracart (from €100 a night) has seven bright, large-windowed apartments. Hotel Neptuno (doubles from €75 B\u0026ampB) is a spacious option right on the beach. Further south, near the port, Balcon al Mar (doubles from €55 room-only) is a pleasant, inexpensive place, with bikes for guests to use. Nick Inman With city-centre rents skyrocketing, this once-bourgeois enclave is fast finding favour with a young, creative crowd. It is only a 20-minute walk from downtown and handy for primary exit routes: Porto’s main bus terminal and train station are on the doorstep and there’s a metro line to the airport.See and doThere are no malls in Bonfim, but plenty of cool independent stores, mostly on Rua de Santo Ildefonso. Keep an eye out for bookshop Inc. (no 25), a recent outpost of lifestyle outlet Patch (no 95), and the intimate emporium of cheeses and preserves that is Queijaria Amaral (no 190).Being home to Porto university’s fine arts faculty means Bonfim has always had an active arts scene. For contemporary art, the Senhora Presidenta (Joaquim António de Aguiar 65) and Lehmann + Silva (Duque da Terceira 179) galleries never disappoint. For fans of documentary photography, the recently launched Salut au Monde! (Santos Pousada, 620) is a must.For superb views over the Douro, stroll around the Parque de Nova Sintra (R. do Barão de Nova Sintra). Once private, this small leafy park is now owned by the water authority and has a wonderful collection of old fountains.Eat and drinkOne of the joys of Bonfim’s relative seclusion from Porto’s tourist boom is the plethora of old-school places to eat. For a classic neighbourhood dinner, try Madureira’s (Rodrigues de Freitas 1) for grilled tiger prawns or a francesinha (doorstep meaty sandwich). Local favourite Casa Aleixo (Estação 216) does a mean octopus with rice. Pulled-pork sandwiches at Casa Guedes (Praça dos Poveiros 130) are another local staple.Alongside these is a string of exceptional new eateries. Top of the list is Pedro Limão, on Bonfim’s western side, run by an architect-turned-chef serving fine dining at fair prices (10 courses €49) it recently added studio rooms upstairs. If meat-free is your bag, back towards the centre Árvore do Mundo (Duque de Loulé 228) and Manna (R. da Conceição 60) serve splendid veganveggie fare (Manna also does yoga classes).As for cafés and bars, there’s one on nearly every corner. Hip hangouts include speciality coffeehouse Combi (Morgado de Mateus 29) and brunch-lunch-coffee bar Bird of Passage (Duque de Loulé 185). For great cocktails (and pizza), head to TerraPlana (Av. Rodrigues de Freitas 287).Where to stayBonfim’s charm owes much to its elegant, early-20th-century townhouses. None is classier than myhomeinporto (from €200 for 2 nights), a boutique guesthouse run by former interior designer Juan de Mayoralgo. Similarly stylish is the 10-room, French-inspired Cocorico guesthouse (doubles from €90 room-only).Oliver BalchEven a decade or so ago, Neukölln, in south-east Berlin, was something of a backwater – a no-man’s-land beyond the trendy centre. Then the district’s cheap rents and gritty vibe were discovered by the international creatives and students, who moved in among the Turks, Kurds and Arabs to create today’s multikulti ambiance. Shack-like kebab shops and smart restaurants, shisha cafes and shabby-chic e bars, underground art galleries and commercial casinos sit side by side, and there is always something new to discover.Head to the main drag, Sonnennallee, for tasty, cheap Palestinian and Lebanese food stroll south-west to villagey Rixdorf, passing stone churches, cobbled streets and lovely Comenius botanical garden for late-night drinks, try hip Weserstrasse and for indulgent brunches and vintage browsing it’s hard to beat the area that overlaps with Kreuzberg (Kreuzkölln). The coolest area is probably dynamic, fast-changing Schillerkiez, next to Tempelhof park, site of the former city airport and Berlin airlift, which is now a vast recreation area where it’s possible to land-surf, cycle and rollerblade down the former runway.See and doGiven the creative influx and affordable rents, it’s no surprise to find a wealth of galleries and cultural spaces in the neighbourhood. These tend to be small and experimental like Loophole (Boddinstrasse 60), a club and music venue in a former brothel that also does site-specific works. The larger Kindl Centre for Contemporary Art (€5, under-18s free, Am Sudhaus 3) is in a former brewery and has installations and live performances.The district is well known for its vintage shopping and for stores that double as cafes. Sing Blackbird (Sanderstrasse 11) has shoes, jewellery and secondhand clothes, as well as juices, vegan pancakes and bagels. Rag and Bone Man (Briesestrasse 9) focuses on home decor and flowers, tipping into therapeutic services such as counselling. Shio (Weichselstrasse 59) works with local designers and stocks pretty and ethically minded papercraft, jewellery, clothes and home design objects. For food, the Turkish market by the Landwehr canal on Maybachufer has a great range of fresh produce and textiles every Tuesday and Friday.Eat and drinkFor something cheap, cheerful and filling, hole-in-the-wall Berlin Burger International (Pannierstrasse 5) has specialities such as the Godmother, with mozzarella and serrano ham, plus killer sweet potato wedges. Vietnamese joint Hamy (Hasenheide 10) also offers delicious daily lunch specials for just €5, while vegans will enjoy Two Planets (Hermannstrasse 230), whose offerings include a famous sourdough bread with avocado, delicious cakes and great salads. Swisher options include Lavanderia Vecchia (Flughafenstrasse 46), which serves rustic trattoria food in a former launderette, and chic new dessert restaurant Coda (Friedelstrasse 47), which has won a Michelin star for its innovative menu of savoury, as well as sweet, concoctions. The full set menu costs €138 a head but come after dinner and sit at the bar for a cocktail and à la carte option.For post-dinner drinks, there are a dozen great bars on Weserstrasse alone, from the grungy, arty Ä (no 40), with its flea market furnishings and foamy draft beers, to swankier cocktail bar TiER (no 42) just up the street. In summer, head to Klunkerkranich (Karl-Marx-Strasse 66), hidden away on the rooftop of a shopping mall, with a laid-back DIY aesthetic, decent DJs and views over the city. If you want to take things up a notch, Sameheads and Griessmühle will take you through to the next day, sometimes even longer.Where to stayThere aren’t many hotels here, but the Hüttenpalast (from €70 a night) is quintessential Berlin with its self-builtdecorated caravans and huts inside a former factory. Paul SullivanThe Powiśle district’s main boulevard on the left bank of the Vistula was once the preserve of dodgy bikers and lonely fishermen. Thanks to Poland’s economic boom it now resembles a carnival every summer, when the temperature usually tops 30C. Time to abandon preconceptions that Warsaw is grey and cold because in the best part of the year it really is green and hot. Pubs and riverboats offer craft beers and cocktails, with street food ranging from pierogi dumplings to pho soup (Warsaw has a big Vietnamese community). Powiśle was on the frontline in the Warsaw uprising against Nazi Germany and wears its shrapnel scars with pride. It’s fitting that the district is now all about people having cycling, roller-blading, volleyball, trampolining, picnics, people deckchairs, ice-cream, live music, dancing and playing in the sandfun. See and doIn the summer, the best way to approach Powiśle is by the free, seasonal tramwaje wodne (water trams) that ferry people to and from the wild beaches on the opposite bank of the river, or with a Veturilo city bike (March-November only) – your first 20 minutes is free. The major Powiśle landmark is Warsaw University Library (open to the public as well as students), which has an impressive facade of copper panels with texts in Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Old Russian and Old Polish. Its roof garden has a spectacular view. The adjacent Copernicus Science Centre is ideal for children, who can spend hours at the interactive displays. For shopping, Femi Stories (Browarna 4) has women’s and girls’ clothing from independent makers. Poland is one of the biggest producers of furniture in the world, and while buying chairs is rarely an option for holidaymakers, Moma Studio (Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie 45) also has unusual home- and kitchenwares. Down towards the Świętokrzyski bridge, Elektrownia (Zajęcza 2b), a former power station, is gradually filling with high-end shops and restaurants – worth a visit for the early 20th-century industrial architecture.Eat and drinkElektrownia’s fine-dining restaurant is Niewinni Czarodzieje 2.0, where options include beef carpaccio with truffles. Warsaw is one of the world’s top vegan-friendly cities, and Powiśle’s established contribution is Veg Deli (Radna 14), with pumpkin burgers and spinach and “feta” ravioli. Also worth exploring are the seasonal barges and street food stalls by the river, which change every year.Where to stayAt Powiśle’s southern edge, Inbed Hostel (dorm bed from £9, en suite double £26 B\u0026ampB) has bright, modern rooms close to the underground. By the riverside park is the mid-range Logos (doubles £45 room-only). A luxury option is Robert De Niro’s Nobu at the Rialto (prices tba), opening in the city centre this spring.Keith LockramNorth of central Prague, on the Vltava’s left bank beyond Letná park, Holešovice was for a long time seen as a bleak district with little to offer locals, let alone visitors. Its impressive resurgence over the past decade or so has been largely thanks to creative and commercial entrepreneurs taking advantage of low rents and empty spaces – apartment blocks, factories – to create a vibrant infrastructure of galleries, shops, cafes, clubs and bars. Although not as postcard-pretty as Stare Mesto (the old town) or Mala Strana over the river, Holešovice’s blend of industrial buildings, 19th- and early 20th-century tenements (with some lovely art nouveau blocks) and occasional communist behemoths makes for interesting meanders, and there are cultural treats aplenty too.See and doHolešovice is home to big hitters such as the sprawling, plane-train-and-automobile-filled National Technical Museum (Kostelní 42), and the Veletrzni Palace (Dukelských hrdinů 47), part of the city’s National Gallery, but there’s plenty of contemporary art on offer too. The Dox Centre for Contemporary Art (Poupětova 1) helped put the district on the map when it opened in 2008, and runs consistently great exhibitions inside a former factory complex. At the revitalised Prague Market (on Bubenské embankment), a former slaughterhouse now houses international theatre and circus space Jatka 78 and the Trafo Gallery. Other hotspots include the Chemistry Gallery near the Hlávkův bridge, cultural centre La Fabrika (32 Komunardů) for theatre and concerts, and the highly popular Bio Oko independent cinema on Františka Křížka street, which hosts events and festivals. For a splash of green, Letná park’s hilltop location offers fine views across the city as well as beer gardens and, a few minutes’ walk north, Stromovka, the former royal game reserve, is the city’s largest green space.Small but vibrant Veverkova street has become a mini-hub for shoppers, thanks to several retail hotspots in close proximity. Right by Bistro 8 (see below) is Garage Store (no 6), for sneakers and vinyl, and fashion store Jakoby (no 8), for unisex coats, dresses and jumpers, plus vintage outlet Recycle With Love. Right across the road (no 7) is the shop of designer Helena Darbujanova, who sells her own chairs, tables and lamps alongside work of other Czech designers, and Page Five (no 5) which stocks an international array of books, magazines, and posters, and also hosts launches and events. Another great event to look out for is the pop-up Mint Market, which brings together Czech interior, fashion and jewellery designers in Prague Market and other venues.Eat and drinkThe range of dining and drinking options here is healthy and growing all the time. There’s a choice of hip breakfast and brunch hangouts, from Cafe Letka (Letohradská 44) with its rough walls and handsomely large windows, to the spacious industrial chic of Vnitroblock (Tusarova 31), which doubles as a gallery and concept store. For tasty Czech pastries and cakes, head to the simple Erhart patisserie (Milady Horáková 56). The stylish Bistro Jankovcova (Jankovcova 14a) has sweet or savoury breakfasts, soups and salads, and Bistro 8 (Veverkova 14108) serves Sunday brunches, brisket burgers and pulled pork tacos. For dinner, check out swanky SaSaZu in Prague Market, which matches Asian fusion cuisine to regular DJ sets, or Bar Cobra (M Horáková 8), whose menu s mezze plates, wild boar with noodles, and a great selection of wines and cocktails. If you still have energy to hit the dancefloor, grungy Cross Club (Plynární 23) has live shows, DJ nights and themed parties pretty much every night, while the slicker Mecca (U Průhonu 3) is the spot for house music all night long.The Ostiense neighbourhood, right on the Tiber river, was once the site of a power station, a restless river port and a gasometer, whose skeleton still looms. It’s named after Via Ostiensis, an arterial road that ran in ancient times from the city’s cattle market to the port town of Ostia. Today, Ostiense has shaken off its industrial past to become a bastion of new restaurants, street art and bars. A scattering of campuses mean there’s a big student population, but there’s also an international crowd, drawn by reasonable rents and a metro link to the city centre. Come here to eat sumptuously and admire historic sites far from the masses.See and doOne of the city’s four major basilicas, St Paul’s Outside the Walls on Piazzale San Paolo 1 enjoys a quiet stream of visitors, a far cry from its more famous counterpart, St Peter’s. While it suffered a fire in the 19th century and underwent lengthy repairs, its ancient mosaics and 13th-century cloister were spared. The latter serves as a lovely spot to unwind after a day’s sightseeing. Further down Via Ostiense lies Centrale Montemartini, arguably Rome’s most underrated museum. Originally an electricity plant, the space was abandoned until 2005 when it was chosen to house artwork from the overcrowded Capitoline Museums. Seek out its delightfully jarring juxtaposition of delicate classical statues and defunct diesel engines and turbines. Head north towards Trastevere and the city centre (keeping an eye out for vibrant street art) and have a look round the Non-Catholic Cemetery, the final resting place of Romantic poets and former Rome residents John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Via Caio Cestio 12). The ancient pyramid of Caius Cestius, constructed in about 12BC, keeps a staid watch over the cemetery. Visitors are allowed inside the pyramid on a guided tour the third and fourth Saturday and Sunday of every month (entrance on Via Raffaele Persichetti).Shops aren’t Ostiense’s forte, but cheese, olive oil, pasta, wine and other edible souvenirs can be purchased from gastronomic megastore Eataly, on the south side of Ostiense train station. Beyond the basilica, zero-waste shop Negozio Leggero sells anything from beauty products to chocolate to spices, all packaging-free (Via Chiabrera 80).Food and drinkLocals and expats flock to restaurant and micro-bakery Marigold (Via Giovanni da Empoli 37), run by Sophie, who’s from Denmark, and her Calabrese partner Domenico, for its cosy atmosphere and homely dishes. Instead of the traditional Italian breakfast of caffè and cornetto (croissant), they serve dishes like eggs benedict, pancakes or fluffy cheese omelettes. At lunch and dinner there will be handmade pasta and plenty of vegetable-lush dishes too.Doted on by critics – it even made the Michelin Guide’s coveted Bib Gourmand list this year – Trattoria Pennestri (Via Giovanni da Empoli 5) flirts with both traditional Roman and gourmet cuisine. Tuck into a glossy plate of carbonara, or mains such as roasted octopus with peppers, mint and yogurt and suckling pig with porcini mushrooms and myrtle. There’s no chance you’ll wangle a table without booking.Staunch titans of cucina romana such as tripe, cacio e pepe, and salt cod anchor the kitchen of Osteria Fratelli Mori near the cemetery (Via dei Conciatori 10). It’s also one of the rare Rome restaurants that can easily accommodate a large group. Once the sun goes down, head to Caffè Letterario (Via Ostiense 95), a cafe, bookshop and cultural space that moonlights as a cocktail bar. In hot weather, sip a glass of red on the terrace at T-Bar (Via Ostiense 182) or in the Instagrammable courtyard of Porto Fluviale (Via del Porto Fluviale 22). For late-night munchies, chocolate-chip-studded sweet buns from Il Pangocciolaio (Via dei Magazzini Generali 15) hit the spot.Where to stayGasometer Urban Suites (studio with kitchenette from €86) is a former wool processing plant turned hotel with a gym and roof terrace.Alexandra BruzzeseIn between the touristy Skadarlija quarter, the huge Kalemegdan fortress and banks of the Danube, Dorćol has a comfortable air about it that doesn’t immediately scream cool. But it has always been the pace-setter for the city’s bars and restaurants. The tree-lined streets of its southern part – Gornji (Upper) Dorćol – have the usual Belgrade hotchpotch of early 20th-century villas and Tito-era flats, with the occasional art nouveau beauty. This is classic bar territory, with new openings and old favourites alike squeezed into streets such as Strahinjića Bana, Kneginje Ljubice and Kralja Petra.But head into Dornji (Lower) Dorćol towards the Danube and things get grittier, with funky little cafes, craft breweries, arts centres and street art taking over rundown industrial buildings. It’s not pretty, but it’s where things are moving along briskly.See and doDorćol Platz (Dobračina 59) in Dornji Dorćol is a collection of old industrial buildings that have been transformed into a nicely scruffy cultural centre with a cafe and garden. It hosts everything from gigs and vinyl markets to festivals, including the Mikser Festival of Design, held each May. From here it’s a few minutes’ walk to the Museum of Science and Technology (Skenderbegova 51), whose exhibits trace the story of technology in Serbia in an entertaining way. Fans of vintage gear should check out Jane Doe Vintage Shop (Kapetan Mišina 17) and its larger concept store and bar (Gospodar Jevremova 25). Dorćol isn’t particularly awash with green spaces, but it does have a lovely, wide cycle and footpath along the Danube, and past Novak Djokovic’s Novak Tennis Centre.Eat and drinkThe choice of bars and restaurants in Dorćol is quite dizzying. There are traditional and long-established favourites on leafy Strahinjića Bana but a short walk to the south, Blaznavac (Kneginje Ljubice 18) serves £4 cocktails and £1.50 pints of beer in a fantastically bonkers garden and equally eccentric interior. It’s just a few feet from Iris New Balkan Cuisine (Kneginje Ljubice 11), which does more elegant versions of hefty Serbian dishes, including pork neck (£7).The craze for craft beer hasn’t passed Belgrade by: there are several brewpubs around Dorćol. Gvint Brewery in Dorćol Platz is a genial place to try lagers and ales for about £1.50 a pint. At Beogradski Market (Žorža Klemansoa 19), craft breweries such as Dogma and Tron share the vast hangar-like space with food stalls selling anything from tapas to sushi.In the midst of Dornji Dorćol’s street art and ramshackle former workshops, fine-dining restaurant Homa (Senjanina Ive) stands out with its gleaming white minimalism. Plates of poached trout with trout roe (£14) and steak tartare with bone marrow (£12) are pricey by local standards, but worth it.Where to stayFifties decor meets industrial chic in Smokvica B\u0026ampB (doubles from €65), with six airy rooms in a 1929 villa in Upper Dorćol. Its lively bar and restaurant spills into a courtyard garden. Mary NovakovichThe 20th arrondissement, in eastern Paris, is well-known for the place where Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf are buried, but a short walk away, hidden from the crowds, is a genuine village, Charonne, little known to tourists. Circular Place de la Réunion, laid out in 1850, is the heart of this friendly, bohemian quartier populaire, a multicultural area of working families, artists and musicians. The square comes alive on Thursday and Sunday mornings, when it teems with people browsing market stalls set up by butchers, cheese- and fishmongers, and fruit and vegetable sellers.But there is another hub here that is open every day, from 7am to 2am. Café Sans Nom, on the corner of rue de la Réunion, does not need a name (or a website) as it is more a community centre for everyone living in or passing by the square, from school-run mums or pensioners sipping a coffee while reading newspapers and books from the cafe’s free library, to the crowd who arrive for drinks after midnight.See and doYou won’t find chic boutiques in this neighbourhood, but rather quirky, ethical shops such as L’Escargot d’Or (53 rue de Bagnolet) where Gilles Coolen roasts fairtrade coffee beans and makes delicious artisan chocolate. On the other side of the street (no 52), Agnès Baracco stocks Au Bon Vingt, her pioneering natural wine cellar, with over 400 varieties, which she loves explaining to visitors. At no 69, La Botica (no 69) is a new shop and gallery showcasing young artists, designers and stylists, with changing themes that cover photography and illustration, jewellery and vintage clothes, prints and ceramics.Eat and drinkEveryone’s favourite Sunday begins at 6pm in the funky Quartier Rouge bistro (52 rue de Bagnolet), which hosts a weekly three-hour jazz jam session. Entry is free and a glass of wine is €3.50, but be sure to contribute when the musicians’ hat is passed round. It also serves tasty no-frills French cuisine, but for a bit more choice, take a five-minute walk to romantic rue des Vignoles, which is lined with laid-back bars and restaurants. La Petite Fabrique (no 15) is a spacious bio-canteen offering a perfect combination of organic cuisine (maybe vegetarian paella, juicy beef tournedos or a vegan sweet potato gratin with seitan sausages) and natural wines, served at long communal tables.Almost next door, Les Mondes Bohèmes (no 31) is a popular hangout whose verdant covered terrace resembles a greenhouse it’s great for salads, burgers and ice-cream.Wander down some of the narrow plant-lined alleyways (impasses) off rue des Vignoles – perhaps the evocative Impasse Satan or bucolic Impasse Poule – and imagine the time when this was all vineyards, la campagne à Paris. For a last drink, finish up at the arty Moki Bar (no 61), enjoying its kitsch 1970s decor and pinball machines, exhibitions, funky music and great mojitos.Where to stayRecently renovated Hôtel Terre Neuve (doubles from €99 room-only) is five minutes’ walk from Place de la Réunion, but the fashion-minded may prefer the Philip Starck-designed Mama Shelter (doubles from €139 room only), the first of this now-global hip hotel chain.John BruntonLooking for a holiday with a difference?

But now I’m no longer a citizen …London in the 1950s and 60s was an ebullient, technicolour time. But it was also an era during which most of monochrome Britain regarded “the Continent” as a place of “rabies and intellectuals” – as New York Times journalist Roger Cohen, raised in north London, put it in a book about his mother.I didn’t care about rabies, and wanted to meet and emulate the intellectuals. When I was in my mid-teens, fuelled by the uprisings of 1968 in Paris and Prague, the world – my life – began when the ferry pulled out of Dover. Clutching my blue SNCF rail ticket, watching the cliffs recede with a sense of liberation, across the choppy Channel to dock in Calais, transferring to the Paris train, traversing the capital to Gare de Lyon and boarding an overnight iron horse to points south. Destinations: Provence, or Italy, or Austria, or the then-turbulent Basque Country and Spain.I was in a dotty band then, and wrote a silly rocker entitled Down to ’Spaña which opened: “Were you ever on that night trainLeaving Paris in the pouring rain?To greet the light of Dordogne dawn-breakC’mon move now, huhDown to ’Spaña.”I relished those journeys, staring out at sulphur-yellow lamps illuminating stations and goods yards. As a (much better) John Cale song puts it: “Looking out from hereAt half past France.” You’d hand your passport to Italian customs at Chiasso on the Swiss border – this no longer happens, of course – then head across the Po valley, through cypress-strewn hills in Tuscany and Lazio and on to Rome, exhausted, happy, blinded by the light.Come the 1970s, most of my generation saw Europe on an Interrail pass, which afforded unlimited travel for a month. But I travelled à la carte, loth to hurry around. I didn’t want to leave a place until I’d come to know it a bit, established myself with the clientele of a bar on some cobbled square, fully explored the museums and backstreets, perhaps even caught a football match.Apart from one summer in Chicago, this was how I spent every Easter and summer holiday, and every penny earned – to change into lire, francs, schillings or pesetas. Then came the moment to cast my first vote in 1975: over whether Britain should remain a member of the then European Economic Community. I had finally come “home” – and a decade or so later, I would have the words “European Community” on my passport.I had worked hard on French at school, and took Italian lessons in the evenings, aware that I needed a toolkit of vocabulary and grammar. It’s one thing to take a taxi from Seville’s Santa Justa station and rely on the driver’s pidgin English it’s quite another – and works out cheaper – to ask whether he is a palangana (supporter of Sevilla FC) or a bético (fan of rivals Real Betis, after the Roman name for the city’s Guadalquivir river) and why.I wore Kickers shoes, even though I disliked them, because they were originally made in France and looked ‘“continental”. In the mid-70s I bought my first car – a Citröen 2CV – in Brussels, so that the steering wheel would be on the “wrong” side in Britain. Two Renault 5s followed in the same vein – it was 20 years before I bought a car with a steering wheel on the British “right” side (a sturdy Volvo, still on the road, from the then editor of this newspaper).I didn’t want to be a tourist I wanted to be a European. A true “cosmopolitan”, as envisaged by Diogenes, who coined the term. For me, to be European is existential. It’s about who and what we are. It defines a way of being, sans frontières, a state of curiosity about the way other people live and a burning need to partake in it, speak their tongues and understand not just their cultures but their quotidian modus vivendi: beliefs, music, football, food, firewater and wine.Of course, I arrived in the Americas and elsewhere, but that belonging was never on offer. Being European was, and I duly took my citizenship not from Britannia, but from the Phoenician princess, mother of King Minos of Crete – Europa – and the words “European Union” on my passport.I’ve travelled the far corners of Europe, and occasionally lived between them: from County Mayo’s wild seaboard, to fishing villages along the Black Sea shore and Danube delta, and the rocks of Ikaria island in the south-east (though I don’t claim to speak Romanian or Greek). From midnight sun and midday darkness in the Nordic north to the passeggiata beneath Mount Etna in Catania, Sicily, and the docks of Tarifa in Andalucia, from which a good outfielder could attempt a throw into Africa.We had wonderful but purposeful, busy and focused family holidays across Italy and France, scouring minor museums in small towns. In between were picnics with wine – my mother sketching people in cafes, my father etching church architecture. I got my first-ever job at the Vienna Staatsoper in January 1973 and enrolled at the University of Florence later that year. When friends hit the hippie trail east, I stayed in Italy, preferring to investigate Bologna and Milan. Except for exploring the Americas, I returned scores of times, mainly to Italy, France and Belgium and the Netherlands. I had a Swedish life for a while, for failed romantic reasons.I travelled not to “holiday”, but to conjoin European life I read newspapers, not guide books. I wanted no part in the fantasies of Brits in Tuscany or Provence I travelled for work, for pleasure, for language, art and football, for the musky scent of old stone, light and landscape, love and love’s wreckage – out of deferential but insatiable curiosity, to listen and learn. If a holiday, or money, ran out halfway along a valley, I’d endeavour to return to the same place, and carry on up or downriver.In 1990, my dream came true, and I was posted to Rome by this newspaper. I didn’t deliberately shun expats and the international press I just preferred to hang out with Italian colleagues, friends, rogues and neighbours, watching AS Roma, Juventus and SSC Napoli, where I had a season ticket.By then something remarkable had happened to Europe. Back in 1981, my work had taken me to Poland, and early cracks in the communist edifice, following the 1980 strike at the Gdansk shipyard. Then, in 1989, I had found myself reporting from Berlin and Bucharest as Stalin’s walls crumbled.The dream that Europe’s reunification could be peaceful twisted into nightmare across former Yugoslavia, but there was this: how would one have replied to a whisper on the wind through the Croatian town of Vukovar, as I reported it being levelled into the dust of its own stone by Serbian artillery in 1991, predicting that within 30 years, this place would be in the EU, and London out?On Mayday 2004, I was in Warsaw with friends from Gdansk days celebrating Poland’s accession to the EU – an affirmation as important to them as being part of the union was to me. Later that night, I was with a “Polish noise” band shattering rusty ironwork in a disused factory – and so began a relationship with that country too.The closest rapport, though, is genetic, and part of my life since I wrote a university thesis on the Irish Troubles in 1974, more interested in Belfast and Derry than any dreaming spires of Oxford. My bond to Ireland was bequeathed by two Irish grandmothers. Ireland is now Europe’s most interestingly changed country – in large part because of the EU – and one of its youngest, demographically. For decades, people like the great writer Edna O’Brien left what they saw as the myopic and inward-looking green-letterbox island off the coast of Britain for the breezy cosmopolitanism of red-letterbox-land. Now the roles are reversed – inward-looking England and Wales off the coast of international Ireland.Where did all this lead “my” Europe? The continent became an entity and identity, not necessarily in people’s self-perception, but in living-breathing reality. Some 400 million people cross 26 countries without having to show their passport, under the Schengen treaty. There are now 2 million “Erasmus babies” born to students from all over Europe, under the inspired 1987 scheme whereby any student in the EU can study and settle in any of 28 countries – now 27. How marvellous is that?Millions of people whizz, work and abide across a continent not without its problems, but without internal seams. And remember: they are the grand- and great-grand children of those who endured slaughter in the first world war. Children and grandchildren of a Europe ravaged by Holocaust and the second world war. Children of the cold war and Berlin Wall. Have the Italians, Dutch, French, Romanians, Latvians and Portuguese lost their identity to this process? No, they’re just part of it. Nor did the British, and we were part of that too but now we’re not. I was all my adult life, and now I’m not. In 2008, I submitted an article to the Observer on the slipstream of England’s failure to qualify for the 2008 Euros (played in Austria and Switzerland), arguing that this was a metaphor for what Europe would look like without Britain – calmer actually, without England’s awful fans.Fair Europa, fare thee well – and thou shalt, without us. I’ll still savour your ways, your beauty and your tribulations – but as a visitor, not a citizen.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Looming over the race is fellow candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who has decided to completely forgo New Hampshire and all other early primary states to instead invest heavily in the crucial set of Super Tuesday states that vote on 3 March – an unconventional and risky strategy.Bloomberg is “spending millions to buy the election,” Sanders warned this week.“How do we feel about living in so-called democracy when a billionaire multiple time over can do that? How do we feel when we have candidates in the Democratic party taking money from billionaires?”Having spent at least $10m on a 60-second advert in the Super Bowl last week, Bloomberg has since capitalised on the chaos from the Iowa caucuses, in which both self-described Democratic socialist Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and moderate former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg declared victories, though the race was officially too close to call.Former vice-president Joe Biden, who had been seen as the frontrunner among the moderate candidates, trailed in fourth and called the Iowa result a “gut punch”. Bloomberg, who has cast himself as the moderate to beat Trump and banked on Biden falling behind, responded by doubling his advertising spending.At a press conference about the Iowa results, Sanders said it was “an absolute outrage” that Bloomberg would also likely qualify for the next televised presidential debate in Nevada later this month, when he is not even on the ballot there. “I guess if you’re worth $55b you can get the rules changed to debate.”Besides eschewing the early primary states, Bloomberg has opted to self-fund his campaign and has poured in over $188m. He has also quietly been working to bottleneck funding avenues for other the campaigns of other candidates by urging deep pocketed donors to give to Democratic committees instead.While other candidates have doggedly toured New Hampshire and early primary states, Bloomberg has been campaigning in locales that are later on the voting calendar, like Oklahoma, California, Colorado, and Pennsylvania. Bloomberg has already visited every Super Tuesday state in a two-month period.“Since day one, our campaign has been focused on building a nationwide operation that is engaging with voters daily about Mike’s record on key issues and why he’s the strongest Democrat in the race,” Bloomberg states director Dan Kanninen said.“While other candidates focus on New Hampshire, we’re committed to winning delegates on Super Tuesday and beating Donald Trump in November.”His campaign has ballooned to 2,100 people, with 1,700 of them in the states and 400 at the campaign’s headquarters in New York. Other campaigns have staffs in the hundreds. By the end of this week the campaign says it will have opened 125 offices.Whichever candidate emerges as the presumptive frontrunner after the early primary contests end with the South Carolina primary on 29 February, they will then have to face a moneyed Bloomberg effectively lying in wait to attack.Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic party chairwoman who has endorsed Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who placed third in Iowa, said even though Bloomberg isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire his presence is still felt.“We see the ads here in New Hampshire although he’s not on the ballot here,” Sullivan said. “I think he will be a major factor going forward because of just the amount of money he’s spending and because he’s playing in all those Super Tuesday states.”And some New Hampshire voters are intrigued. Bill Mauser, a US Navy veteran who attended an event for Buttigieg this week called Bloomberg an “interesting prospect”.“He’s a very accomplished self-made man, doesn’t have a retail politics approach,” Mauser said. “He certainly has chops but the question is, are his chops good enough to really qualify him to be a leader? So how do I feel about him? I’m open to what he has to say.”For his rivals, the critique of Bloomberg is almost always the same: that he’s buying his way into the presidential election.During Friday night’s televised Democratic debate, Warren was asked about the seeming unlimited amount of spending behind the former New York mayor’s candidacy. She said: “I don’t think anyone should be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States.”During an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union in January, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, another Democratic presidential candidate, likened Bloomberg to Donald Trump.“When people look at the White House and see this multi-millionaire messing up so many things,” Klobuchar said. “I don’t think they think, ‘Oh, we need someone richer.’ I think you have to earn votes, not buy them.”But Bloomberg’s strategy is causing some Democrats to recalibrate how they think of the primary calendar. Maura Keefe, a Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen, said Bloomberg’s massive spending calls into question just how valuable winning an early primary state is these days.“The money piece is what’s the monetary value of winning New Hampshire or winning and coming in second,” Keefe said. “What is the value of that free press? That attention? We’re already seeing the value of Buttigieg’s surprise in Iowa for him here. And if somebody surprised in New Hampshire by beating expectations there’s a monetary value in that.””But Keefe added that she didn’t see Bloomberg as a trending topic among votersyet, just “a topic of conversation certainly amongst the media and maybe political elites.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

Another six UK nationals are being kept under observation in French hospitals.The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Haute-Savoie region in the eastern French Alps when they were visited by a Briton who had been in Singapore and was found to have the virus when he returned to the UK at the end of last month.The French health minister Agnès Buzyn said none of the patients were in a serious condition. She described the new outbreak as a “cluster, grouping around one original case”.Jean-Yves Grall, the head of the regional health authority, told journalists the child lived in the ski resort with their parents and two siblings. The child’s mother was in the UK taking exams and the children were with their father. The six other Britons were in a second apartment in the same chalet. He did not give details of where the visitor believed to have brought the virus from Singapore had stayed.The local health authority is disinfecting the building and is searching for anyone who might have come into contact with the group.Grall said the infected child had attended school in Les Contamines-Montjoie and had recently spent a day at a second school in the nearby town of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains.He said the schools would be shut next week as the authorities tried to determine with whom the child had come into contact.Édouard Philippe, the French prime minister, called a meeting of health ministers on Saturday and the ministry has opened a UK hotline (0800 100 379) in an attempt to find out who else may have been in contact with the Britons.Buzyn said: “We’re starting an important operation to identify cases of those in contact.“That original case was brought to our attention last night. It is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between 20 and 23 January, and he arrived in France on 24 January for four days.”As well as the five who tested positive for the virus, the others were being kept under surveillance in hospitals in Lyon, Saint Etienne and Grenoble.The Briton at the origin of the cluster returned to the UK on 28 January, a French health official said.Grenoble hospital said it was not authorised to give any more information.The local newspaper Le Dauphiné, reported that Marie-Charlotte Pasquier of the Les Contamines-Montjoie tourist office had spent the morning reassuring tourists in the resort. There has been no public announcement but the town hall has been distributing leaflets with advice on how to avoid transmitting coronavirus. Local doctors have sent a consignment of disinfectant and face masks to the town hall.Pasquier said: “We are in permanent contact with the local health authorities and have put in place a number where people can contact and ask questions and a doctor will reply. We are there to inform and reassure people.”The latest outbreak brings the total number of people infected with the virus in France to 11. Health officials said some of the original six cases, who are being treated in hospital in Paris and Bordeaux, were ready to be released.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. Five new cases in France are British nationals, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.This Saturday is one of the busiest days of the year for French ski resorts because it is the start of school holidays in the Paris region. The February holidays in France begin on three consecutive Saturdays and are staggered over five weeks.At a newsagents shop in Les Contamines-Montjoie one resident said local people were worried.“It’s not just the news but the disinformation that’s worrying,” she said.Other shops and hotels referred callers to the local town hall.Les Contamines-Montjoie, 75 minutes from Geneva and sitting between Chamonix and Megève, has a population of about 1,160 people, which increases during the tourist season in winter. It is close to Mont Blanc and popular with mountaineers and skiiers. The word contamines does not mean “contaminated” as some supposed on social media but “ploughable land on the squire’s estate”.Meanwhile, a student in Brighton has been told to self-isolate after a confirmed case of coronavirus, according to Sky News. The middle-aged man was the first British national to contract the virus after he travelled to the UK from Singapore.In a message sent to parents on Friday, Portslade Aldridge community academy (Paca) said: “Today we have been contacted by a parent of a student at Paca who was contacted by Public Health England as part of their investigation concerning the confirmed case that was reported in the press yesterday.“We have been informed by the parent that they have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate their child at home for 14 days. If at any point the child is found to be symptomatic we will be notified.” Four members of a British family living in Mallorca are being tested for coronavirus after coming into contact with a person who recently tested positive for the virus in France.The Balearic Islands health department said the father of the family had gone to Mallorca’s Son Espases hospital after feeling ill and was placed in isolation. His partner and their two daughters were being evaluated in the same hospital.The health department said it had activated its coronavirus protocol. “In accordance with professional guidelines, the man remains in isolation and all members of the family have been tested and the tests sent to a laboratory. All remain at the hospital,” it said.The department urged people to remain calm while the tests were carried out and said it was working closely with Spain’s health ministry.Spain confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on 31 January after a man was diagnosed on the remote La Gomera island in the Canaries.The patient is part of a group of five people in isolation and under observation on the island after it emerged they had come into contact with a German man diagnosed with the virus. US officials have announced that a 60-year-old citizen had become the first foreign victim of the coronavirus in China. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, having had symptoms consistent with the disease.A US embassy spokesman in Beijing told Reuters: “We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. Out of respect for the family’s privacy, we have no further comment.” A British man with the virus is said to be feeling well and in good spirits after being transferred from the cruise ship Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan.Alan Steele, of Wolverhampton, who was on honeymoon on the ship, was moved to hospital on Friday while his wife, Wendy Marshall Steele, remained onboard. She had been in telephone contact with her husband and said on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy.“Alan is well, Japanese doctors are excellent,” she posted on Facebook. “He is in a little room. Just doctor and nurse visit him.” She said she was also doing well but had “cabin fever” as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship.There are nearly 3,700 other passengers and crew being quarantined on the ship. They have been offered access to mental health counselling and enhanced internet access.In a video posted on Twitter, Rai Caluori, the executive vice-president at Princess Cruises, said: “We recognise that a situation like this can create unprecedented stress, so we’re also offering our guests and crew specialised telephonic mental health counselling if they should be experiencing such stress and mental health issues.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b057eefa18c635ae35e88179662d45f9cdef47/0_82_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a42f8433d9b2746f80d9b3a8d61b92","title":"ireland general eleciton sinn fein surge to 22 in exit poll","story":"Republican party level with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in Saturday evening’s poll Sinn Féin has scored dramatic gains in Ireland’s general election, according to an exit poll on Saturday night, realigning Irish politics and boosting the party’s chance of joining the next government.If replicated in actual results it would signal an unprecedented tie among the three parties, leaving it unclear which, if any, could woo smaller parties and independents to form a parliamentary majority and ruling alliance.The party’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, cast the party as a leftwing agent of change that would break up the duopoly of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, centrist rivals that have alternated in power for a century.Sinn Féin, shunned by voters as the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles, also tapped voter frustration at hospital bed shortages, insurance costs, pension reform and a sense of being left behind by economic growth. The party’s agenda for Irish unification, and Northern Ireland in general, took a backseat in the campaign.However, Sinn Féin fielded too few candidates to fully translate its surge into extra seats in the new parliament, meaning it is likely to trail Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the 33rd Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament.However, the allocation of seats in the 160-seat chamber remains unclear. Counting of votes will begin on Sunday, with full results expected on Monday or Tuesday. No party will win an outright majority, obligating party leaders to negotiate coalitions.The Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, had hoped to surf the public mood for change but the exit poll showed his party also slipping a few points – possible punishment for its confidence-and-supply deal that propped up Varadkar’s administration.Varadkar and Martin have ruled out working with Sinn Féin, and Martin also ruled out a coalition with Fine Gael, leaving it unclear if either man will be able to muster a majority.Both will come under pressure from some party colleagues to form a grand centrist coalition. Some Fianna Fáil members are expected to lobby Martin to make a deal with Sinn Féin.

He was referring to the M5 highway, which links the state capital, Damascus, with the northern city of Aleppo.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said government forces still had 18 miles (30km) of the highway to clear before it came under full control of the army for the first time since 2012.Syrian state TV reported on Saturday that government forces captured four villages in Aleppo province near the highway. It added that Syrian troops and demining experts had cleared explosives from the recently captured town of Saraqeb which sits on an intersection of the M5 and M4 highways, linking Syria’s coast with the country’s east.Turkey, a main backer of the opposition, sent more reinforcements into Idlib overnight, according to the Observatory and the Idlib-based media activist Taher al-Omar who is embedded with militants.The Observatory said a convoy of 430 vehicles had entered Syria since Friday night, raising the number of vehicles to have entered the country since last weekend to well over 1,000.A rare clash between Turkish troops and Syrian soldiers earlier in the week left seven Turkish soldiers and a Turkish civilian dead as well as 13 Syrian troops.On Friday, Turkey’s defence ministry said the army would respond “even more forcefully” to any attack on Turkish observation posts in the area.The violence has raised tensions between Russia and Turkey, which have been working together to secure ceasefires and political talks despite backing opposite sides of the conflict."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd47aaec7cf8a3a7d4f4b24f20bf677ef71cf8/137_455_3095_1857/master/3095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fa5b3ff45fb48c713f5b0702950e6af","title":"miss world contest 1970 new film misbehaviour jennifer hosten first black winner","story":"It was the era of apartheid in South Africa, the civil rights movement in America and women’s liberation in Britain. And they all came together at one of the most-watched live television events of the time, when feminist protesters stormed the stage at Miss World 1970, and a black woman walked away from the beauty contest with the crown for the first time.Fifty years on, that night is being retold in a film, Misbehaviour, inspired by the memoir of Jennifer Hosten, who won the contest and made history. In the decades that have followed, the one-time beauty queen has come to the conclusion that she and the women disrupting the competition had more in common than they might have thought.“I didn’t realise it fully at the time but we were all using that contest as a way to get a message across,” she told the Observer last week. “For me it was about race and inclusion – for them, it was about female exploitation.”Hosten, who came from the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada to scoop the crown at the age of 23, was peeking through the stage curtain at the Royal Albert Hall, a few feet from compere Bob Hope as he delivered his now infamous opening remarks.“I don’t want you to think I’m a dirty old man because I never give women a second thought,” he said. “My first thought covers everything.”“He was struggling,” remembered Hosten, now 72. She recalled hearing a firecracker go off and seeing people running scared. But the huge bang was from a group of well-dressed women who had started pelting the US comedian with flour bombs, then rose up in outrage. “We’re not beautiful, we’re not ugly. We’re ANGRY!” they screamed.The supposed firecracker was actually a football rattle, sounded by a women’s liberation activist and designed as a cue for the other feminists strategically planted among the audience to leap into action. The plan had been to kick things off when the contestants were on stage being paraded around in their swimwear, but Hosten says the women were so outraged by Hope’s jokes that the rattle went off early. “It was a big deal then, it’s still a big deal now!” she added.Watched on TV by over 22 million people in Britain, and 100 million worldwide, the incident was seen as a galvanising moment for the women’s liberation movement and is to be retold in the film starring Keira Knightley, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jessie Buckley later this year. Hosten’s memoir, Miss World 1970, will be published next month.But for Hosten it was also a big win for racial equality. Not only was she crowned Miss World but her friend, Pearl Jansen from South Africa, was the runner-up. Organisers had been shamed into sending her, a black contestant, at the last minute but Jansen had to be known as Miss Africa South because there was already a white Miss South Africa.Hosten recalls Jansen telling her there was a reason for black women being represented at the contest that was “much more important than just representing our country”.Her success, however, outraged sections of the tabloid media. The Sun newspaper presented Hosten’s victory as a conspiracy by black members of the judging panel. “How else could a black girl with 25:1 odds have walked away with the title? That’s what they were saying,” she said.And it wasn’t only the press. Eric Morley – the then head of the Miss World beauty business – had handpicked 15 of the 58 contestants for a dress rehearsal the night before the event, parading them before the cameras. “They were his favourites,” Hosten said. “But only one of them – Miss Guyana – was a woman of colour. The rest of us were told to go and sit down with the audience.”Hosten was shocked. Growing up in Grenada she had not thought much about skin colour. That changed when she arrived in Britain for the show.“It was such an eye-opener, seeing the way the media only saw beauty by European standards. It was supposed to be Miss World – people of different races and different cultures. Most of us were written off before we even started.”It made her participation much more meaningful, she said. “It made me want to win.”When she did just that she was celebrated right across the Caribbean. In 1970 Grenada still didn’t have independence from Britain, so it was an opportunity to put her small country on the map. “I showed off my country and showed that women can do anything,” she said.In the 50 years since then, the world has moved on. Last year, for the first time in history, Miss World, Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss America were all won by women of colour. “The question is, though, why are we talking about that?” said Hosten. “The fact that we’re talking about it as a big deal means to say that it is still a big deal.”Misbehaviour is released on 13 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611b759ed2d1355b50e03f18b733db9b3a4c8109/0_84_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=575b78129e55b898943b57e148b8ccf7","title":"moria refugee camp doctors story lesbos greece","story":"On the Greek island of Lesbos is the Moria refugee camp, constructed for 3,100 people but now with a population of more than 20,000 men, women and children. It has become a place of violence, deprivation, suffering and despair. I am a doctor from London and I have just spent three weeks working for the Boat Refugee Foundation (BRF). This was my third time there – and my most shocking.I kept a diary of the cases I saw, thinking it would be cathartic after the chaos to read through one or two major incidents, for personal processing purposes. Little did I know how much the events from just one day would catch in my throat on re-reading. And the next day, and the next. I want to tell you about one day in the life of the little portable cabin clinic where I worked. I am the narrator of the stories of the people still there this is not about me.People queue outside the wire-fenced cabin for hours before the clinic opens at four, hoping to be able to speak to a doctor about their child’s rash, their pregnancy-related abdominal pains, their hallucinations and flashbacks from witnessed violence, their sleep disturbance, their itch from having to wear nappies at night for fear of having to go to the toilet in the pitch-black camp. There has been no reliable electricity in the camp for more than two-and-a-half months now (with 20,000 people trying to use a grid made for 3,000, it constantly trips and cannot be relied upon for any period of time), and the threat of violence and sexual violence is incredibly high. Women and minors largely choose to wear nappies to avoid having to leave their tents after the sun goes down.They come with infected wounds that need cleaning and bandaging they have minimal access to clean water out in the olive grove areas. They come with the infamous “Moria flu” and a whole range of chronic problems one would normally expect in a population of this size. Any chronic problems are advised to come back to doctors working in the daytime: this clinic is for acute care only, for emergencies only. And we work at full capacity.Patients can only enter with their police papers, known as their ausweis, which contain their photograph, name and number. They are triaged at the door by one medic alongside a translator in Farsi and Arabic. “Green” patients need urgent care “yellow” patients are severely unwell with abnormal vital signs and require a full examination on a bed “red” emergency patients usually suffer from major panic attacks, extreme pain, collapses and, increasingly, life-threatening stab wounds or the results of other violence.We are a team from across the world – when I was on Lesbos there was a mix of Dutch, French, English, American and Spanish doctors, nurses and support crew. We work together with our translators (refugees living in the camp themselves, volunteering daily in return for bus tickets, phone credit, education and dinner as they are not able to stand in the food queue while working with us) from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Somalia and the Congo. We make up the clinic team, and respond together as the crowds enter.A mother comes in with her four-year-old child who has a very high fever, and who hasn’t been eating, drinking or responding to her properly for hours. To get to the cabin, she has had to walk through the camp on the side of a steep hill, weaving between UNHCR and makeshift tents, past the falafel store, the Wave of Hope for the Future school with its new library, past the barbers and people doing their washing, past the rubbish that hasn’t been cleared for a month, past the gang of wild dogs barking and running after her. She has waited patiently in line in the cold. When the gate is unlocked there is a rush of people, each shouting that they are an emergency, waving their ausweis.I call the febrile child in. The mother is crying and the father looks ashen-faced as he explains through the Farsi translator that they are worried as the child won’t drink and looks tired. He has heard that another child from a nearby tent is now in hospital in Athens with a brain infection. He looks at the floor, apologises for attending, but asks for help.Just as I start examining the child, I can hear shouting and the sound of someone being dragged along the gravel outside. The support crew member on the back door shouts “red patient” and I move the febrile child into the back space of the cabin, pulling the bed out and making space for the emergency. He is a young man in his teens, unconscious, dragged in a dark grey blanket by four people from the surrounding tents. He was seen to be shouting and screaming and then collapsed, breathing very heavily and not waking up. The men have been running with him unconscious in the blanket for 10 minutes to reach the medical area.I start the tests on him. As I go to inflate the blood pressure cuff, he opens his eyes and screams – a long, sustained scream, followed by extreme hyperventilation and rigidity in his arms. This is a classic picture of a panic attack associated with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and a common presentation to the clinic. We are fortunate to have a psychiatric nurse in our team, and once any more sinister pathology is excluded, we move the man to a back room to rest and be reviewed by her, to plan onward referral and care.In terms of mental health help for refugees, there are currently two referral pathways for the more severe end of the spectrum, but each takes time and depends on exposure to violence, sexual violence, and previous history. In the acute phase we provide emergency care for these patients and their friends, relatives and tent-mates, who listen to them cry at night, and drag them to the clinic in blankets when they have attacks.Despite seeing multiple patients suffering with panic attacks every day, the sound of the screams still shocks and chills me as I wonder: what have you seen? What are you still seeing? I can’t comprehend it. And when we send them back to their tents, I feel ashamed.I continue, with the help of my translator, to see patients in the “yellow” queue, mostly children with fevers, adults with abdominal pain, pregnant women, minors with scabies. We are busy today, as we are every day there are a lot of people to see. As the sun goes down, I always feel the atmosphere at triage and inside the clinic changes. I get a sense of desperation and hostility, not usually played out, but always at the back of my mind. Because there is no electricity in the camp, the darkness outside is engulfing. Our clinic runs on the grid, regularly tripping out, and we carry out our consultations by the glow of head torches and battery-operated lights.An entire family is dragged in, two of the four children unconscious and the father appearing confused, shouting about “fire”. Apparently they went to a neighbour’s tent where a fire was lit for warmth after sundown, and have been exposed to carbon monoxide for a sustained period of time. We start oxygen from our transported cylinders on the children who are not responding, wrap them in emergency blankets, and call the ambulance, while checking over the others. We have only two oxygen tanks so rotate them in response to clinical need. The ambulance will not drive up to the clinic (a short distance from the front gate of the camp) for safety reasons after dark unless in extreme emergencies, so we run the children down to the ambulance when it arrives, connecting their masks to the oxygen in the ambulance and sending them on their way. They have started responding by the time they are in the ambulance, and we know they will be OK.The hubbub created by another “red” patient draws close and echoes around outside the clinic. This time two young men from the sections for unaccompanied minors are dragged in between friends, gasping and covered in blood. Both have been stabbed in the chest. One stabbing like this in London would receive emergency trauma care from a highly trained team, probably in a major trauma centre. In Moria, this is not the case.I call all five doctors and the emergency nurse to the cabin and we split into teams, with two translators at each bedside. The majority of doctors are not used to dealing with acute stabbings: BRF has not actively recruited for emergency doctors previously, as we were offering more clinic-based urgent care. We had gone through some team pre-hospital trauma care earlier in the week and have had daily exposure to stabbings by now, so we get to work putting in lines and assessing each patient. We now have only one oxygen tank as we used the other on the children with carbon monoxide poisoning.We prioritise the boy with the central chest stab as he appears to be having repeated apnoeic episodes. As we wait for the ambulance to arrive, the other one starts to gargle and choke. One of his lungs is filling up with air and blood where he has been stabbed. We switch the oxygen tank to him, while stabilising the other boy’s bleeding, and plan how to extricate both on stretchers from the tiny clinic room. We put in an emergency needle to decompress the damaged lung. It works for a few minutes, then fills with blood again. We decide to decompress that side of his chest with a cut to his chest wall. The tension is released, for now. The translators – non-medical but now accustomed to this type of emergency – grab oxygen masks, gauze and cannula dressings, and squeeze in fluid like members of a trained trauma team. Their resilience and care for their fellow refugees nearly chokes me.As the ambulance arrives, we beg them to come down to the clinic gates to minimise the time transferring the boys in the freezing cold. They agree and also agree to take both boys at the same time – a rare occurrence, but last week a young man died from a stab wound and we work together in the dark shadow of this memory. We take the boys out in emergency blankets, with fluids and lines in place, on stretchers, in front of the patients waiting to be seen in the cold, gravel-floored cage that is the waiting room. I go back to debrief the team the translators are already cleaning the blood from the floor, beds and walls.We see the next patients. We keep going. People keep arriving and we continue to try to keep them safe in whatever capacity we can.At the end of our clinic time, the responsibility for the medical care of patients in the camp is down to a lone “army doctor”, who cannot be accessed by patients unless the police deem them to have a serious enough medical problem. Unless there is a life-threatening emergency, they will wait until the day clinic opens at nine. People queue in the dark from 6:30 to try to get help.This is not abnormal. This is daily. The next day we had a 16-year-old boy, again from the supposedly protected sections, fall through the back doors of the clinic with a knife still in his back. On the last night I was working we saw four life-threatening stabbings, including a stabbed neck and an open chest. We assessed and stabilised them all and got them to hospital. As far as I’m aware, all of these patients are still alive.There has been no electricity in the camp now for two and a half months. We know about the direct correlation between light and crime – people have been requesting an end to this darkness. It has not come.The sections for unaccompanied minors and vulnerable women consist of fenced areas with sleeping cabins inside, locked in a secure area near to the police and new arrivals areas. They are understaffed. s work hard to keep the most vulnerable safe, but with boredom and violence still prevalent, and staff often not speaking the same language as the refugees, monitoring and care is stretched, and problems continue to spiral. With finite space and an infinite number of increasingly vulnerable people arriving, many minors and women are living alone outside the sections, at risk of abuse, violence, and systemic failings.The boredom in the camp is maddening and the asylum process is opaque. Even those of us with contacts in other NGOs and with lawyers cannot work it out. During my time there, one of our most calm, loyal, and impressive translators was arrested after a second rejection and deported without papers, and without a lawyer. We have still not been able to contact him. We do not know where he is and we do not know the details of his rejection. We know he will not be safe back in Afghanistan. This kind of thing reaches through the camp, adding to the feeling of resignation and hopelessness. And the madness continues.The suffering is palpable, the hopelessness is insidious, the feeling of abandonment is all-consuming. I have not done a special job here. I have gone to volunteer, as many have before me and many continue to do while I return to my home, where I have central heating, regular food I can choose, and my freedom – and all of these afforded to me only by my luck at birth.Moria refugee camp is at breaking point the situation is about to implode. This will happen inwardly, harming some of the most vulnerable people in the world. The implosion will probably cause a tiny ripple of outward explosion, and then be forgotten. The world continues to turn its back. We must open the conversation once more, we must consider taking responsibility for our fellow humans. I have no solution, but I want to give a voice to these silenced people, and hope there is a willing audience prepared to begin to listen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84b2f43fac4b68715e0e6d424929091177c15bad/0_298_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0edb737c5b9ba1800a2e416fb1750d3","title":"uk universities in china face shutdown over coronavirus","story":"British universities are braced for a long shutdown of their Chinese campuses after Beijing said it would extend the closure of China’s higher education sector into March to combat the spread of coronavirus.Nottingham, Birmingham City and Leeds universities were among the many UK higher education providers told they must delay the return of academics and students until 2 March, after they were initially told to keep their Chinese offshoots closed until 24 February.The decision to extend the shutdown of higher education throughout China until next month is expected to be a clear signal to other parts of the country’s education system to prolong the winter break, which started in December and includes the lunar new year, until the virus is under control.Beijing has allowed local authorities to use their own judgment about when to open schools and locally controlled universities later this month, but the move to extend the closure of centrally funded and regulated universities, which includes foreign-owned campuses, is expected to persuade most local officials to follow Beijing’s lead.More than 35,000 people in China and 24 other countries have contracted the virus, and hundreds have died. The Beijing authorities have effectively quarantined a string of cities stretching from Wuhan, where the outbreak started, to the east coast and asked anyone who suspects they have flu-like symptoms to seek medical attention.Most major airlines have suspended flights to China, and governments in the region have blocked Chinese nationals from leaving the country. The US, Australia and Singapore have blocked all foreign visitors who have recently been to China. Some 30,000 Britons in mainland China have been advised to leave, although it is unclear whether they will be allowed to travel with their spouses. The last government-chartered repatriation flight out of Wuhan is due to depart on Sunday.City streets and shopping malls in China have largely been deserted for the last two weeks, leading western retailers to shut their stores. Apple, which relies on China for about a fifth of its store sales, has closed its shops and offices until further notice. Starbucks closed almost half of its 4,300 outlets in China, leading to a dramatic fall in the price of coffee on international markets.The upmarket fashion retailer Burberry said wealthy Chinese consumers were staying away from its Chinese shops and travel restrictions had curbed overseas shopping sprees, leading to a dramatic loss of business.Cuts in factory production across the country’s industrial heartland have also pushed down the price of oil from almost $70 for a barrel of Brent crude a month ago to $54 last week.In the last week, the car firm Fiat Chrysler has warned that it will need to shut one of its European factories unless the virus is brought under control and shipments of vital parts and electronic components are restarted from Chinese ports.She said the university would be able to cope with a degree of disruption over the coming months. “The university has longstanding contingency arrangements to amend semester dates and provide additional learning resources and support through online methods.”Birmingham City University has 1,000 Chinese students at its joint venture with Wuhan Textile University – the Birmingham Institute of Fashion and Creative Art. A spokesman said: “Wuhan Textile University was closed for the lunar new year, and its reopening will be a matter for our Chinese partners. We are in close communication with our partners and the UK government to understand the impact on our students.”Liverpool University has a joint venture with Xi’an Jiaotong University, which has 32,000 students and is based north-east of Wuhan.

This may be just as well, since a rare plant, ringed suddenly by too many boots, has no means of flying away.Today’s botanists, however, increasingly young, keen and anoraked, do spike one occasion with adrenaline: the new year plant hunt on January 1st. How many flowering plants could you list in three hours of scouring the local ground? Even more competitively, who is to claim the First Flower of the Hunt? The really keen, it seems, have it photographed by torchlight shortly after midnight. On New Year’s Day 2019, for example, one Ger Collard from Tralee, Co Kerry, submitted pictures of five plants before 12.30 am.Collard is a member of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI). Its acronym was adjusted in 2013 from its claim to the whole “British Isles,” such had been the historical weight of visiting experts from next door. Some would have laid a colonial claim to the Burren. But Ireland’s sterling fieldwork for a massive new flora secured us our rightful placeIts latest plant hunt, the ninth, involved 1,714 people, from Shetland to Guernsey, Donegal to Norfolk, west Cork to Kent. Often searching in family groups, they recorded more species in bloom – 615 – than ever before.The highest totals, predictably, were from the south and west of both islands. Swanage, on the UK south coast, had the longest list of 115. In fourth place came 85 species at Ballycullane, Co Wexford, from experienced Irish recorder Paul Green.The long-term objective of the hunt is to see how the wildflowers of these islands are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate. In the survey’s brief record, the latest hunt was pretty average. “We can’t yet prove that more species are flowering in mid-winter,” says Dr Kevin Walker, the BSBI’s chief scientist. But the hunt has already shown that, in milder winters, more plants flower because of warmer temperatures and fewer frosts.On January 25th, a Kerry reader sent Eye on Nature a cheering photograph of lesser celandines in flower, a week or two ahead of normal schedule. But only 24 per cent of the BSBI’s new year flowers were springtime specialists such as celandine and primrose, so there was “no indication of an early spring”.Indeed, more than half were wayside autumn stragglers such as yarrow, ragwort and hogweed. And the leading species, topped by daisy, groundsel and dandelion, commonly offer mid-winter blooms.The ready use of common wildflower names, where appropriate, alongside the Latin binomials of Linnaeus, marks the modern informality of botany. It’s true that in papers at Ireland’s spring conference in the National Botanic Gardens, something such as festuca grasses may be salted with Latin names – that’s science. But, more and more, diligent amateurs are joining surveys with professionals, enlivening online websites and blogs, and painlessly absorbing the weighty fistful of Webb’s Irish Flora.Ireland even has a team known at the Rough Crew, led by Dr Rory Hodd, “ecologist, botanist and montivagant, with a passion for liverworts, mosses and mountains”. A montivagant is, indeed, a wanderer over hills and mountains, and Hodd inspires an adventurous troupe of young followers – typically three women and five men – to seek out the plants of rain-soaked ledges on the high, rocky scarps and ravines of the west.Much of this is pursued on the mountains and islands of Co Mayo, where the rocks themselves are of infinite variety and interest. That is, if one could master enough geology to tell them apart and fit their shapes and stories into the landscape.An engaging encouragement has been published by Mayo County Council in Reading the Rocks (€15 in local bookshops). A geological audit produced an impressive choice of more than 100 significant sites in Mayo, some of international note, such as the metamorphic rocks of the Mullet Peninsula, 1.75 billion years old.From these, two geologists at NUI Galway, Dr Ronan Hennessy and Prof Martin Feely selected 21 sites to show the great range of Mayo’s geological story. Many are strikingly photogenic, such as the great sea stack of Dun Briste at the tip of Downpatrick Head. And “there is never the necessity”, the publisher warns, “to hammer, dig or collect samples”.Carrowniskey Strand, south of Louisburgh, is well featured in the book. It was my own early hunting ground for huge and beautiful pebbles, glacially gathered and rounded in the sea, and Reading the Rocks would have helped me with their story before the great storms that swept so much of them away.A stubborn obstacle to enjoying books about geology is their unchippable sediment of science-speak. This one has a generous glossary, usefully unpacking the information condensed into single terms. But arriving at, say, “ophiotic melange”, I think I’d still rather scramble through the awns, bracts, corymbs and corollas of botany."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Housing and health rated most important issues majority feel they did not benefit from economic recoveryIpsos MRBI poll shows three main parties set for extraordinary tie in their share of the voteNationwide orange alert active until noon with risk of flooding in coastal areasSinn F\u0026eacutein is Dublin\u0026rsquos most popular party and in all age groups except over 65sHung D\u0026aacuteil almost certain when election votes countedAnalysis: Sinn F\u0026eacutein growth is reminiscent of Labour\u0026rsquos Spring Tide in the early 1990sDay of week, Ireland rugby match and approaching storm may impact final numbersGarda\u0026iacute find equipment including cocaine press during search of Kildangan houseWhat do you need to vote?

Photograph: Collins Counting of votes cast in Saturday’s general election is under way in count centres across the country.Ballot boxes were opened at 9am and counting is likely to continue for a number of days.Early tallies are starting to emerge and with 16 out of 121 Sligo boxes open in Sligo Leitrim , Sinn Féin is marginally ahead on 21 per cent while Fianna Fáil is on 20 per cent , according to the tally.Fine Gael is on 10 per cent, Labour 4 per cent and Greens 2 per cent.The poll was taken today at 250 locations across the State, among 5,376 respondents who had just voted.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireFianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin are set for an extraordinary tie in their share of the vote in Saturday’s general election, according to the results of the Ipsos MRBI exit poll, with all three parties winning almost the same share of the vote.The poll was taken today at 250 locations across the State, among 5,376 respondents who had just voted.

The Greens are at 13 per cent, Labour at 8 per cent, the Social Democrats at 6 per cent, Solidarity at 7 per cent and independentsothers at 8.5 per cent, the poll estimates.In the rest of Leinster, the poll estimates Fianna Fáil at 26 per cent, Fine Gael at 22 per cent, Sinn Féin 24 per cent, the Greens 7 per cent and Labour 4 per cent. In Munster, Fianna fail were at 26 per cent, Fine Gael 25 per cent, Sinn Fein 18 per cent and the Greens at 7 per cent.In Connacht-Ulster, Fianna fail were at 22 per cent, Fine Gael 23 per cent, Sinn Féin 20 per cent and the Greens 7 per cent. Labour is at 2 per cent and the Social Democrats and Solidarity 2 per cent, the poll estimates.The Sinn Féin vote was strongest among younger voters. Among 18-24 year olds, Fianna Fáil were at 14 per cent, Fine Gael 16 per cent, Sinn Féin 32 per cent and the Greens 14 per cent.Among 25-34 the figures were broadly similar, except for a drop-off in Green support. Among 35-49 year-olds, Fianna Fáil 22 per cent, Fine Gael 21 per cent and Sinn Féin 22 per cent.\u0026nbspAmong 50-64 year olds, Fianna Fáil was at 23 per cent, Fine Gael 22 per cent and Sinn Féin 23 per cent. Among over 65 year-olds, Fianna Fáil was at 30 per cent, Fine Gael 30 per cent and Sinn Féin 12 per cent.Saturday’s vote comes after a campaign in which a desire for change among voters became the central theme, with all opposition parties jostling for the mantle of change, and even Fine Gael, in government for nine years, promising change if re-elected.The results of the poll have been announced simultaneously by The  and on RTÉ 1 television.Exit polls carried out for The  by Ipsos MRBI have in the past predicted the election results with a high degree of accuracy.Our political team will offer news, insight, analysis and opinion as the count unfolds on Sunday and Monday with stories on every constituency and analysis of who might form the next government.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4166977.1581205012!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"exit poll by numbers who voted what way and where","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin’s  Mary Lou McDonald votes  at St Joseph’s School in Dublin on Saturday.

Photographs: Yui MokPA Wire, Bryan MeadeEPA, Gareth ChaneyCollinsIf the RTETG4 exit poll is borne out by the actual election results, it will result in one of the most dramatic realignments in Irish politics since the foundation of the State almost a century ago.Up until the 1980s, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were supported by well over four-fifths of voters – four decades later, the support levels for the two parties has dropped precipitously. The two parties who between them controlled each and every government now only enjoy the support of a little over two-fifths of the population.What the exit polls tells us is that there is effectively a three-way tie between Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin with only a percentage point separating each of them.A word of warning while the sample is very large, 5,000 people, the margin of error is 1.3 per cent.If the parties are equal in terms of percentages, that is not going to work out in terms of seats. Sinn Féin’s percentage of support will not be reflected in the number of seats it wins, purely because it has not run enough candidates.On these figures, if it had run a second candidate in Dublin South Central, Dublin Central, Dublin South West, Dublin Bay North and Cork North Central it would have had a really good chance of taking a second seat in most of those constituencies, a little like Labour did in 2011 when it had the “Gilmore Gael”.Sinn FéinIn its wildest dreams in the months before the election, Sinn Féin did not see itself vying with the two big parties for supremacy – hence a very conservative approach to candidate selection based on the belief it might lose seats.So in terms of comparison, the closest comparator is the Labour Party in 1992, under its then leader Dick Spring. In that election, Labour’s percentage share of the vote leaped from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in what the media dubbed The Spring Tide. However, like Sinn Féin now, the party had not run enough candidates, and ended up with 33, which it could easily have won 40.It’s going to be similar for Sinn Féin here if these figures are borne out. The party can expect to win about 32 seats if its rise in support levels are consistent all around the country, an increase of ten from its present complement.Of those you could say that Padraig Mac Lochlainn (a second seat in Donegal) Pauline Tully (a second seat in Cavan-Monaghan) Paul Donnelly (Dublin West) Rose Conway-Walsh (Mayo) Darren O’Rourke (Meath East) Johnny Mythen (Wexford) would be strongly favoured to become TDs. And then others such as Chris Andrews (Dublin Bay South) Mairéad Farrell (Galway West) Sorca Clarke (Longford-Westmeath) and Claire Kerrane (Roscommon-Galway) are all in the frame for a final seat.You look elsewhere at the other leafy south Dublin constituencies, at the two Kildare constituencies, and in Meath West (where former member Peadar Tóibín is a TD) and it looks less likely. But then in 1992, an unknown candidate Mosajee Bhamjee won a seat for Labour out of nowhere.In lots of constituencies, the Sinn Féin candidate will top the poll, with a considerable surplus. Sinn Féin voters do not transfer as readily as other parties. But in general, it transfers to left-wing candidates in urban constituencies and (slightly more) to Fianna Fáil in rural constituencies. Mayo would be a good example of that in 2016.Left-wing TDsSuddenly, it means the fate of a whole raft of left-wing TDs who were independent or belonged to smaller groups looks more feasible. Solidarity-People Before Profit could end up returning most of its TDs – it’s only when it’s in direct competition with Sinn Féin, such as in Dublin West, that it might lose out.So what of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Both will return more seats than their percentage should reflect, with a considerable seat bonus of between ten and twenty over Sinn Féin.Where a relatively unknown Sinn Féin candidate is presenting a threat in a constituency you might see the phenomenon of tactical transferring from one party to the other to keep Sinn Féin out. That might be evident in constituencies like Roscommon-Galway and Longford-Westmeath where Sinn Féin will be duelling with a major party for the last seat.However, no matter how big the bonus, on these figures neither Fianna Fáil (which looks likely to be the biggest party) or Fine Gael will have any hope of forming a coalition without a new confidence and supply agreement, or else by going in with Sinn Féin. The numbers look uncertain.Green growthFine Gael could be reduced to a single seat in most of its constituencies and without a seat in a number of new constituencies. Fianna Fáil hopes of winning a seat in five Dublin constituencies where it had no representation might need to be modified a little in the light of these figures.Gains targeted by both parties might need to be jettisoned. Indeed, one or the other is facing losses in constituencies like Wexford, Meath East, Mayo, Galway West, and Dublin Bay South.The Green party looks like it will become the fourth biggest party on these numbers. The 8 per cent national support is close to the results of the last  Ipsos MRBI poll which showed it had 16 per cent support in Dublin. If that figure is replicated it has the potential of winning an extra six seats in the capital, and perhaps, one or two around the State. It looks like it will end up with seat numbers close to double figures.For the Labour Party, it’s not looking so rosy. If the party’s national support level is truly at 4 per cent, it’s going to be difficult for the party to make gains and it could also see one or two of its five outgoing TDs losing their seats, bringing the party close to questions being asked about its future solvency.At 3 per cent, both the Social Democrats and Solidarity-People Before Profit could both end up with a smattering of seats, with the latter salvaging something from the jaws of defeat.There was a narrative for the past year that the tide was going out for Independents. But at 16 per cent in this exit poll, if its findings are borne out, it could end returning roughly the same number of TDs as were in the 32nd Dáil.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Coronavirus latest news: Brit in Spain tests positive as final evacuation flight out of Wuhan lands in UK Storm Ciara: \u0026#39Danger to life\u0026#39 warnings as 80mph winds to batter BritainComment: If the government is going to press ahead with HS2, here\u0026#39s how they can save money doing it Storm Ciara: Forecasters warn of \u0026#39danger to life\u0026#39 as 80mph winds set to batter BritainAmid mud and misery, Greek plans to address refugee crisis on Aegean islands met with scepticismComment: The hidden scandal of rural crime is killing our countrysideComment: Where are all the conservative thinkers who should be rebalancing public life?Here comes The Sun: British-built probe heads to centre of the Solar System  Rename not so \u0026#39common\u0026#39 animals, says Countryfile presenterMillions of people using \u0026#39dangerous\u0026#39 electric blankets, experts warnFirst Christian garden at Chelsea Flower ShowButtigieg accuses Biden of belittling small town America as leading candidates address packed arenaThailand mass shooting: gunman killed after rampage which left 20 deadIreland\u0026#39s three largest parties are neck and neck suggests general election exit pollCoronavirus latest news: Five British people diagnosed in French ski resortProsecutors allow dozens of charges brought against terrorists to ‘lie on file’New think-tank set up to tackle Islamist extremism in wake of Streatham attackWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/06/TELEMMGLPICT000223842622_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1jEdJGp1DKo6SYFsq2yaf75ws8sJUBhAUl1PTGiIJZM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"someone like kirk douglas could never make showbiz today","story":"Kirk Douglas, pictured here with wife Anne Buydens, came from a surprisingly impoverished backgroundReading the obituaries of the actor Kirk Douglas this week, I was fascinated to discover that he came from such an extremely impoverished background. Born Issur Danielovitch to Russian immigrant parents in New York, speaking Yiddish at home, his autobiography was called The Ragman’s Son: ‘Even in the poorest section of town, where all the families were struggling, the ragman was on the lowest rung on the ladder. And I was the ragman’s son.’ He had more than 40 menial jobs before becoming an actor.We’ve grown sadly used to “creatives” coming from privileged backgrounds. Entertainers go to private school, attend Oxbridge, fall in with a few like-minded types. And then they spend their spare time in a gated community telling the rest of us to embrace illegal immigrants.Films were hard physical work back when Douglas was young – often four a year, back to back – and male stars usually had “proper jobs” first. Interestingly, this mirrors the situation in what’s been called “show business for ugly people”, i.e. politics. (Tracey Brabin, she of the shoulders, turned down a place at drama school because she had no money and “didn’t know anybody” – leading to the surreal situation where it appears easier for a working-class woman to become a Member of Parliament than a member of Equity).Women were more often plucked from obscurity for their youthful beauty but they might also be hired for rigorous physical skills like swimming, skating or ballet dancing. Where you were from didn’t matter the ragman’s son could become Spartacus and the madwoman’s illegitimate daughter could become Marilyn Monroe. A new name and you were good to go, born again.But then, sometime in the Sixties, with the end of the studio system, it became respectable to be an actor – and the slow process of shutting out those from underprivileged backgrounds ground into action. Nepotism is like Japanese knotweed, growing and spreading and choking out any rebellious, delicate young shoots so the son of Kirk Douglas would effortlessly follow him into the trade.Sean Penn, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie, Kristen Stewart, Daniel Radcliffe, Scarlett Johansson – all have parents in show business. It makes me laugh to think that both of Robert de Niro’s parents are painters: not decorators, but artists. And he always seems so deliciously primitive, my dear!We are used to the SADS – the Sons And Daughters of the famous – routinely taking all the fun jobs in a way we thought we’d seen the back of during the brief benediction of Sixties meritocracy, to the point where the son of Liam Gallagher and the grandson of Ringo Starr – both 18 – being in court for an alleged late-night altercation with staff in a Hampstead (where else?) branch of Tesco Express makes perfect weird sense.And they’re starting them ever younger Beyoncé trademarked her daughter Blue Ivy’s name when the tot was only four years old. When met with opposition from a Boston-based wedding planning business of the same name, the singer’s lawyers reportedly asked the US Patent and Trademark Office to dismiss the “frivolous” opposition, arguing that the by-then 7-year-old was a “cultural icon”. Over here, all of the Beckham children – most recently 5-year-old Harper in 2017 – have had their names trademarked by their proactive – sorry, “protective” – mother.It’s not a wild guess to imagine that this type of entitlement will lead to a blander popular culture. It’s interesting to compare Joaquin Phoenix’s woke Bafta blather to Kirk Douglas’ witch-hunt-defying actions in employing a Communist screenwriter (Dalton Trumbo) to adapt a Communist novelist (Howard Fast) when he made Spartacus, at a time when association with black-listed writers could ruin careers. To be Left-wing in Hollywood back then truly was brave now it’s just the new conformity, ticking the ersity box while keeping it all in the family.Coronavirus latest news: Brit in Spain tests positive as final evacuation flight out of Wuhan lands in UK Storm Ciara: \u0026#39Danger to life\u0026#39 warnings as 80mph winds to batter BritainComment: If the government is going to press ahead with HS2, here\u0026#39s how they can save money doing it Storm Ciara: Forecasters warn of \u0026#39danger to life\u0026#39 as 80mph winds set to batter BritainAmid mud and misery, Greek plans to address refugee crisis on Aegean islands met with scepticismComment: The hidden scandal of rural crime is killing our countrysideComment: Where are all the conservative thinkers who should be rebalancing public life?Millions of people using \u0026#39dangerous\u0026#39 electric blankets, experts warnFirst Christian garden at Chelsea Flower ShowHere comes The Sun: British-built probe heads to centre of the Solar System  Rename not so \u0026#39common\u0026#39 animals, says Countryfile presenterButtigieg accuses Biden of belittling small town America as leading candidates address packed arenaThailand mass shooting: gunman killed after rampage which left 20 deadIreland\u0026#39s three largest parties are neck and neck suggests general election exit pollCoronavirus latest news: Five British people diagnosed in French ski resortProsecutors allow dozens of charges brought against terrorists to ‘lie on file’New think-tank set up to tackle Islamist extremism in wake of Streatham attackWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/09/TELEMMGLPICT000168825926_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"starbucks new charity associations leave bitter taste","story":"Starbucks have come up with their new Mermaids cookies in the name of something they present sweetlyIf you enjoy puddle-like coffee and pastries with the texture of rock-cakes then you are doubtless a fan of Starbucks, the horrible American coffee chain which sits on every high street in the world. Meaning you might be happy to learn that this week a fresh morsel was added to the counter of inedible products in the company’s stores across the UK. These are “mermaid” cookies. And as the faux-friendly writing on all the identikit chalkboards at all the depressing Starbucks stores inform customers, these are cookies with a purpose.Starbucks have come up with this particular tooth-rotter in the name of something they present sweetly. Purchase a “mermaids cookie” and a full 50p will be given by Starbucks to the charity Mermaids. So sweet. So innocent. Or sickening. Depending what you know.Personally I view Mermaids as one of the most sinister charitable organisations in the UK. Starbucks simply says that the group supports “young transgender and gender erse people and their families”. The undrinkable coffee chain claims that all those 50 pences will pay to support a helpline for such people. In fact everything that Mermaids pushes is deeply controversial and with implications which need to be properly interrogated.Let’s just start with that presumption – put on all those Starbucks boards: what are “gender erse people”? Does anybody know? Can anybody justify or explain the phrase? I would offer a year’s supply of edible croissants from any of Starbucks\u0027 competitors for anyone who can.Then there is the lobbying that Mermaids puts out to persuade society at large that children who believe – or are encouraged to believe – that they are in the “wrong body” should be helped to change sex. Something which is presented by Mermaids as though it is not just a right but a doozy. Think you’d like to become a girl? Why not give it a go? Vice versa? No problem!Whatever societal madness future historians work out encouraged this fiasco, the most striking aspect of it is that on this matter, as on so many others, the adults all appear to have left the room. People do not question the new orthodoxy. If someone says that certain children should be given puberty blockers so that they can transition into approximations of the opposite sex who are we to question it?So it is fitting that this week the news emerged of a 13-year-old girl applying for a judicial review against Oxfordshire County Council. The cause is the council’s ‘Trans Inclusion Toolkit for Schools 2019’ which Oxfordshire County Council has given to more than 300 schools in the area.Its advice says – among other things – that girls like the girl known only as ‘Miss A’ should share changing rooms, lavatories and even residential dormitories on school trips with any boy who identifies as a girl. Campaigners against accommodation of such ‘self-identification’ say that this advice poses a serious risk to children.Read more | Transgender ChildrenIt will be interesting to see in the months and indeed years ahead who wins stand-offs such as this one. The fact that multinationals like Starbucks can so easily jump on board with the agenda that Mermaids is pushing is just the latest demonstration of how fast this new orthodoxy is being accepted.Meanwhile parents and others who object to this agenda are wrongly portrayed as backwards and bigoted: people who are trying either to make people murder trans people or make trans people kill themselves. Thus with the language of catastrophism is an actual catastrophe mainstreamed into society.What studies there are show that around four fifths of children diagnosed with the highly dubious condition ‘gender dysphoria’ will grow up to be perfectly happy straight or gay men or women – happy in their own bodies.For any sane society this would be just one sign that the claims of the trans extremists need far more investigation than they are currently getting. So how encouraging it is that a 13 year old schoolgirl should try to inject some sense into a debate which nearly all the adults in our society have fearfully, disgracefully ducked.Storm Ciara: \u0026#39Danger to life\u0026#39 warnings as 80mph winds to batter BritainCoronavirus latest news: Brit in Spain tests positive as final evacuation flight out of Wuhan lands in UK Comment: If the government is going to press ahead with HS2, here\u0026#39s how they can save money doing it Storm Ciara: Forecasters warn of \u0026#39danger to life\u0026#39 as 80mph winds set to batter BritainAmid mud and misery, Greek plans to address refugee crisis on Aegean islands met with scepticismComment: The hidden scandal of rural crime is killing our countrysideComment: Where are all the conservative thinkers who should be rebalancing public life?Millions of people using \u0026#39dangerous\u0026#39 electric blankets, experts warnFirst Christian garden at Chelsea Flower ShowHere comes The Sun: British-built probe heads to centre of the Solar System  Rename not so \u0026#39common\u0026#39 animals, says Countryfile presenterButtigieg accuses Biden of belittling small town America as leading candidates address packed arenaThailand mass shooting: gunman killed after rampage which left 20 deadIreland\u0026#39s three largest parties are neck and neck suggests general election exit pollCoronavirus latest news: Five British people diagnosed in French ski resortProsecutors allow dozens of charges brought against terrorists to ‘lie on file’New think-tank set up to tackle Islamist extremism in wake of Streatham attackWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/06/14/beetroot-leaf-dhal-cooking-indyeats.jpg","title":"garden sustainable space how to build tips tricks climate 20 pledges","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.This year, Chris Riotta is growing his own fruit and vegetables – in the middle of New York CityWhether you’re working with a few feet of space in a community vegetable patch, or have 65 acres of luscious foliage on a sprawling estate (looking at you, Oprah Winfrey), the first step to building a sustainable garden is mapping out a vision of your intentions.Each year before planting my own vegetable patch, I draw out an image of the garden I hope to build, indicating where each plant should go based on available sunlight and shading.\u0026nbspI’m currently planning to build the largest garden I’ve ever grown, while working to harvest one-third of my annual vegetable consumption directly from my backyard, as part of my mission for The Independent’s 20\u0026nbspPledges\u0026nbspfor 2020 initiative. While mapping out the garden, I put together a few tips and tricks to help get you started on your own sustainable vegetable patch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlan out where to place your\u0026nbspplantsRoot to fruit: How to join the ethical food revolutionI like to plant crops that grow on vines (think: cucumbers and cherry tomatoes) in small groups, as close to a fence as possible so they scale upwards, while giving other plants that will likely grow much larger a separate space off to the side. That way, I can still walk by and tend to the crops growing up the fence, no matter how big the other plants off to the side eventually grow.\u0026nbspThis also works with smaller plots of soil like community garden space: keep clusters of similar plants in the same tight groups, and don’t worry so much about spacing. With some proper TLC, plants usually find their way around each other in the dirt.\u0026nbspSeeds can always begin growing indoors ahead of the season around the time you lay out your soil, which will provide you with plenty of time to start growing your crops in a stable environment. Some farmers will recommend you transport these seeds to your garden based on the location of the moon, but since I don’t have time for all that, I simply give the soil a good rinse of water for a week before transporting or planting anything in my garden.Study your plotBefore stepping into that dirt, it’s important to study your space and gain an understanding of how many hours of sunlight you’re working with and what kind of plants grow well in the region. Most will require about eight hours of sun, but if you’re in a shaded area and can only get six, that should still work, as many plants favour partial shade and only require about four hours of direct sunlight.\u0026nbspGetting a head start on laying out the groundwork for your garden will help it produce sustainable harvests that last throughout the summer months – and then some. You can look up the last frost date in your region here.\u0026nbspI tend to lay out my organic soil exactly where I plant to grow my garden about six weeks before this date.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Back to our roots: Warming winter vegetables recipes Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Maximise your spaceIt’s also just as important to consider ways to maximise the space while gardening.

Most crops only need a few inches of space for their roots to grow: things like peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and kale can all grow much closer together than most people think. I tend to believe that crops grow better when they’re in close, clustered mixes of similar plants, but that’s just my unprofessional semi-gardening enthusiast opinion.Transplant the seeds to your garden once its warm enough for them to survive in an outdoor climate, but only when the seeds are busting out of their trays or starter pots. The seeds should look vibrant and almost too big for their trays by the time they are brought to the garden for planting.\u0026nbspI tend to believe the first moments catering to a garden and each inidual plant are some of the most important in a life cycle the only way a garden will produce healthy crops is with tender love and care during its birth. These moments of transporting, growing the seeds, placing them into the ground and giving them nutrients and fresh water throughout the process are all vital to the longevity of a harvest.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Independent understands they contracted the virus from the third person in the UK who was confirmed to have caught the pneumonia-like illness. The man, who tested positive for the virus in Brighton, is believed to have returned to England on 28 January before eventually being quarantined more than a week later.Professor Rowland Kao of the University of Edinburgh said: “These cases originating from contacts in Singapore change the game as far as contact tracing is concerned.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“As we know there will be a substantial window of risk around when the cases occurred, as well as the additional risks associated with the British cases, as the French ski resort where they were staying is likely to result in a wide range of international contacts themselves.“We are likely reaching the point where the tendrils of transmission risks reaching out from China are becoming a web, one that would require considerably greater resources to control.”Created with Sketch.China coronavirus: Cases soar of deadly new flu-like virus Show all 113Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Volunteers in protective suits disinfect a railway station as the country is hit by an outbreak of the new coronavirus, in Changsha, Hunan province, ChinaMedical staff transfer patients to the newly completed Huoshenshan temporary field Hospital in Wuhan.

Alongside British nationals, there are other nationalities on board.’’It comes as the death toll as a result of the virus continues to rise, with foreign nationals among those to have died\u0026nbspin China – where all but two of the deaths associated with the virus have occurred.On Saturday a 60-year-old US citizen became the first American to die after contracting the virus.\u0026nbspThe US national, who died at the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, is believed to have been a woman with an underlying health issue,\u0026nbspaccording to the New York Times.American becomes first US citizen to die from coronavirusChina resorts to ‘wartime’ measures in Wuhan amid coronavirus outbreakThe major city that has been turned into a ghost town by coronavirusMan stuck on cruise ship over coronavirus outbreak tweets food reviewsThe deceased was among the\u0026nbsp811\u0026nbspdeaths confirmed by the Chinese state within its borders, with more than 37,000 instances reported on the mainland alongside 25 in Hong Kong and 10 in Macao.In the latest round of figures from\u0026nbspthe central Hubei province which has been worst hit by the epidemic, an additional 89\u0026nbsppeople were confirmed dead across a day, while 2,656 new cases were reported.It means the new virus has killed more people than Sars did in 2002-03, but the proportion of sufferers who die from the infection remains much lower.Beijing has been keen to present the virus as having originated in an unregulated wildlife market within Wuhan – with scientists in China saying the illness may have spread through the illegal pangolin trade in the country.China’s official Xinhua news agency reported that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus strain separated from pangolins in the study was 99 per cent identical to that from infected people. It said the research had found endangered pangolins – the world’s only scaly mammals and one of the most-trafficked – to be “the most likely intermediate host”.But James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at Britain’s University of Cambridge, said the research was far from robust.\u0026nbsp”The evidence for the potential involvement of pangolins in the outbreak has not been published, other than by a university press release. This is not scientific evidence,” he said.“Simply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99 per cent is not sufficient. Could these results have been caused by contamination from a highly infected environment?”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

From there, you\u0027ll see the normal list of everyone you follow, but also the new update.There is an option for looking at the Instagram accounts that appear most in your feed. Those are also likely to be the ones you interact with most, given that Instagram prizes things like likes when deciding what to show, but could also be annoying accounts that post too much.The other option shows users who they interact with least. That can include dozens of people that might be worth unfollowing if their feed or stories are becoming overwhelming.The new feature was found in testing late last year, but has finally rolled out to everyone with a new update and announcement from Instagram.It comes after the app also added the option to see the people you follow sorted by how recently you started doing so. That is similarly intended to allow people to better understand their feed, and get rid of anyone they followed a long time ago but no longer wish to see posts from.Selena Gomez says Instagram is ‘destroying’ some of her generationAll of the features are intended to allow people to have more control of their news feed and hopefully better curate what they want to see.“Instagram is really about bringing you closer to the people and things you care about — but we know that over time, your interests and relationships can evolve and change,” a spokesperson said.“Whether you graduate, move to a new city, or become obsessed with a new interest and find a community, we want to make it easier to manage the accounts you follow on Instagram so that they best represent your current connections and interests.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

They were to be the last pieces of the lunar surface to come back to Earth, since humanity has not been back in the nearly 50 years since.That means that those remaining samples are especially precious since they are limited and can not be easily replaced. They can also be profoundly illuminating, offering us our only chance to get close to rock taken from a whole separate world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It\u0027s the first time a lunar sample has been studied like this. We\u0027re using a technique many geologists haven\u0027t even heard of.Scientists to make air out of lunar dust amid plans to live on MoonAs researchers make use of the new technique, they expect to find a vast set of new information about the lunar surface.We can apply this technique to samples no one has studied, Philipp Heck, a curator at the Field Museum, associate professor at the University of Chicago, and co-author of the paper, adds. You\u0027re almost guaranteed to find something new or unexpected.This technique has such high sensitivity and resolution, you find things you wouldn\u0027t find otherwise and only use up a small bit of the sample.The technique is called atom probe tomography, and involves incredibly precise manipulation of inidual grains. It has previously been used in industrial processes – but the new breakthrough has come in turning it for the first time to lunar samples.It works something like nanocarpentry, said Professor Heck: like a carpenter shapes wood, we do it at the nanoscale to minerals.The sample is placed inside a special probe and then shot with a laser that knocks off inidual atoms, which then fall onto a special plate. Researchers can examine those elements by timing how long they take to hit the detector – since heavier ones take longer – and so the type of atom can be worked out.It has already helped researchers see the weathering and materials that can be found inside the lunar soil. That in turn could help future astronauts as they move to live on the Moon, since they could survive by taking resources out of that dust.The researchers now hope they can get hold of samples from elsewhere on the Moon, and elsewhere in space, to allow them to better understand the makeup of the worlds that surround us. They compare our current understanding to analysing Earth using only one mountain range – to get a fuller grasp, they will need to examine a variety of terrains across the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a depressing fact that films directed by previous winners have more chance of being nominated than those directed by newcomers.Because of this, the\u0026nbspbest film in any given year almost never wins the evening’s most coveted prize – in fact, it’s sometimes\u0026nbspnot even\u0026nbspnominated in the first place.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOver the decades, there have been countless glaring omissions\u0026nbsp– films that were nominated but were beaten by far inferior films\u0026nbspand classic films\u0026nbspthat failed to secure a single nomination.As the 2020 Oscars approach – a ceremony that’s fast becoming a two-horse race between a film that actually deserves the top prize (Parasite) and a film that does not (1917) – we’ve run through 20 brilliant films that you would have expected to be a\u0026nbspBest Picture winner, but weren’t.Click through the bellow gallery to see what films made the listCreated with Sketch.Oscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf. While he won an Original Screenplay Oscar, his film was beaten by Forrest Gump......and it wasn\u0027t the only one. Frank Darabont\u0027s adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s prison-set novella The Shawshank Redemption also fell victim to Robert Zemeckis\u0027 Oscar-friendly Forrest Gump. We don\u0027t see that film sitting atop the IMDb top 250 though, do we?If Heat was released today, there\u0027s no way it wouldn\u0027t be a Best Picture frontrunner. That it was completely ignored in favour of Braveheart is a huge travesty.You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo, but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler\u0027s List, Steven Spielberg was strongly expected to take home the top prizes for his Second World War epic. Cue Shakespeare In Love upsetting everybody.David Fincher\u0027s Facebook drama got shunned in favour of British patriotism in an Oscar two-horse race for the ages that ultimately saw The King\u0027s Speech crowned winner.1823 We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)Lynne Ramsay has directed two films that would have been deserving of Best Picture: You Were Never Really Here and this, We Need to Talk About Kevin. It\u0027s easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it\u0027s clear which film will stand the test of time.It\u0027s almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers\u0027 Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win. If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years. Jordan Peele may have taken home the Best Original Screenplay award, but the stars aligned for Guillermo del Toro\u0027s fantasy The Shape of Water instead.Roma was strongly expected to become the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture.

I made one mistake in life, and it feels like I tried to kill the Queen’A man who has been in the UK since the age of 11 and has a British baby is set to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica within days.Reshawn Davis, 30, was detained last Friday and told he would be removed to Jamaica on 11 February – on the second charter flight to travel to the country since the Windrush scandal two years ago.He is being removed from the country on the basis that he was convicted for robbery 10 years ago under the now-unlawful “joint enterprise” rule –\u0026nbspfor which he spent two months in prison.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Jamaican national, who lives with his British wife\u0026nbspand six-month-old daughter in northwest London and has not committed any crime since his conviction, said the thought of being ripped from his family and returning to a country he has not been to for 20 years terrified him.\u0026nbspUp to 50 other Jamaican nationals have been detained in recent weeks and are set to be deported on the same charter flight, which has been the subject of mounting controversy.A draft copy of the Windrush Lessons Learned report, leaked to the media on Thursday, said ministers should consider ending the practice of deporting people who arrived in the UK as children – prompting calls for ministers to halt the removal of iniduals like Mr Davis until it is published.Detainees are meanwhile struggling to access legal services to pursue challenges against their removal directions due to a mobile phone outage at Heathrow removal centres, which the Home Office has only just begun to resolve despite being aware of the issue since 13 January.Speaking from Colnbrook removal centre following the decision, Mr Davis, who has no family or friends in Jamaica, told The Independent: “I’m so stressed out. I can’t even explain how I feel. Yes I was born in Jamaica, but I was brought up here. I don’t know anything else. I made one mistake in life, and it feels like I tried to kill the Queen.\u0026nbsp“I look at my daughter’s pictures now every night before I go to bed. Since she was born I never had never spent a night without her until I was locked in here. I still reach for her when I wake up. I’m not one of those to leave my wife to do it by herself.

I won’t be able to. That’s not something I wanted because I don’t want to sit down and rely on benefits. I’ve always worked. I’ve never been on benefits in my life.“I never imagined being a single mum. I don’t want to fall into the statistics of young single parents, especially for something that isn’t my fault and could have been prevented. It’s hard, emotionally and I would need help financially because it is hard having a young baby.“Reshawn is a great dad. He’s been here all the time with her. She loved him. He does a lot – feeds her, changes her, plays with her. A child needs their dad. I don’t know what’s going to happen now.”Mr Davis’s solicitor made representations for him to remain in the UK this week on the basis of family ties\u0026nbspbut it was ruled on Friday that he did not have a “genuine and subsisting” relationship with his wife or child and that it would “not be unduly harsh” for them to be without him.Rachel Meates, a solicitor from Irving Legal who is representing Mr Davis, said she was shocked that despite having provided a birth certificate, a marriage certificate and photographs, his relationship with his family\u0026nbspwas not being believed.“The Home Office has been quite manipulative in shutting down the arguments. There was enough evidence put in to suggest it was a genuine relationship – and I don’t know what more evidence we can submit from a five-month-old,” she said, adding:\u0026nbsp“It highlights the culture of disbelief that comes with the hostile environment.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The planned charter flight to Jamaica is specifically for removing foreign criminals. Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing class A drugs.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It feels like I’m losing my mind’Ministers have admitted a mobile phone outage at removal centres has prevented people from accessing legal\u0026nbspservices to challenge their deportation, days before a charter flight is set to leave the UK.The Home Office has been forced to admit it has known about the issue affecting detainees’ mobile phone signals in detention centres near Heathrow airport since 13 January, but took 23 days to begin providing detainees with working sim\u0026nbspcards – during which it pressed ahead with charter flights to Ghana, Nigeria and France.Campaigners accused the government of removing people from the country without giving them their lawful right to legal advice and assistance during\u0026nbspthe “crucial window” leading up to the removal flights.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPeople who are due to be deported on a charter flight to Jamaica on Tuesday told The Independent that as a result of the outage, they had struggled to communicate with their solicitors and send them relevant documents to challenge their removals.Mobile phones provided by the Home Office at the outset of detention are the principal means by which detainees are able to access legal assistance, contact their solicitors and stay in touch with their families.Government told to review deportations days before charter flightEchard Bepart-Woollett, 27, who came to Britain when he was eight\u0026nbspand has two British children, said he had been struggling to communicate with his solicitor since the Home Office issued him with deportation orders last week.“I can’t get hold of my solicitor – the only chance of getting out of here. It’s getting mad. It feels like I’m losing my mind. It’s like all communication has been shut down. Everyone is trying to get hold of their solicitor to see what’s going on,” said the Jamaican national.“If they don’t get the paperwork, I can’t go to court, I can’t fight. It’s black and white. You need everything documented and proven, and if I can’t get that out, then I’m f***ed.”Mr Bepart-Woollett’s solicitor, Marina Khan of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said her client had a strong case\u0026nbspto remain in Britain but that the mobile outages had meant filing submissions to challenge his deportation has taken much longer than normal.“We were trying to contact him every day since he instructed us on 31 January, and it took us until 6 February\u0026nbspto formally take details instructions from him. It’s been awful. His partner was stressing out,” she said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He’s been totally deprived of contacting his legal representatives and unable to access legal justice and advice from us.”MPs Nadia Whittome and Dawn Butler raise the issue of people on next week’s deportation flight to JamaicaAnother detainee, Reshawn Davis, 30, who came to the UK at the age of 11 and has a British six-month-old baby,\u0026nbspsaid the signal issues were “extremely frustrating”.“People are telling me they’re trying to call me and I don’t see the call. My phone just doesn’t ring. I haven’t spoken to my solicitor directly at all because of the signal. It’s been a huge added stress. I don’t know what’s going on,” he said.“It’s stopping me talking to my family as well. My daughter knows my voice. If I say something over the phone, she’s thinking Daddy’s home. I say her name and she looks up for me. But this signal is preventing me from talking to her.”People facing imminent removal from the UK are entitled to notice periods ranging from three to five days during which it is, by law, vital that they are able to access legal advice and assistance, for example to assess the merits of challenging their removal.Windrush victims given additional two years to apply for compensation‘Home Office is destroying their lives’: Father-of-two to be deportedGovernment told to review deportations days before charter flightBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, which has launched a legal challenge against the Home Office over its alleged failure to provide effective access to legal advice to detainees, said: “An eleventh-hour issuing of sim cards may not be sufficient for those seeking to challenge their removal on Tuesday’s flight. Not to mention the impact on those that have been removed while the signal has been down.\u0026nbsp“This is a partial victory for access to justice but there are many unanswered questions and our legal challenge will proceed.”It comes after a\u0026nbspleaked draft of the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspLessons Learned\u0026nbspreview stated that ministers should consider ending the practice of deporting people who arrived in the UK as children, prompting calls for the Home Office to put\u0026nbspdeportation flight on hold until the review is published.The Home Office has been approached for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it saddened us all because it felt like this incredible human being would go on for ever.He headed the Douglas dynasty with a zest for le that put the rest of us to shame and was one of our final links to Hollywood’s golden age.Long before actors ostentatiously wore their hearts on their sleeves and made self-aggrandising speeches about the latest trendy cause, Kirk determinedly set out to do the right thing, regardless of any impact on his career.In the Fties, at the height of the Cold War, he stood up to a paranoid US government that considered anyone to the left of Genghis Khan a Soviet sympathiser.The McCarthy witchhunts ruined careers and wrecked lives, but Kirk dug in his heels and hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo to work on Spartacus, which would become Kirk’s most famous movie.That took balls of steel.Kirk gave millions to charity and was a US Goodwill Ambassador, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Jimmy Carter in .He experienced heartache with the death of his son Eric from an overdose and the jailing of grandson Cameron for drug offences.But even a near-fatal helicopter crash and a stroke couldn’t defeat Kirk.His son Michael — a superstar in his own right, of course — told me last year his dad worked out almost every day with a personal trainer and remained as sharp as a tack, keeping the whole extended family on their toes.I was lucky enough to interview Kirk back in my days with TV-am.The Beeb would fly them over from LA and put them up in a posh hotel.All we could offer was a hearty breakfast, plus the chance to talk about themselves and their new project for as long as they liked.There were no pesky managers and PRs to go through.Bette Davis, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall and Sammy Davis Jnr all popped into our studio at the crack of sparrows, staying for the duration of the show.Kirk was here in , promoting Dance With The Devil, a racy novel that bore a passing resemblance to his extraordinary le story.After his Jewish parents escaped persecution in Russia, Kirk was born and raised in a poor area of New York.It is a real rags-to-riches tale. His dad actually worked as a rag-and-bone man.Kirk never forgot where he came from, which is perhaps why he became a champion for justice and a fairer society.He was a delight that morning and even laughed when the crew declared, “I’m Spartacus”, one after another in his honour — though he must have seen it done hundreds of times before.He was a also a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.The Douglas clan will be in mourning but they can celebrate a le well lived.This weekend, I am on a Kirk Douglas marathon, starting with Paths Of Glory, before The Bad And The Beautul, Ace In The Hole, The Vikings, Lust For Le and, of course, Spartacus.Tomorrow’s Oscars will rightly honour him. We won’t see his like again.I WAS honoured to host The Millies this week.It is a wonderful event run by The Sun to salute our Armed Forces and give us all a chance to say a huge thank you.As always, there were astonishing stories of bravery, courage and self-sacrice.And as always, our lovely winners told me they were nothing special, just doing their job.I honestly don’t think they realise just how remarkable they are, or how much we owe them.One of my highlights was seeing -year-old Private Fin Doherty collect his award for inspiring others.Fin was just six when his paratrooper big brother JJ was killed in action in Afghanistan.Fin was determined to follow in JJ’s footsteps to honour his brother’s memory, and join the Parachute Regiment.He has been an outstanding addition and, in an emotional ceremony, was presented with JJ’s beret in December.Their mum Joyce admits she struggled with Fin’s decision to sign up, following the death of her eldest son.But she knew it was all Fin wanted – and she is so very proud of him.We honestly don’t deserve such an inspirational young man. But thank the Lord we have him on our side.NOTHING has changed. Phillip Schofield is exactly the same person he was before he felt the time was right to tell the world he’s gay.He’s still a loving father and husband and will still host his TV shows with consummate professionalism and skill.As Phillip said himself, you never know what people are struggling with every day and, for him, it was time to be honest with himself and everyone .I’m really glad that he has made the decision and very proud of him, although obviously it can’t have been easy.There’s been lots of tears, sleepless nights and a great deal of soul-searching. I hope he now finds peace of mind.He is a very lucky man to have a family and friends who love him very much and just want him to be happy.He also has a loyal fan base who love watching him on This Morning and that won’t change. Why would it Of course, he can expect a small number of bigots and homophobes to spew out hateful bile, but they are to be pitied and ignored.Those carping about why he took so long also need to shut up.People should be allowed to come out when it feels the right time for them.Phillip began his career at a time when being openly gay in a TV presenting role was just not an option.Thank goodness things have changed and he can be open now – and know that the overwhelmingly vast majority of us wish him and his family nothing but the very best.I was really touched by what he said about interviewing brave people on This Morning, and realising that he had to be just like them and tell his truth.Love comes in many dferent forms.Phillip and his we Stephanie adore each other and that won’t change. Again, why on earth would it At the end of his statement Phillip urged us all to be kind, especially to his family, and I hope we all take those words on board.Let’s wish them all the best and let them get on with their lives.WHAT a furore over a bare shoulder. Actress-turned-MP Tracy Brabin didn’t deserve the vitriol about her outfit but it WAS distracting.It’s unfortunate because Tracy was making important points about journalists being shut out of No  briefings – a move that makes my blood run cold and threatens Press freedom. Sadly, no one was really listening.Tracy told me she had been at a music event and didn’t expect to be back in the House. She is bemused by all the fuss.How those in public le dress should not detract from their message, be it a female MP in a low-cut top or mini-skirt, or a man wearing a gaudy tie or tight trousers.Our MPs are not known for their style and rarely make headlines for their fashion sense.I am very happy for them to keep it that way.WELL, that was a rather ill-advised memo to send, reminding local councils to fly the Union Flag on February  as a “celebration” of Prince Andrew’s birthday.I had no idea this was a “thing” and that Andrew was on a list of VIPs whose birthdays are marked with a flag waving on the roof of our town halls, instead of just cake and prosecco like the rest of us.Unsurprisingly, this ludicrous edict has caused much disgruntlement.As we know, Andrew has been booted out of The Firm by his own mum after that disastrous TV interview delving into his friendship with the American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Then there is the ongoing scandal over whether or not Andrew will be interviewed by the FBI as part of its investigations into child trafficking allegations against Epstein.It is all very sordid and murky. Surely even his nearest and dearest would agree this is not the time for official celebrations.He is no longer a working royal and has no place on that list.Time to lower the flags for good. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I can’t be sure, as I have other things to think about like: I need some new trousers.Then out of the blue she announced on social media that she was going to speak out because “mine and my families le is no longer up for entertainment or gossip”.“Wow,” I thought. “That’s amazing. She doesn’t know how to use apostrophes.”It turns out, however, that while she can’t write properly, she can at least think straight because she never did speak out. Which means she stopped the story from rearing up again.If only Prince Andrew was as bright. We were all dimly aware that he knew a man in America who’d had lots of sex with young girls.And that one day, this man had been found dead in a police cell. Then we went back to wonderingwe needed more washing-up liquid.Prince Andrew, however, decided that instead of letting the story die down by not saying anything, he’d go on television to set the record straight.It was a disaster. He was suddenly front-page news all over the world and he looked guilty as hell.Of what, we weren’t sure. But whatever it was, we all worked out that as he has a Bentley, he could definitely have got from a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking to the centre of London in less than six hours.A few weeks later, as the story was withering once more, Hank J Dieselburger, an American prosecutor involved in the dead sex-man’s case, announced that the FBI had received “zero co-operation” from Prince Andrew.You’d think Andrew would have learned from his earlier mistake. You’d think he’d do a Flack and say nothing.But no. The very next day, “friends” of the Prince — which is another way of saying “the Prince” — went on the attack, telling reporters he was angry and bewildered. “They haven’t even approached me — I mean him.”The problem is that ego-fed celebrities read every single thing that is written about them. And they believe everyone  is reading everything, as well.We aren’t. We don’t really care. So when you attempt to clear your name, it’s like trying to put out a fire with petrol.It’s better for Andrew, and the whole Royal Family,he takes a leaf from singer Ronan Keating’s book — “You say it best, when you say nothing atThen, perhaps, he could take a leaf from his nephew’s book. And bugger off to Canada.I’M not defending drugs here, but when you see someone giggling their way through a packet of frozen peas and some leftover sherry trle at five in the morning, it’s easy to see why someone might think: “Yes, that cannabis malarkey looks like fun. I shall give it a go.”It’s the same story with cocaine.You see a dullard finding himself absolutely fascinating at a party and you think: “I’ll have a crack at that.”But this new drug, flakka, is dferent.One man who took it ate a homeless man’s face. Another gouged her own mother’s eyes out. And a third cut off his own penis.Which raises an interesting point. Why would anyone look at someone cutting off his old fella and think, “Ooh, I’ll have what he’s having ”A BUNCH of people who think the Lake District should only be used by ramblers decided to stage a protest over plans to put ten small tourist yachts on Grasmere lake.However, before the protest could take place, the idea was abandoned. And guess what  Yup. The protest went ahead anyway.They were actually protesting about something that wasn’t going to happen. Which proves what I’ve suspected for quite some time. Ramblers aren’t entirely right in the head.Next week, they will be protesting about the sonic booms made by Concorde and the burning of witches.LAST Sunday, driving was banned in the Italian city of Milan.Who thought that was a good idea  Getting an Italian to leave his car at home is impossible. It’s a part of his being, like his liver and his lungs.Needless to say, the scheme was not very successful.So not very successful in fact that, in the first three hours, the police had issued  fines. And the authorities now admit the ban was “largely ignored”.THERE’S much talk at the moment about how internet shopping is killing the High Street. But I’m not one of the murderers.When the time comes for my annual clothes shopping trip, I simply head to the Levi’s store on Regent Street in London, point at the label on the back of the jeans I’m wearing and ask for three more pairs just the same.I love Levi’s. I’ve worn nothing  since I was  and I’ve always loved their shop, the staff have always been brilliant. They always have what I need in stock and they never ask for my phone number or email address. I’m in and out in two minutes flat.This year, though, there was a disaster. There were two disinterested youths in there who looked at the label on the back of my jeans and said, “We don’t make those any more.”WHAT  ! !On the verge of fainting with shock, I dragged them back from their interesting conversation about Stormzy and was told in an exasperated fashion that I could still buy them online.This begs a question. What’s the point of having an expensive-to-run shopyou then fill it with people who tell you to go home and buy what you need on the net PETA, an organisation for animal enthusiasts who like to wear clothes made from crude oil, have announced that people often see their pet dog as nothing more than a cheap burglar alarm.Cheap You can buy a home alarm kit these days for less than £, whereas a proper dog is going to be way more than that.Plus, you only need feed an alarm with a tiny amount of electricity to keep it running, whereas a dog requires a bed, a blanket, food, water and, later on, vets bills that will make your eyes water.THIS week, a car crashed through my fence, turning it and an expensive new gate into matchsticks.By the time I got there, the car was gone. But there was still a lot of “police aware” tape fluttering about in the breeze.So I called the nearest station, which was approximately  miles away, as I needed to contact the driver to talk about insurance. Sadly, however, while the police are “aware” of the incident, they are not prepared to give me any details.Mustn’t grumble, though. While it will cost a few hundred quid to get everything mended, I must accept that the police have much more important things to do, such as investigating dead people who weren’t paedophiles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailYour wedding is meant to be the happiest day of your le and one you will remember forever, but planning it is often memorable for all the wrong reasons – the stress. But for those fortunate enough to employ a wedding planner, Sarah Haywood is at the top of the list. ‘I run one of the world’s most luxurious wedding planning businesses,’ she tells us. ‘I can meet the demands of any client and our parties are far from your standard events.’ She pauses. ‘They are full-scale productions.’ For the past two decades, Sarah’s services have been limited to some of the world’s richest families, but now a new TV show, The Wedding Fixer, will see her use her expertise to help six very dferent couples plan their dream day.‘It was lovely to assist people who were more like me,’ she says with a smile. ‘They had good budgets, though – from £, to £, – but I started out on my landing, running a one-woman show. Now it’s huge. aposSo to go back to that intimacy and work with ordinary people was lovely. It reminded me what weddings are all about.’ Becoming a prestigious planner is no mean feat, but Sarah fell into it almost by accident. When working as a TV journalist, she was asked to plan a bash for her team.‘It was the tenth anniversary of the company I worked for and I was enlisted to organise the party. And it was really good.  aposPeople still talk about it now. I really enjoyed it and started helping friends with their events, but I never wanted to do weddings, I thought they’d be too stressful – and I was right!’ she adds with a laugh. Word got around and her first client came to her with a budget of £, to use on their perfect wedding day. ‘My job in TV had so many transferable skills,’ she recalls. ‘We have budgets, running orders, we have to problem-solveanything goes wrong and we need to be creative.apos aposThe main thing I realised quickly is that the budget is irrelevant when it comes to couples being stressed. But often people offer financial help and those who are offering money feel they have a right to make decisions and have a say in it all. So a lot of people get involved.apos aposThe way to stay calm isn’t to throw more money around. You’re doing something you’ve never done before, which is supposed to be the best day of your le. It’s going to feel stressful,’ she explains. Sarah has her own straight-talking way of soothing her clients.  ‘I tell them they’re putting their lives under a microscope, so of course they’re apprehensive. The best way is to take a step back and realise that the event element is just a backdrop to something more important.apos aposPlus, from my experience, I know thatguests are watered and well fed, they’re happy. No one has ever said, “Wow, I had such a great time at that wedding because the flowers looked great.”aposaposIt’s the feeling of intimacy that guests enjoy. No one wants to look at a £k flower display while eating a lukewarm chicken dinner. Prioritise what matters.’ We’ve become familiar with the terms Bridezilla and Groomzilla in recent years, but this wedding planner refuses to ever mutter those words. ‘Of course people are going to be controlling of their own wedding day,’ she exclaims. ‘Not wanting to let go of tasks is identiable! But that’s where I come in. Who wants to get up at am on their own wedding day to arrange flowers  Pay someone  to do it so you can just turn up.’ Start small, aim big As Sarah’s business grew, she secured a few big-budget clients. Noticing a gap in the market, she decided to pursue the higher end of the spectrum, where she now works with billionaires and Saudi princesses.  ‘Once I’d had my first client with £m to spend, I realised how much I loved making huge spectacles.apos aposWhen I started out, wedding planners weren’t really a thing in the UK,’ she tells us. ‘So, I was lucky. I conducted some research and realised most of the higher-budget clients lived overseas, but had second properties in London. It was also rated the favourite city in the world by the most wealthy sector. So I thought, “Right,someone wants to travel from overseas to have their wedding in the UK, they can plan it with me!”’ She laughs. ‘The British are seen as having a serious sense of style, and we do. Nobody does it like us,’ she says.  Sarah has a permanent team and core staff and employs externally when required, often having up to  staff for one day. She refuses to reveal how much her services cost, but made a reported profit of £m last year alone. And the bigger the budget, the more spectacular the requests. ‘I will never call a request outrageous,’ explains Sarah matter-of-factly. ‘We can make anything happen. If you’ve got money, anything can be possible.’ But what kinds of things does she manage to conjure up  ‘People have wanted pop stars such as John Legend to sing their first dance song. That can be done. We’ve booked Michael Bublé, J-Lo, Chris Martin and the magician Dynamo. Or maybe they want an empty space in a room to be turned into an orangery or a skyline scene. We can do it.’ We imagine the prices to get an A-list celebrity at your wedding are extortionate. And we’re right.‘If they’re in performance mode on a tour it might be slightly less,’ she tells us. ‘Butyou want a famous performer while they’re taking a break, you could be looking at millions. Either way, you’re looking at the top end of hundreds of thousands for a small set.’ Worldwide wedded bliss Planning high-end weddings with clients from all over the globe means that having an understanding of dferent cultures has been key for Sarah and her team.‘I’ve planned gay weddings and a quick turnaround celebration for a Saudi Princess where I had  days. Plus blended ceremonies, such as a Bangladeshi bride and an Essex groom, and Chinese weddings where it is crucial to please the parents,’ she says. ‘Many cultures have weddings that are business events, where important people are invited by parents who have never even met the couple. If they’re not invited, it would be considered very rude.apos aposIn the Middle East they have segregated weddings, where the men celebrate separately to the women, then the men come and get the women at the end,’ she tells us. ‘And they’re really fun events. Those ladies dance like nothing I’ve ever seen!’ Having orchestrated thousands of weddings, Sarah is wary to pick a favourite event, so as not to offend anyone, but explains that every day is memorable in its own way. ‘I’ve hosted a surprise wedding in a crematorium, which was fun,’ she tells us. ‘But no matter the budget, they’re all special. In fact, on The Wedding Fixer , I saw the most beautul ceremony ever. A couple called Fanny and Thomas. It had so much heart.aposaposThey wrote their own vows, the bride’s community choir sang, she walked herself down the aisle and it was so heartfelt, all on one of the smallest budgets of the series.’ Of course, the queen of all wedding ceremonies knew how to throw a brilliant bash for her own big day. But  years ago when she tied the knot with husband Tim, theirs was a more low-key affair.

But her le was not always this glamorous. At one time in her le, she was forced to work three jobs to balance the books.Her le changed after she was discovered by a modelling agency when she posted a few swimsuit pictures on Instagram, Liverpool Echo reports.Ruby said: Before modelling I was working three jobs to keep me afloat, I worked in a hotel, restaurant and a burger van. I was always interested in fashion and since I was a baby everyone was always telling me to model, but nerves always kicked in.She described how the Instagram pictures came about: My friend had just started a swimsuit business and asked as a favourI would pose in some of his swimsuits on Southport beach.After the shoot, I posted a couple of pictures on my Instagram, I’d never really put body shots on there before. Nemesis modelling agency spotted the photos and approached me. My mum was so excited but I just didn’t think anything was going to come from it. Her modelling career took off afterwards. She said: Iaposm not really sure why but I just kept on getting booked. When I was first modelling I didn’t know what I was doing so I kept on really over-thinking everything.  But working with big brands taught me lots, I learnt on the job and I now know how to do it. Speaking about her travels, she said: In December, I went to Dubai for two weeks and worked for an e-commerce company, which was amazing. And then last summer I went over to Miami and signed to an agency. Iaposm going to be going back out there again for a couple of months this year. I thought I’d be more nervous about travelling alone and doing this but I’m quite confident to be honest. Modelling has just slotted into my le.   She continued: I’ve bought myself some nice shoes and I’ve paid for my mum and dad to go to New York. I’ve also been on a couple of holidays as well. Now I’ve started earning this money I like to use it on others and treat everyone around me. She said: People have been really supportive. People who haven’t even talked to me in years, like people from school see me on JD and Boohoo and take a picture or send me pictures of the outfits I’ve modelled in.

The UK patient who arrived in France from Singapore on January  had been attending a business conference at a £,-a-night hotel in the Asian country. The gathering at the luxury-laced Grand Hyatt comprised more than  people and has been linked to the spread of coronavirus in at least three other states. On histo Britain, the man suffered flu-like symptoms and took himself to the Accident  Emergency ward at the Royal Sussex in Brighton on Sunday, February . The victim was then rushed to a specialist infectious diseases unit at Guyaposs Hospital in London on Friday, where he will remain in isolation for at least two weeks. Coronavirus has a -day incubation period where a patient may not display symptoms but can still infect others by coughs and sneezes. Since it spawned in Wuhan, China, late last year, the virus has infected , worldwide and has killed  people.  Contamines-Montjoie, a village ski resort attached to a nature reserve, is connected to Evasion Mont-Blanc. Two apartments in a ski chalet are being examined, while a crisis centre has been set up at the town hall in Contamines-Montjoie. Marie-Charlotte Pasquier, the village’s director of services, said: Information is being handed out advising people how to avoid transmission. Local doctors have also received new supplies of medicines and masks to help deal with the situation. Agnès Buzyn, France’s health minister, said the unnamed patients in France were in a aposstable conditionapos and they were being monitored constantly. Their clinical condition shows no sign of seriousness, said the minister, who added that the French authorities were trying to contact family of the British nationals. Ms Buzyn said the group of newly-infected people with the virus formed aposa cluster, a grouping around one original caseapos.  She said: That original case was brought to our attention last night. He is a British national who had ed from Singapore where he had stayed between January  and , and he arrived in France on January  for four days. Singaporeaposs use as a transport hub in south-east Asia means it could be a contaminating zone for the virus. On Sunday,  French people are to be repatriated from China, where more than  people have been killed by the virus, and , cases have been detected. The first cases of coronavirus arrived in France at the end of January, among ill people recently arrived from China.

In the UK, three million people say they are under strain in their relationships, according to Relate. And a third of married men and women who split say the reason for their orce was just “growing apart”. According to a UCL study, the most common reason for a marriage breaking down is the couple having problems with ­communication. But according to French love guru Fred Sirieix, the charming maitre d’ in Channel ’s First Dates, there are plenty of ways you can keep a long-term ­relationship on track. Fred gives Sunday Mirror readers some tips on how to maintain the spark: Go out every week At the beginning of a relationship, dates are the norm. But going out all the time is not sustainable, and eventually you’ve swapped swanky restaurants for nights on the sofa. But Fred says one night each week should be a dedicated “date night”. He says: “Having a date night a week is always a good idea – whether it’s going out for something to eat or just popping out to the pub for a pint, going to a restaurant or even going for a stroll. “Finding some ‘us’ time once a week, away from all the stresses of le, is vital.”  Be thoughtful Fred says an important way to keep that romantic connection in your relationship is to surprise your partner. “I just bought some flowers for my own partner,” he says.“I put them on Instagram and captioned them that they were flowers for her, so she saw them once on social media and then when she got home.“When she saw them, she called me straightaway – she got the pleasure twice!” He saysyou do little things like that, you are likely to get the magic back.  Move firstFred says he feels one of the main mistakes we make in relationships is waiting for the other person to make thefirst move or take responsibilitysomething is going wrong.He suggests that being the first to communicate a problem, along with a suggested solution, is best for both parties. “It’s about responsibility – and making the first step,” he says. “Show that you care, show you love them. Give it first and give it with generosity.” "},{"url":null,"title":"harvester staff share top nine","story":"NewsHarvester staff share top nine secrets - including why you should avoid the saucesHarvester staff have shed light on what le is like to work at the popular restaurant chain and offered some helpful tips on how to make the most of your dining experienceShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  FEB NewsHarvester staff have offered some insights into working at the restaurant \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe best pal who once defended mass murderer Jeremy Bamber to the hilt has turned his back on him – and rubbished his new alibi. Brett Collins broke his silence for the first time in over three decades to tell why he thinks Bamber, who slaughtered his family at their sprawling Essex farmhouse in , should never be released from jail. In the years since, Brett has gone from believing in Bamber’s innocence – even getting a lawyer to defend him – to being convinced of his guilt. And describing his one-time closest friend as “a Jekyll and Hyde personality”, he said: “He should never be released from jail. He has a dark side and a nasty streak.” Brett, now  and back living in his native New Zealand where the Sunday People tracked him down on an island, spoke out on the case after hearing that Bamber was planning a new appeal against his conviction. Bamber, now , is serving le for shooting five members of his family, a crime which forms the basis of current ITV drama White House Farm. His legal team are mounting an appeal based in part on claims the real killer was inside the house and a rle was seen at a window while he was outside talking to police. But Brett today demolishes the idea that Bamber can prove he has an alibi which means he could not have been responsible for the massacre. He insisted: “He didn’t ever bring up someone being inside or being seen at the window when the police were there with him to me. It’s just bulls**t.” Describing the events of the time, he recalled: “I got a lawyer to represent Jeremy at his court case and at that stage I believed in him.  But as time has gone by, and I’ve had a lot of time to think about things, I’ve totally changed my mind. “I remember saying to him at the time, ‘You’re going to need an alibi – they might put this thing on you’. He said to me, ‘Oh, I have it. I was at home’. I said to him, ‘That doesn’t sound like much of an alibi’. “Jeremy should stop this appeal, stop stirring things up and leave people alone. He should never be released from jail.” Speaking from his cell in Wakefield jail last month Bamber said: “It is the ultimate alibi that I was in the company of dozens of police officers when it was clear that a person or persons were alive in the house who I am convicted of murdering.”  He claims his schizophrenic sister Sheila, a model known as Bambi, murdered their -year-old parents Nevill and June and her twin sons Nicholas and Daniel, six, at the house in rural Tolleshunt D’Arcy. Brett said he remembered asking Bamber immediately after the mass slaying what had been “going on” within the family. He said,‘You wouldn’t believe what went on’, but he would go no further. That was the same answer he gave me every time I asked him. “The idea that his sister would shoot the family, put the silencer away in the cupboard, and then shoot herself is just crazy.” Brett’s new testimony comes as the murders are being portrayed in the six-part TV drama White House Farm, which finishes this Wednesday. It stars Freddie Fox as Bamber and Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones as Brett.  Brett recalled how Bamber displayed no real grief over the deaths of his family, laughed at their funeral, and could not wait to blow his inheritance on women, cars and parties. He said: “At the funeral Jeremy wasn’t depressed or really down. He was making jokes and was almost theatrical. “After the murders he asked me to go to the farm with him and help him take all the valuable stuff he had picked out to go to the auctions in London. “He literally rled through the house in every hidden spot grabbing handfuls of cash. “I said, ‘Oh my God, they’re barely dead’ and he said, ‘It’s mine, I’ve got to do it sometime’. “After the funeral we were staying at what used to be his sister’s apartment in Hampstead. “There were loads of photographers and journalists outside the front door waiting for him.  He said to me, ‘Because you’ve stood by me and helped me, I’ll shout us a trip to the south of France’. “We had a wonderful two weeks and he was in the highest of humour. “You’d never think he’d been through a funeral at all. He was just full of le and looking forward to his new le with money. “That was when I first began to wonderhe’d done it, but I put it to the back of my mind. “He was constantly speaking about the inheritance he was going to get and how he’d be able to buy whatever he wanted. “He said he wanted to buy a Ferrari or Porsche and put the farm on the market as soon as possible and live as a playboy in London.” Brett added that Bamber repeatedly had wild sex with a married woman from Switzerland they had met in the expensive ski resort of St Tropez.  He said: “We went to a private beach you had to pay to get into. There was music and champagne. “An older lady sent two bottles over to us and when Jeremy went to the toilet she came over to me and saidI could get him to sleep with her she would buy us both a beautul dinner. “This went on for a week with Jeremy sleeping with this woman. She took us to the most expensive restaurants in St Tropez and some amazing nightclubs. “It made my holiday but apparently she was like a mountain lion in bed as she kept scratching all his back like you wouldn’t believe. She was married and about ten years older, but had the body of an -year-old.”  The pair were arrested at Dover when they ed from the south of France and Brett had to prove by his passport stamps he had been on holiday in Greece at the time of the murders, so could not be involved. He stood by his friend and was photographed around that time with Angela Greaves, who was reported to be Bamber’s girlfriend. He remembered: “Jeremy spoke amazingly and had a presence but he’s a Jekyll and Hyde personality. “It was like he could turn tears and sadness on when other people like the police were around, but when he was with me he was completely normal. Andhe’s in a corner he becomes lethal.”  Brett, who lives on the island of Waiheke near Auckland, first met Bamber when he went out to New Zealand to do a ing course. The pair kept in touch and resumed their friendship when Brett visited England. He recalled his surprise at finding out that Bamber, who was adopted after being born into a family of Buckingham Palace servants, hated his loving family. He said: “He told me that in his early teens he had been raped by an older man and I think that screwed him up a bit. “When I first came to England I met his father and he took us fishing. “We spent the day together but Jeremy told me he’d never really liked his father that much and he didn’t like his mother at all.  I’ve still got a very clear memory of everything that happened and I’m now sure he staged it all on the day of the murders. “He had quite a devious mind and used to love the cut and thrust of making up stuff. He had a love and greed for money. Anyone who knew him close like I did knew that money was the number one thing in his le. It wasn’t normal.

Kate has even said in the past that other members of the Royal Family mock her for the amount of time she spends on walk-abouts, always wanting to speak to as many people as possible. But her kindness and effort during visits has earned her a sweet new nickname - and itaposs inspired by her mother-in-law Princess Diana. William and Harryaposs mum was often referred to as the Peopleaposs Princess because of her unprecedented connection with members of the public, as well as her fearless charity work. Fans have noticed similar traits in Kate, and have started to call her the Childrenaposs Princess on social media because of her way with her younger fans. Commenting on a video of Kate posted to mark her landmark Five Questions survey, people were quick to suggest the new title. One wrote: Childrenaposs Princess! Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge and our future Queen! Another commented: Duchess Catherine truly is a Childrenaposs Princess. Well done everyone whoaposs involved in this great project!!  A third replied: Beautul princess Kate, excellent job, wonderful Duchess and Childrenaposs Princess.

The Duchess got into a rather awkward exchange with a three-year-old fan who didnapost approve of her outfit choice, claiming she didnapost look like Cinderalla. Kate met Rhian Costello and her daughter Annabel - who was very excited to meet a real princess.  But was left a tad disappointed as Kate wasnapost wearing a Disney-inspired dress, and Kate ended up apologising to her.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs she chatted to A-listers and schmoozed with stars at the Baftas, the Duchess of Cambridge showed she was the ultimate rockstar royal. Despite weeks of turmoil following Harry and Meghan’s shock decision to swap the UK for Canada, Kate, , looked happier and more relaxed in her regal duties than ever. Wearing a recycled white and gold gown by Alexander McQueen, the mum-of-three gossiped and giggled with Judy actress Renée Zellweger – even patting the star’s arm affectionately. Kate also met  director Sam Mendes, while husband Prince William, , mingled with Hollywood heavyweights including Joker star Joaquin Phoenix. According to body language expert Judi James, Kate’s appearance at the glitzy event marks a dramatic new direction for the Duchess. Judi says: “It has been a perfect storm for the Royal Family lately but Kate has now taken on the biggest power position in the entire Firm. “She’s the new matriarch because while the Queen is strong, she’s getting older and needs that kind of support from someone she can trust.” Kate has come a long way from the shy, -year-old student who first caught William’s eye during a university fashion show in . Since marrying in to the Royal Family in April , Kate has often seemed uncomfortable in the glare of the public eye.  “In the early days, she would hide herself in William’s shadow, but it was clear from her appearance at the Baftas that all of that has totally changed,” says Judi. “She’s not remotely dependent on him any more.” However, Judi thinks that Kate’s newfound confidence has had a positive impact on Wills, too. “Seeing them hold court with superstars, it was obvious they have shted into real power couple mode. “It’s ironic, as that’s the path Harry and Meghan were meant to take, but Kate looks incredibly at ease in this new role.  The drama surrounding ‘Megxit’ – which saw Harry, , and Meghan, , controversially renounce their official duties – appears to have been the defining moment in Kate’s rise to the top of the Windsor tree.Judi says: “She’s been supporting William and acting as a mediatorduring all the recent arguments. “By playing out these complicated roles so perfectly, she has provedherself to be the royals’ big saviour.”Royal expert and author Ingrid Seward believes that the Queen, , is hugely grateful to Kate for stepping up. “She’s delighted with her,” she says.  “The Queen is very reliant on Kate because she’s so stable – and she’s simply untouchable in everything she does at the moment.” Although Ingrid does not believe Kate ever felt threatened by Meghan joining the family, she adds: “The recent fall-out between Harry and William would have been draining for her, so she’s probably feeling a huge weight off her shoulders that she doesn’t have to worry about Meghan’s influence any more.” Kate’s priorities may also be changing now that her and William’s children – George, six, Charlotte, four, and Louis, two in April – are becoming slightly more independent. “Charlotte and George are at school now, so she has more time on her hands,” Ingrid says.  “That means she can do more of what she really enjoys – and we saw that with the garden she designed at last year’s Cha Flower Show. “In earlier years, she always had to toe the line. Now she can pursue her own interests more freely.”  Kate’s popularity with the British public seems to have rebooted her sense of style, too. Ingrid says: “She used to be so careful, wearing little dresses and nude heels with everything, but she’s much less mumsy these days.

Boyfriend Liston Dove had gone round to mum-of-three Lisa Bushell’s to do the washing as their machine was broken. But he came home grubby ­having slept with Lisa. The double betrayal devastated Sarah, , who said: “It broke me. I wouldn’t expect that from a friend, let alone my sister. “The two people I trusted most in the world had betrayed me in the worst way possible. “I was furious with Liston. I’m not an aggressive person but I felt like going to his work and beating the c**p out of him.” “I couldn’t believe Lisa would do that to me. When she split up with her husband I’d done everything I could for her, looking after her three children and making sure she was OK. “She’d repaid me – by sleeping with my boyfriend.” Such an appalling deception would often be the death knell for a relationship. But, amazingly, Sarah has buried the hatchet with supermarket worker Liston, , and Lisa, . Now Sarah and Liston have ten-month-old son Zack together. She said: “I’ve forgiven them but I don’t think I’ll ever forget.” Liston was Sarah’s first crush when she met him at her mum Shirley’s wedding. She was  and he was . He had a girlfriend and they lost touch until  when they bumped into other in a bar. Sarah said: “It was very romantic. We recognised each other straight off and had a great night together before I dropped him off in the taxi on the way home. “He called me a few days later and askedI wanted to go for a walk on the beach together. More dates followed and we fell in love. “Liston was always telling me I was the women he was going to marry, but I was quite cautious as I had a two-year-old daughter from my previous relationship.” A few months later they moved in together. They were desperate for a child to cement their love but, after a year of trying, Sarah was still unable to conceive. She said: “We were seeing a specialist but there didn’t seem to be any reason why I couldn’t get ­pregnant. We weren’t arguing about it but it did put us under a lot of pressure.”  Meanwhile Lisa’s marriage had broken down and she was struggling alone with three young kids. The sisters were very close and always helping each other. So when Sarah’s washing machine broke down in February , she asked Liston to take a load to Lisa’s house to get it laundered. But Sarah smelled a rat the ­moment he ed. She said: “I just had this funny feeling something had gone on. I had a weird suspicion but I can’t explain why. I sensed there was ­something dferent when we were all together but couldn’t quite put my finger on it.” Still plagued with doubts two months later, Sarah turned to her best pal Emma, Liston’s sister. Initially Emma was sure nothing had happened between Liston and Lisa. But then Emma changed her mind. A few days later, Emma called Lisa on her mobile as Sarah ­listened on a speaker phone. And her heart broke in two as her sister confessed all. Sarah said: “It was like a bad dream. Lisa was upset saying it was a mistake and she didn’t want me to know as she didn’t want to hurt me. I couldn’t listen to any more and ran out the room.”  Sarah texted Liston: “I know everything. Don’t ever contact me again.” That night, Emma took her to the pub where she got “way too drunk” and just sat in the corner upset. Numb with shock, Sarah felt unable to confront either Lisa or Liston who, by now, was continually texting and calling, begging for forgiveness. Sarah said: “I still loved and missed him, but I also hated him.” She kept Liston at armsfor four months but her daughter Amelia, from a previous relationship, kept asking to see him. In the end Sarah caved in. She said: “When he first started coming round I couldn’t even look at him. :I’d just disappear to another room while he played games with Amelia. I was so angry. I was ­really down and ended up on antidepressants. “Liston kept askinghe could take me out to apologise properly but I was still furious. About five weeks later I gave in and went for a meal with him and we spoke about what happened. He said he was sorry and that he would do ­anything to have me back. “I realised how much I missed him. He had been my best friend, my rock, but too much water had gone under the bridge.” Liston finally won over Sarah when he bought her tickets to the Download festival in Doncaster, South Yorks.  She said: “He was really apologetic and said he didn’t know why it had happened and that he wasn’t even attracted to Lisa. “He said his biggest regret in le was losing me and, being miles away from home at the festival, changed something in me. I could see that I had to take him back.” But Sarah, of Norris Green, Liverpool, still hadn’t confronted sister Lisa. “I just couldn’t face it. I told my mum to tell Lisa to steer clear of me. Our kids were at the same school but thankfully used dferent entrances so I could avoid her.” Sarah had nothing to do with Lisa until September  when their mum Shirley engineered a meeting on the school playground. Lisa has apologised for her “massive mistake” but Sarah doesn’t think it will ever be the same again between them. Liston said: “I’m as mortied as anybody could be and I’m so happy that Sarah has forgiven me.

From the outside, the home looks like a standard terrace house - although it certainly stands out with its bright orange finish and baby blue doors and windows. But hiding behind its tiny facade is a six-bedroom family home and a rear that leads to a pebbled beach. The house, called Glenrosa, is situated on the Ceredigion coastline in the village of Borth, Wales - a short walk to the shops, pubs and restaurants. The view of Borth Beach and the Cardigan Bay coastline beyond makes the patio a great place for summer al fresco dining. Inside the home are three floors, with the extra floor created by utilising the loft space. Much of the interior of this home is designed with the seaside in mind. There are the whitewashed boardwalk style tiles in the shower room, the mini surfboards and le buoys on the bedrooms walls and sea landscape artwork. The ground floor offers a cosy living room that looks out to the street. There is an exposed brick fireplace with a log burner and stripped wood flooring. The room next to this is the dining room that can sit eight people in front of the exposed stone chimney fireplace. Also on the ground floor is the kitchen which leads to the back garden and offers sweeping views of the beach and sea. Imagine cooking Sunday lunch with the sound of the waves wafting in. The first floor room at the back of the house is the room with the best sea view. Originally built as a bedroom, the current owners have turned this into a lounge. They have added a large picture window that juts out so people can sit right by the window and watch the sea for hours. The master suite is on the same floor. It is not the largest room in the house, but it has a sublime view of the beach. There could be potential for a new owner to maximise the sea views from the pillow by adding in a Juliet balcony.

British citizens could see changes to healthcare, driving permits and border control being made as a result - as well as ato the blue British passport, Gloucestershire Live reports. Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis has confirmed the current maroon covers are due to turn blue now that the UK is no longer a part of the European Union. The design is in fact ato the original passport colour first used back in  - and itshas been delayed while stocks of the EU-style burgundy one are used up. For a standard ten-year passport, it means they will be stuck with red until . The first wave of blue passports will start being sent out by the end of March, but there is no guarantee which colour will be issued. A Home Office spokesman said: “There will be a mixture of blue and burgundy passports issued over a period of months, and we expect all new passports to be blue by the middle of the year. “As well as using up the existing stock of burgundy passports, the printing presses all need to be tweaked to make blue covers, which needs to be done in stages, otherwise the printing process would grind to a halt.”  The blue passports changed colour once the UK joined the EU and the burgundy shade was agreed upon and adopted soon after. The new passport is due to have up-to-date security features and technologies to protect against fraud and forgery - but the pages will be plastic instead of paper, making it more dficult to alter. Those who prefer the burgundy shade will not lose out - these passports will continue to be issued but without reference to the EU. They are due to be phased in over  andyou renew your passport in the next few months you could receive it in either colour.

What they didnapost know, what that Lucy had a disease called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, a serious medical condition caused by inflammation of the brain. The inflammation occurs when antibodies produced by the bodyaposs own immune system attack NMDA receptors in the brain. Lucyaposs symptoms started getting worse.

From the outside, I looked like I was having a psychotic episode.  Lucy was sectioned under the Mental Health Act  and admitted to the Peter Hodgkinson mental health unit at Lincoln County Hospital, as staff believed she was suffering from a mental breakdown. While Lucy was in hospital, an investigation was carried out into what could have caused her apparent breakdown. Police officers poured over hundreds of personal messages to try and piece together what might have happened. Lucy likened her admittance to the ward to being put in prison. She wasnapost sure where she was, she said, and became convinced that someone was attacking her. Her condition began deteriorating, and her body started to shut down. Lucy eventually became catatonic, unable to feel her body.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email British tourists in Magaluf face being asked to sign a code of conduct document when they check into their hotels this summer - and they could be fined £, for jumping off balconies.Majorca’s hotel association is encouraging members to protect themselves by making sure tourists agree in writing to behave themselves. The move comes after the introduction of new measures designed to stamp out drunken tourism in party resorts including Magaluf in Majorca and the neighbouring island of Ibiza. Holidaymakers caught leaping off their balconies in the areas covered by the new regional government decree have been warned they could be hit with fines of up to €, . Hotels which fail in a new legal obligation to kick out guests engaging in the dangerous practice, known locally as balconing, have also been told to expect the same type of fines. The document Majorca hotel federation FEHM has drafted and sent to its member hotels in Magaluf and the German-popular party resort of S’Arenal, which is also affected by the new regulations, says: “The hotel management informs clients that it is forbidden to engage in practices which endanger le, health and physical integrity in this establishment, for example by passing from a balcony or window to another and jumping from unsuitable locations into the swimming pool.” It adds: “Guests who carry out these dangerous practices will be expelled immediately by hotel management, with the assistance of the forces of law and ordernecessary.” Holidaymakers where hotels decide to implement the change will be asked to sign and date the document and record their passport and room numbers at check-in. The code of conduct also highlights the fines that can be levied on guests who break the rules and warns them: “We also inform you that taking drinks of any kind outside the hotel is strictly prohibited.”  Maria Jose Aguilo, vice-president of the FEHM which has  member hotels in Majorca, said the association was recommending the introduction of the document but confirmed it was “optional.” She told respected local paper Ultima Hora: “The only objective here is to offer more legal protection in case of claims.” Officials at the association said today it was too early to say what the take-up by hotels would be. The new decree against drunken tourism was announced on January  and took effect following its publication in an Official State Gazette five days later. It was approved by regional MPs on Tuesday. Only far-right wing party Vox voted against ratying the decree, branding it “discriminatory” and “botched” and predicting it would lead to job losses.  The decree covers Magaluf, S’Arenal and the West End part of San Antonio in Ibiza which is also popular with British holidaymakers. It bans pub crawls and drink offers like happy hours and x in those areas. The decree, valid for five years, also limits the number of alcoholic drinks served in restaurants and hotels as part of all-inclusive offers to three at lunch and three at dinner. Party boat operators are banned from picking up and dropping off revellers in the areas the law covers. And shops in the resorts will be banned from selling alcohol between .pm and am. A regional government spokesman confirmed after its introduction: “The new rules establish a penalty regime which puts special emphasis on serious and very serious misdemeanours.  “Those practices which are dangerous and cause risk to le or endanger the integrity and health of clients or the tourists who engage in them, will be considered serious misdemeanours. “Serious misdemeanours will be dealt with by way of fines of between €,and €, .” The mayor whose remit includes Magaluf has welcomed the new decree. Alfonso Rodriguez Badal, whose council has waged a long-standing war on badly-behaved holidaymakers, described it as an “important step”, adding: “I am convicted that sooner or later these efforts will pay off.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Alloa-Dundee-United.jpg ","title":"a breather for united is just what the doctor ordered at tannadice","story":"Saturday’s defeat for Dundee United showed the players need a bit of a breather – luckily for them they’ve got one this weekend.United fans would probably want a match to go to on Saturday but a rest weekend is just what the doctor ordered for Robbie Neilson and his men.What they’ve done this season already is a massive achievement and the day was always coming closer that they’d be punished for an off-day.That happened against Arbroath at Tannadice .There had been warning signs from the Red Lichties on their previous matches there – a - draw in the Challenge Cup and then leading - going into stoppage time before losing - in the league.Their gameplan obviously was effective and they stuck with it to good effect this time around.The dference on Saturday was United didn’t have enough about them to get a result.For me, that’s most likely a sign of fatigue, and possibly a wee bit of complacency.It’s really dficult to avoid the latter, particularly when suffering from tiredness.There’s also the build up of injuries.Nicky Clark is out for the rest of the season.

Declan McDaid lofted the kick into the box for Forster to steam in and head goalwards, only to see striker Hemmings knock it in on the line.Minutes later Dario Zanatta flashed a low shot wide of Conor Hazard#s post before Hemmings got his second of the afternoon on  minutes.Shaun Byrne#s long punt up top was miscontrolled and McGowan was all over the mistake. He played in his strike partner, who brushed off the Partick defence to fire past Scott Fox.Partick came out with more le about them in the second half with Zanatta a threat but Dundee were still creating chances and went close six minutes after the restart.First, McDaid saw a low cross kicked away by goalkeeper Fox before Ross Callachan was played in but could only hit the keeper with his effort from inside the area.On the hour, Christie broke forward but took the wrong option in choosing to shoot rather than pass before Fox again beat out a dangerous McDaid cross on  minutes.On  minutes, Dundee lost Callachan as he was stretchered off injured with Nelson replacing him.With six minutes to go, Brian Graham looked to have the chance to give the Jags a leline but he handled when controlling and the chance was gone.In the closing stages the Dark Blues were happy to see the game out as they moved back to fourth spot, three points behind second-placed Inverness.Dundee: Hazard, Forster, Meekings , Berra, McDaid, Christie, Byrne , McGowan, Dorrans, Callachan , Hemmings .Subs not used: Hamilton, Field, Cameron, Strachan.Partick: Fox, Penrice, O#Ware , Brownlie, Cardle , Bannigan, Graham, Cole, Zanatta, Barjonas , O#Connor .Subs not used: Sneddon, Robson, Austin.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e32a193a66212.99925684-558x372.jpg ","title":"exclusive dundee city council worker sacked over email tampering claims","story":"A high-profile Dundee City Council education officer has been sacked over claims he sent a ‘falsied email’ during the tendering process for a £, local authority contract.Kenny Christie, education support officer for arts and culture with the council, was hauled in front of council chiefs earlier this month over claims he interfered in the tendering process to provide sound technology for Dundee Schools Musical Theatrefor three shows last summer.Mr Christie, who worked for the council for the past  years, has strenuously denied the allegations and has confirmed he will be appealing against the decision.He was previously director with DSMT but has since left the company, which is funded by the council.The allegations centre on Blue Parrot Production and Events, based in Edinburgh.It is understood Blue Parrot missed the tender deadline for the DSMT contract and, when an email from the company was forwarded to the tender team, the date had been tampered with to make it look like it had been submitted on time.But Mr Christie has denied all links to the scandal and said: “I received a letter from Dundee City Council today, January .“I can confirm that I am not currently working for Dundee City Council in any capacity.“I have been removed from my post.“The council has accused me of deliberately forwarding a falsied email. There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/02/Dundee-v-Partick-350x564.jpg ","title":"field set to make bow against jags","story":"Left-back Tom Field is set to be thrust straight into the Dundee starting line-up this weekend.The -year-old joined the Dark Blues late last Friday after news of first-choice Jordan Marshall’s injury came back worse than first feared.Scan results on the thigh injury Marshall picked up in training arrived around lunchtime on the day of the transfer deadline.That forced manager James McPake into swt action to add cover in the shape of Field, who had left boyhood club Brentford earlier that day.With the late arrival, last weekend’s clash at Greenock Morton came too soon to make his debut with Jordan McGhee playing in the unfamiliar role on the left of defence.After meeting his new team-mates and training all week, Field is now likely to make his bow in dark blue against Partick Thistle on Saturday.To give him some match action, Field took part in a bounce game at Stirling Albion on Tuesday in which Andrew Nelson and Paul McGowan also featured after missing out at Cappielow through injury.Nelson, who scored in the match, has been out since the turn of the year after surgery to fix a broken hand.After seeing Christophe Berra and Christie Elliott make their debuts at Morton with Conor Hazard making a second bow after ing on loan, Field is likely to make his first outing against the Jags.Manager James McPake said: “Tom Field trained this week.“Jordan Marshall being out is disappointing because he’s been excellent.“He will miss eight weeks at least, maybe .“It’s a problem deep in the thigh muscle so it’s dficult to know when it has healed.“Jordan is an explosive player so we have to make sure he is right with that one.”Berra, meanwhile, made his first appearance in over a month last weekend and manager James was pleased with his start to le at the club.He added: “Christophe was good.

The site was then occupied by Jamie’s Italian, which opened in February , before closing down in .Dustin Macdonald, chairman of the Aberdeen City Centre Community Council, said: “It’s disappointing to see so many units lying empty on Union Street but it becoming increasingly dficult for business owners who are up against online shopping.“There are a lot of empty units, particularly on the upper floors of Union Street, and it would be great to see that space being used.“But it is a widespread problem because businesses are up against online shopping nowadays. I do think there is an onus on business owners to try to make their building more appealing to customers.“There are grants available for business ownersthey wish to have the front of their stores done up, and I would encourage them to do so.”Under the city centre masterplan, a blueprint approved by the local authority in June , a number of objectives were set out to regenerate the city over the years to come, while conserving its heritage.Phase one of its planned projects are currently underway, which includes the rejuvenation of Aberdeen Art Gallery, which opened in November, and the pedestrianisation of Broad Street, which was finished at the start of August .Other schemes include installing suspended street signs in areas across the city centre and banning traffic on Langstane Place, Justice Mill Lane and Windmill Brae from pm to am.Phase two of the scheme is planned for years four to seven of the project and includes ersying employment space as well as developing skills and training in the services sector.The Queen Street initiative, which forms part of phase two, also hopes to deliver more than  new homes and incorporate a civic hub.In , a Union Street Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme , was launched. The five-year initiative aims to “restore the majesty” of Aberdeen’s main street, and is a £. million grant fund which is available to owners of eligible buildings to undertake high quality repairs, restoration and the refurbishment of buildings.Since its inception, it has been used to refurbish a former jewellers into a hot dog restaurant.Real Hot Dogs at  Union Street opened in August  after making use of the grant to clean up the shop front, however it closed in January last year.The scheme is currently planned to run until .Adrian Watson, chief executive of business body Aberdeen Inspired, said: “Union Street as a high street is changing and this is necessary, in a challenge that is not felt in Aberdeen alone, but across the country.“We need to think dferently about the experience we offer and of course there are still challenges here as we make this transition. Our efforts to continue revitalising Union Street are ongoing and enhancing the experience for those living and working in the city is an integral part of what we do as an organisation as we aim to drive footfall in the city centre.”Aberdeen City Council is taking an active approach to improve the city centre and has served notices on businesses deemed to “negatively impact the amenity of the area.”The owner of one business, Inspirations on Union Street which is vacant, was asked to make a string of repairs due to its condition bringing “signicant disamenity” to the area.An appeal was lodged with the Scottish Government last year which was rejected this month.Councillor Marie Boulton, the council’s lead on the city centre masterplan, said: “Union Street remains very much the heart of Aberdeen. The council is working with Historic Environment Scotland to conserve the fabric of its most important buildings by offering grants to owners.“CARS also aims to stimulate the economy by encouraging occupancy of vacant commercial units and upper floors for residential use. The council is continuing to invest in our heritage as well as events that showcase our unique streetscape.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/20200130_KEENAN_021-e1580717494534-135x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"new fundraising manager appointed at north east charity","story":"A north-east charity has appointed a new fundraising manager.Caroline Rutherford joined North East Sensory Servicesafter spending  years in the oil and gas industry.The Aberdeen University graduate resumed her studies at Robert Gordon University after the oil downturn, gaining a masters degree in project management.Now she will join Ness as a fundraising manager.The charity works to achieve independence for blind and deaf people through the delivery of information, equipment and support.Caroline said: “I’m over the moon to be working with this fantastic charity.“I look forward to using the skills and experience I have to play a part in making a real dference to people’s lives.“I wish to build on the charity’s already successful trust and foundation applications and to further relationships with corporate supporters.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e3a81c26be406.15624067-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"north east residents invited to e bike taster session","story":"Residents of a north-east town are being encouraged to get on their bikes as part of a new initiative.Aberdeenshire Council has teamed up with Ythan Cycle Club and Grampian Cycle Partnership to promote the benefits of using electric bicycles.A taster session is to be held in Gordon Park in Ellon on Saturday February .The local authority hopes encourage more people to consider cycling in order to meet objectives around sustainability and climate change.The drop-in session will include advice from CyclingUK and Sustrans, and residents will also have the chance to try out an e-bike.Those who already own e-bikes are encouraged to bring them along to share their stories with others.Chris Menzies, the council’s transportations strategy team leader, said: “With the issues around climate change high on the agenda, anything we can do to encourage a simple change in behaviour which reduces carbon emissions has to be welcomed.“Bikes might not be the answer for everyone, but e-bikes are a fantastic enabler as either a commuting option or for a quick trip to the local shop # it all makes a dference.“The cargo bike has been made available by Aberdeenshire Council to a number of businesses over the past year and has proven to be a contender for small local deliveries.”The drop-in session takes place on Saturday, February  from am until pm."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e3a81c26be406.15624067-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"winds of up 60mph set to batter north east","story":"Winds of almost mph are set to batter the north-east this weekend.The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for wind on Saturday and Sunday for the whole of the UK, with disruptions to travel to be expected.Winds of up to mph will batter north-east towns such as Peterhead, with gusts of around mph expected in other parts of the country. vw, px\"  Delays to road, rail air and ferry transport are being warned throughout the country with coastal communities and sea fronts to be affected by large waves.Some bridges and roads could be shut and potential damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs has been warned.There is also a chance of power cuts."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/ABERDEEN-DUMBARTON-763x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeens funso ojo derek mcinnes made right call to rest me","story":"Midfielder Funso Ojo insists boss Derek McInnes made the right call to rest him for the - loss to St Johnstone # as he is fully fit for the cup.In the immediate after-math of the  midweek loss to Saints McInnes admitted he gambled with some player selections with today’s Scottish Cup fth round tie against Kilmarnock in mind.Dropping summer signing Ojo to the bench was one of them.The Belgian confirmed he suffered a hamstring problem on the eve of the game but would still have been willing to play Saints.Ojo was ruled out for  weeks earlier this season after suffering tears to both hamstrings.McInnes decided to rest him and the summer signing watched from the sidelines as the under pressure Reds failed to score for a fourth successive match.He said: “I felt something the day before the St Johnstone game and woke up with it on Wednesday.“So I thought I would let the physio know and get some treatment. I am happy that the gaffer was responsible enough and looked  at the long run to pull me out of the game.#For me as a footballer I would have just said let me just go in. But that would certainly would not have been the smart decision. So I am happy he rested me.“I thinkwe had won that game no-one would have said anything about it.”Aberdeen’s season has suffered a slump since the winter break with just one goal in five matches, in a - cup defeat of League One Dumbarton.He said: “After the game the mood was down and no one was happy about the way we played and the result.“The next day you come in and we have a cup game coming where we can win a big prize for the club. So everyone turns that switch and looked forward.”Supporters booed after the loss to Saints and McInnes admitted players’s confidence has been affected by recent form.The scrutiny on McInnes and his players will increasethey exit the Scottish Cup today.He said: “The easiest way to fix that is to just get a goal. It could be a goal out of brilliant play where everyone stands on their seats and starts clapping and saying I have never seen anything like that before.“Or it could be the most ugly goal you have ever seen. Confidence is something hard to get backyou are lacking it. I don’t think there is anything you can do at home, in training – it is something that just happens.“After you get that confidence back and look back on what you have done you probably haven’t done anything dferent.

I watched the game from the sidelines on Wednesday and noticed it was quiet.“First of all that is because we don’t perform like we want to and the fans want to. There is not much people need at the moment to start mumbling when they are not happy. In the Dumbarton cup game it was dferent because there was so much support.“Even though it we only won - the performance going forward with the ball was better and we had more attacking threat.“That starts from the stands as well as the confidence comes from what I call the th man.“I don’t knowthey call the crowd the same here for the fans.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory.

The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages. The -metre yacht Cerigo arrived first at Tobermory from Crinan in  secs short of  hours.Results:-Class  Fulmar– h m s Sally of Kames– h m s Arcturus– h m sVandah m s. Helenh m s. Torridonh m s.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

The shambles surrounding two new ferries to serve Arran and the Hebrides now has the Scottish taxpayer on the hook for at least pound million, in what is merely the latest example of an embarrassing and costly public project that has run aground.Ferguson Marine, which won the contract in  and went under last year with debts of pound million before being taken into public ownership, blames the Scottish Government and CMAL, another state-owned company that owns the ferries run by CalMac. CMAL claims that Ferguson began work before agreeing final specications, and that cost overruns were its responsibility.Meanwhile, CalMac says that it never wanted dual fuel vessels, using marine diesel and liquefied natural gas , and Jim McColl, the industrialist who took on Fergusonrsquos in , says the system would never have provided a benefit.The Scottish Government stands accused of having insisted on LNG as a green gimmick, and of prematurely announcing the order to steal a march on a Tory spending commitment at Faslane, made on the same day by the then Chancellor, George Osborne.If, as the Scottish Governmentrsquos former adviser Luke van Beek suggests, there was a breakdown in communication, and that the brief for the project was dangerously vague, it can certainly be charged with having failed to provide adequate scrutiny of how public money was being spent, and to have stepped in to prevent matters becoming worse.After the fiascos at ScotRail and the hospital builds in Glasgow, Edinburgh and now Aberdeen, this is becoming a dismally familiar complaint. The latest mess ndash which holds up to ridicule both our proud shipbuilding heritage and the basic competence of Holyrood ndash is a particular embarrassment, and demands an urgent public inquiry. This, too, is a depressingly familiar call.Ministers have been far too ready to make excuses, dodge responsibility and ndash always a favoured tactic ndash accuse critics of ldquotalking Scotland down. If the SNP wishes to demonstrate that independence is a credible political option , it needs to begin operating with the basic level of competence citizens expect and deserve.The greatest service the SNP could perform for the nationalist cause is not to attempt to rerun the last referendum, nor to manufacture grievances to lob at Westminster, but to give the electorate evidence that politicians at Holyrood are capable of performing the tasks fundamental to government.That means upholding standards in public services, demonstrating responsible stewardship of the taxpayersrsquo money, ensuring infrastructure projects deliver the intended result and provide value for money and, above all, accepting that the responsibility for failure ultimately rests with ministers.Examples such as Crossrail and HS demonstrate that such failings are not unique to Scotland they are a perpetual risk in all government spending. But that is why the public is entitled to expect ministers to be vigilant against waste, delay and a failure to deliver. Scotlandrsquos record is undeniably poor.The Government at Holyrood is gaining an unfortunate reputation for expensive failures of this sort. Their apparent casual disregard for their basic duties, and for what the Scottish people have a right to expect, is a disservice to Scotland as a competent and capable nation which can attend to its own affairs. That,nothing , should alarm the SNP, since it is an indictment not only of the competence of their current administration, but of their fundamental ambition."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"DEREK Mackay isnrsquot the only Nat posting appalling material on social media.

So it proves in explaining why he, of all people, is transitioning from Robespierre to Portillo and fronting a cosy travel show. Next hersquoll be taking Sandi Toksvigrsquos spot on The Great British Bake Off.ldquoThere comes a time in every comedianrsquos career when he decides to do travelogues, said Boyle at the beginning of the half hour. ldquoIn fact, among comedians the phrase lsquogone to do traveloguesrsquo is slang for when someone dies.He had another reason to hit the road, other than working to pay the bills like the rest of us. His trip round the old country was preparation for another tour, with Boyle trying out stand-up material in small clubs before playing the big venues in Glasgow and Edinburgh. He racks up rehearsal time and a holiday, the viewer gets to find out his take on Glencoe. And what a take it was.First stop is The Stand in Glasgow, where some hapless punter had forgotten to switch his phone off when Boyle came on. This allowed the comedian to say something deeply offensive in the first five minutes of the programme. I would like to think it was a sort of early warning signal to those who might have tuned in expecting Judith Chalmers.The first part of his journey took him from Aberdeen to Oban, with stops for interviews and musings to camera along the way. He met a hermit called Jake, who turned out to be marketing a holiday home well off the beaten track in Aberdeenshire . It looked like a caravan up a tree because it was.Boyle thought it was the kind of place he would comehe was in witness protection. He and Jake got on famously. Thatrsquos the thing with Boyle: he is a pugnacious sort but a surprisingly good interviewer. Okay, you got the impression now and then that the chat was engineered so that he could crowbar in a prepared line, but by and large he listened well, and he had a gentle, softly spoken way that got the best out of people.It wouldnrsquot be Boyle, though, without some eyebrow scorching material, and his visit to Glencoe sparked a rf that linked the  massacre to Jimmy Savile, one time resident of the area. Ooft. But there was considered material too, as when Boyle and Andy Wightman MSP talked about land ownership. Fewer than  people own half the land in Scotland, eh He dropped in on the Findhorn community , and Cruachan power station, where beautully crafted wooden artworks on the wall had him reminiscing about doing the readings at Mass when he was a boy. There was a story about horses that revealed the Glaswegianrsquos deep, dark secret: hersquos a soppy bunny at heart.Boyle has done a travel show before, about Russia, but this was his first in Scotland. Like any comic who tackles Caledonia, he knows he has very big banana boots to fill. As with explaining why he was doing a travelogue, he addressed the Billy Connolly question directly.On the ferry from Oban to Mull, one of his favourite crossings, he said he watched Connollyrsquos programmes when younger and used to love the way he spoke so lyrically about the Scottish landscape.Boyle had a go himself, referring to the light and how it changes, before conceding that Connolly was one of a kind, peerless. ldquoHersquos really atypical for a Scottish man.That does Boyle, and Scottish men in general, something of a disservice. With three parts to go, I hope he has another try at finding his inner Robert Louis Stevenson. Then again, next week finds him in Edinburgh during the festivals. I expect swearing will be involved."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-hotel-boom-continues-25m-plan-gets-nod","story":"The project, which will include a -bedroom hotel with bar and roof terrace alongside retail space, will be developed on the corner of Trongate and Hutcheson Street.

History, music and crafting were of greater interest in lower and middle income groups, while sports and food were more popular in higher incomes groups. Natural heritage, theatre and drama and growing and gardening were equally popular among all income groups.The reported benefits of cultural participation include socialising and making friends, making localitiesbetter places to live and visit, increased health and wellbeing, education and learning, and building stronger local communities.Respondents from the Highlandsand Islands rated above the national average for all benefits, while people from the north east were also above average.People living in the west of the country had above average results for the role of culture in strengthening local communities, and for making better places to live and work.By contrast, residents in the south were below average for the perceived benefits, including stronger local communities, learning new skills and increased physical activity.When asked what form of cultural activity people would most like to see developed in their local area, film and TV dropped from the top spot, with greater priority given to nature and natural places, growing and gardening, and architecture and built heritagendash suggesting these were areas people would like to see better provided for in their own areas in the future.The National Trust for Scotlandsees the forthcoming culture strategyas a way for the country as a whole to increase opportunities to enjoy its culture and believes an expansive definition of culture must be adopted it to be relevant to the experience of most people.Diarmid Hearns, the Trustrsquos head of public policy, said: ldquoIn its new strategy, the Scottish Government has a real opportunity to show leadership on this, tackling the barriers we have identied and enabling participation from all in the community, across the country.ldquoOur research found Scots see many additional benefits from their cultural activities, including learning, making friends, or creating a better place tolive. But they also experienced barriers ndash and these were worse for those on lower incomes, and for those from ethnic minority groups.ldquoWe need to better understand what the opportunities are at a local level, and what the role of national and local government is in supporting culture. We also need to work together to tackle the inequalities in access to culture our research has identied.ldquoThis means looking at nationaland local cultural budgets and whether these are adequate for our ambitions. We also need to see the value of Scotlandrsquos culture recognised in other public policies, for example in planning, economic development or regenerating our towns and villages."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-vital-now-get-finance-secretary-fit-job","story":"The last incumbent was a purely political appointment with zero attributes in his CV. A lelong politician is not the right skills for this particular position.If we are to create an economy that funds our ambitions in the NHS, social care, police, infrastructure and climate change we need someone who has experience of managing the economy, not another political apparatchik.Ian McNair, Glasgow G.THE Scottish Government claims that its reason for demanding details from the Sun was to establish veracity and substance. A reality is that it had a readily accessible source of verication and substantiation in the shape of Derek Mackay.I might be a bit naiumlve but, regardless of the name and address of a -year-old, the question is whether a minister behaved inappropriately. Prior to the Scottish Government making the demand, Mr Mackay was in a position to very and substantiate whether such messages had been sent.The above aside, we dont know yet whether the First Minister asked two obvious questions before it approached the newspaper. The first of those questions is \"Did you do it \"If Mr Mackay denied it and this was why the Scottish Government sought evidence we now know that his denial would have been a lie. If he didnt lie then the FM was obliged to ask the next question, which would have been along the lines of \"Is this the only one \"Yesterday, the FM denied knowledge of any other instance. As a result, one of two things must be true. The first might be that the FM lied at Holyrood. The second is that she didnt ask the question. The first would be a bare-faced lie uttered by someone in high office. If she did not ask Mr Mackayhe had done this sort of thing before, we are left with a First Minister who is unable to bring an obvious question to mind in a crisis. The alternative would be that she chose not to ask in a hopeless effort to claim plausible deniability.Many of us wonderthis Governments first actions will always be to protect itself and the cause it promotes rather than protect the people of Scotland from the excesses of those who work within it and who are leading lights in that cause.Kenny Wilson, Greenock.DEREK Mackay should do the honourable thing now and resign as an MSP. His shameful conduct has no place in any decent society.The scandal involving Mr MacKay may only be the beginning of an intensely dficult period for the First Minister and for the Scottish Government with the highly publicised trial of Alex Salmond taking place next month and the ongoing debate over Indyref causing internal ision and doubt. However, followers of Scottish independence must look beyond personalities and media sensationalism during this thorny time to reassure themselves that their quest for self-determination rises above human failings and parochial party politics.It is important to keep a clear vision of what kind of country we wish to live in at this time when we are creeping towards the Brexit abyss and are ruled from Westminster by a Government that regards Scotland as a colony and those who represent us with a mixture of ambivalence and disdain. The quest for a land where social equality and justice, together with a stable economy wherein fair distribution of wealth is a priority, is eminently achievable within a Scotland, that through the EU or even EFTA, finds itself again part of a European family of nations. The very heart of the UK continues to decay from within thanks to the perpetual class system, self-interest of the economic elite and the archaic political system.We must look beyond the current travails of the Scottish Government and keep our eyes on the prize. Independence for Scotland is no longer a pipe dream, it is almost within our grasp.Owen Kelly, Stirling.WHY does Allan Fitzpatrick bother doubting the ability of the SNP to govern competently in an independent Scotland  Has he not yet realised that the whole point of independence is that we will have the government we choose, which means that he, like everyone , will have a choice of parties to vote for to run the government  Who is to say that the SNP will still exist, at least in its present form  Many of its current members who want independence will probably revert to parties with which they formerly had affinity and the SNP therefore will either disband or develop into a dferent party.What matters is Scotlandrsquos ability to run its own affairs efficiently under a government of our own choice.P Davidson, Falkirk.IrsquoM in no way shocked at the behaviour of some senior SNP politicians. But yet at every election the SNP portrays itself as an exemplar of upstanding behaviour, in direct contrast with the den of inequity at Westminster. It seems to think Holyrood is new, post-modern, a gleaming city on the hill. Westminster is colonial, stuck in the th century, sleazy, its politicians reflecting this.The numerous recent and past events demonstrate that SNP politicians are all too human. As prone to stupidity, misconduct, aice, licentious and pettiness as any other group of people that have ever existed.Perhaps the SNP and its supporters could stop pretending that their politicians are somehow scandal-free colossi sent down from Arthurrsquos Seat.

for example.\"White also discussed PETAs mission to change common phraseology that include animal references. The old mantra \"bring home the bacon\" would become \"bring home the bagels\" and rather than saying \"kill two birds with one stone\", we should instead plump for \"feed two birds with one scone\".Which sounds less like it is raising awareness about animal welfare than it does a series of cheesy advertising slogans to promote a homespun bakery. Also, the organisation is called PETA: the word pet is actually in the name.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan promptly rubbished PETAs suggestions ndash reminding White that the word \"pet\" comes from the Scottish Gaelic \"peata\", which means \"tame animal\" ndash and I found myself agreeing with him.Thanks a lot, Jenner.

Funnily enough, it is not being roused from your slumber in the dead of night by the gently prodding snout of a cheeky-yet-adorable collie.Research by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology suggests that harsh alarm tones might be linked to increased levels of morning grogginess, while melodic tunes could improve alertness. The crux: out with beep, beep, beep and in with the good vibrations of the Beach Boys.Choosing an alarm tone is a tricky business. I have a friend who swears by waking up to the soothing crooning of Enya, while another insists upon seven alarms simultaneously blaring out what sounds like an air-raid siren warning of imminent nuclear attack.The one time I shared a hotel room with the latter friend it took the best part of four hours and several stf drinks before my heart rate ed to anything resembling normal.Personally, I use my iPhone clock as an alarm which is grand.

The world will stop this evening to watch a carnival of wealth, adulation, fame, talent, glamour and ndash most of all ndash power. It is a night bestowed with global signicance. Millions around the planet see it as the cultural and artistic heart of the year. Wersquore told that the Oscars matter.But is that true  Do the Oscars say anything about the world we live in, about our culture, our society  Or is it all, as the cynics believe, just an empty, gaudy show that signies nothing Who decides First of all, letrsquos be clear what the Oscars are. Like their British equivalent, the Baftas, the Oscars are an expression of how a very narrow sliver of society sees both culture and the world at a specic moment in time. When it comes to the Oscars, that sliver of society is the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.It is the academyrsquos roughly , members who hand out the gongs. All members are part of the film industry ndash directors, cinematographers, producers ndash but actors make up the biggest proportion, %.Of the academyrsquos active voters, % are white, % male and % over , and about one-third are former Oscar nominees and winners. Given wersquore in Hollywood, the academy also has a liberal bias. Right-wing movies ndash unless yoursquore Clint Eastwood ndash donrsquot get far.For such a youthful art form as cinema, the old, white, wealthy, male demographic is jarring ndash and it lies at the heart of the Oscarsrsquo ersity problem, with not enough black or female artists up for awards.The question of raceThe movie Green Book, which won Oscars in  for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali, is a good case study when it comes to liberalism and ersity.In an elevator pitch it sounds the perfect pro-ersity film: a white, working-class man learns to be a better person by working for an intellectual black man.The only problem is the film was hammered for its ldquowhite saviour narrative. In the film, the black guy only learns about himself thanks tothe white guy. Green Book was criticised for perpetuating a fantasy that racism only happened in thepast ndash itrsquos set in the s ndash ratherthan today.Green Book is a perfect example of Hollywood trying to be liberal, but falling on its face with a story about black le filtered through white eyes. If the academy wanted to hand the Best Picture Oscar to a ldquogood film about race last year it could have awarded BlacKkKlansman by Spike Lee.American powerSo the Oscars represent a very narrow worldview. They also represent a very American worldview. Of course, America is the planetrsquos cultural powerhouse, but the Oscars crowd out the vast majority of films which donrsquot come from the English-speaking world.The rules have a built-in bias against foreign films. Any contender for the big awards ndash Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay ndash must play for seven nights in LA. That might be hard for a brilliant but broke filmmaker from Africa or Asia.The nominee for Best Foreign Film doesnrsquot have to open in America ndash but it does have to be its countryrsquos official selection, which in itself is a mountainous task of networking, campaigning and schmoozing.The schmoozeSpeaking of schmoozing ndash thatrsquos the other problem which erodes belief in the Oscars having real cultural signicance. If you want your film to win you need deep pockets.Winning an Oscar is all about campaigning ndash and campaigning costs. In , Doctor Dolittle was a turkey. Over budget, critically hated and a box office disaster, it still managed to get a Best Picture nomination, and eventually won Best Song and Visual Effects after th Century Fox launched a champagne-fuelled charm offensive for Academy members.In , the schmaltzy Shakespeare In Love beat Saving Private Ryan when Harvey Weinsteinrsquos studio Miramax spent an unheard-of  million on an Oscar campaign.Money, however, does not buy cultural signicance, or lasting appeal. Who cares about Shakespeare InLove today The golden ageSo the Oscars have more than their fair share of problems ndash and itrsquos hardto argue that the awards, as a whole, have something consistently signicant to say about the world, cultureand society.However, that doesnrsquot mean inidual Oscar-winning films arenrsquot important. Many speak directly about societyrsquos big issues, the problems confronting the world and the changing shape of culture. When the Academy gets it right ndash which isnrsquot often ndash it gets it very right.The seventies is a good era to explore ndash after all, itrsquos the golden age of modern cinema. In , Kramer vs Kramer swept the boards, winning five Oscars including Best Picture. It stars Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, and tells the story of their orce. The film focuses a lot on their child, Billy, caught in the middle.Billy was a symbol of generation X ndash the first generation to grow up with orce normalised. The film explores gender roles ndash who should raise a kid and why  ndash womenrsquos rights, fathersrsquo rights, the growing demands of corporate careerism, work-le balance and single parenthood. Kramer vs Kramer was socially astute and culturally ahead of its time.That same year Apocalypse Now won two technical Oscars ndash Cinematography and Sound. Today, itrsquos Francis Ford Coppolarsquos film which has stood the test of time much more than Kramer vs Kramer.Divorce is no longer a zeitgeist subject, but Apocalypse Now continues to say something culturally signicant: that Western power is dangerous. Often it is films which are nominated for Oscars, but donrsquot scoop the Best Picture award, which make the most interesting cultural statements. In , the academy basically replicated what happened the year before ndash it gave four big gongs to another family drama, Ordinary People.However, Raging Bull ndash hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made, and a film which has easily outlasted its Oscar rivals ndash only won two awards, including Best Actor for Robert De Niro as the boxer Jake LaMotta. It was a study in ldquotoxic masculinity decades before the term was coined.Sometimes, though, the academy just goes a bit mad ndash like in  when it gave four Oscars to Network but still handed the Best Picture award to Sylvester Stallonersquos Rocky. Network is a brutal, brilliant satire, which still says something culturally signicant about the media and society.War: where it all beganIf we go right back to the first Oscars, in , we see the Best Picture winner, the war film Wings, struggling to make sense of the First World War. The US Library of Congress has listed Wings, which starred early screen idol Clara Bow, as a film of ldquocultural signicance because it was a real pioneer in the industry.The following year, , saw cinema still wrestling with the aftermath of war and looming danger in Europe. All Quiet On The Western Front was the big winner. After protests by the Nazi Party in Germany, the film proved its cultural signicance by promptly getting banned.The Second World War profoundly affected the Oscars as neutral America tilted towards Britain. Gone With The Wind ndash although racially unsettling today ndash made clear that war was monstrous. It beat The Wizard Of Oz to the Best Picture award in . Oz, though, summed up better the sense of dislocation, confusion, fear and nostalgia sweeping a world facing global conflict.In , British and American culture fused when Mrs Miniver ndash which tells the story of an ordinary English housewe during wartime ndash took six Oscars, including Best Picture, Director and Actress . Casablanca won Best Picture the following year with a clear message about Americarsquos attachment to Europe: wersquoll always have Paris.The big issuesAs the years march on, we see that so many Oscar nominees were commercially successful but artistic non-entities. The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, anyone Still, a few of the Best Picture winners stand out, capturing perfectly the spirit of the times in which they were made. On The Waterfront, which won Best Picture in , looks at le from a uniquely th-century working-class perspective. West Side Story in  used the cover of a musical to tackle immigration.In , though, To Kill A Mockingbird ndash a film fuelled by the US civil rights movement ndash lost out to Lawrence Of Arabia. David Leanrsquos epic is a visual delight, but itrsquos a clunking and colonial take on the Arab world.In The Heat Of The Night, the  drama starring Sidney Poitier as a black detective in the Deep South,won Best Picture and put African-Americans front and centre. In , homosexuality was explored in Midnight Cowboy, although the film is critiqued for homophobia today.Mental illness was the theme in when Best Picture went to One Flew Over The Cuckoorsquos Nest.

The Hurt Locker took six Oscars in  and made history when Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director. An emotionally astute war film, it signalled the power dynamic between the sexes shting both in Hollywood and across the west.Then, in , Moonlight took Best Picture.

Itrsquos one of those films which crystallised the time in which it was made ndash in Moonlightrsquos case right in the middle of Black Lives Matter.In , the bizarre fairy tale The Shape Of Water won Best Picture. Beneath the surface lay an examination of female sexuality, with all its quirks and wonders laid bare. Its central character, played by Sally Hawkins, may be mute but the story is about women finding their voice in the world of men.This yearrsquos nomineesSo what of tonightrsquos Best Picture nominees  Do they speak to our times  Certainly some do. Joker is perhapsthe film with most cultural clout.Some see it as a comment aboutthe left-behind, gun nuts, socially awkward losers and the alt-right.Thatrsquos mistaken, but evenit weretrue it would show a film unafraid of tackling the big social questions.What Joker really explores is the increasing isolation of modern le, the breakdown of community, the corruption of decency in an amoral world. In the era of social media, hate, and disinformation, Joker couldnrsquot be more of its time. It speaks directly to the experience wersquore all going through right now.However, itrsquos unlikely Joker will win Best Picture ndash though Joaquin Phoenix should be a cert for Best Actor. Joker is too edgy for the academy to give it the top prize.The most likely winner is . Wartime heroism wins awards ndash think Schindlerrsquos List and The Pianist. The only thing that wins more awards than wartime bravery is Meryl Streep ndash nominated a record  times.Sam Mendesrsquo First World War film does speak of something prevalent in our society ndash nostalgia for a glorious past. The veneration of the past lurks within the rise of Western populism. Thatrsquos not to say  isnrsquot a good film, it is ndash itrsquos just that it says something a little disturbing about our current cultural obsessions.The gangster epic The Irishman sees Martin Scorsesenot just to form but also old ground as he rummages through the undergrowth of toxic masculinity again. Jojo Rabbit, a dark fairy tale about le in the Hitler Youth, may seem quirkybut itrsquos also back on safe Oscar territory: wartime heroism.Like Greta Gerwigrsquos multi-nominated Lady Bird in , Little Womencontinuesthe rebalancing of the cultural scalesby telling stories specically about women and by women. The Netflix movie Marriage Story is essentially a Kramer vs Kramer reboot for millennials.Ford v Ferrari finds itself in the slot marked ldquowell-made film that no-one particularly cares about. Still, it had enough star power to ensure nominations. In terms of cultural import, itrsquos al. Think The Big Short from  ndash nominated for five awards, won one. In a decade, few will remember it.Quentin Tarantinorsquos Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is fun, but itrsquos really just an in-joke for Tinsel Town. For comparison, therersquos Robert Altmanrsquos  movie The Player ndash it too was Hollywood on Hollywood and earned a clutch of nominations. Again, few remember or care today.Parasite is the oddball in the mix. Firstly itrsquos foreign ndash and although foreign films rarely make it into the Best Picture category, the last few years saw things change with The Artist, which inexplicably won in , and Roma, which inexplicably lost to Green Book last year.Could a South Korean comedy-horror win Best Picture  If wersquore judging a film on what it says about culture and society then Parasite should be a leading contender. If you want a movie which explores lersquos inequalities and the deadly nature of the rich-poor ide, then pick Parasite.Who emerges as top dog all depends on whether this is a year when the academy gets it right, and rewards a film which explains where we are right now when it comes to culture and society ndash orthe academy gets it wrong and just slaps a gold star on what it thinks is an important film, but is in reality just an ephemeral piece of entertaining fluff which says nothing about the world."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-gardens-scheme-peek-secret-spaces","story":"In a tiny corner of what was once Glasgowrsquos shipbuilding heartland, bordered by a steel spiked fence and overlooked by a car park, a garden oasis waits to wake from its slumber.Lovingly created on a derelict site of a former shipyard, the delphiniums, ornamental grasses and gerbera of the Duchess of Montrose Memorial Garden have brightened its small corner of Govan since it openedlast summer.Normally restricted to a select few visitors, the city garden is tiny compared with the manicured grandeur of Gardyne Castle,  miles north in Angus, with its perfectly pruned knot garden, bluebell wood, fishpond and immaculate lawn.Meanwhile, at the rear of a fairly ordinary semi-detached house in an ordinary street in Ayrshire, therersquos an extraordinary garden growing ndash exotic tree ferns, towering bamboo and feathery palms have turned what wasa bog-standard Scottish back garden with typically crumbling shed and untameable ivy into a minitropical jungle.For gardeners who have not been blessed with a single green finger, these and dozens of other lovingly nurtured and weather-defying gardens are either something to aim for or a reason to just throw in the trowel.They are among hundreds of gardens up and down the country now being pruned and planted in preparation for Scotlandrsquos Gardens Scheme, an annual showcase which celebrates the often hidden beauty of the nationrsquos private havens, community allotments and therapeutic school and retirement home gardens.Many of the  gardens taking part are labours of love, growing in defiance of wild Scottish weather and carefully cultivated by gardeners more likely to be found dusting the rose bushes than relaxing on a recliner wondering why the freesias have died.Around % of gardens involved in this yearrsquos scheme feature specially created wildle areas designed to attract birds, bees, butterflies and bugs ndash inspiration, the organisers hope, for visitors to encourage bioersity in their own gardens.The scheme sees gardens open to visitors at certain times throughout the year or by appointment, and includes  which will open for the first time ndash among them social support charity The Preshal Trustrsquos Govan garden.Some seem to defy the odds: at the most northerly garden, Norby at Burnside in Sandness, Shetland, Chinese tree peonies, shrub roses, lilies, hellebores, and grasses fromNew Zealand thrive despite the exposed landscape.And at Leathad Ard, Upper Carloway on Lewis, the owners refused to be deterred by the westerly winds, challenging hillside setting and surrounding peat bog to create a garden of colourful herbaceous borders, exposed beds packed with delicate blooms, fruit orchards, and vegetable patches.The scheme asks visitors to pay a small fee to visit each garden which then goes towards a range of charities, infor a look at often hidden back gardens and private woodlands where wildle thrive, and snowdrops and bluebells carpet the floor.Visitors who make an appointment to visit  Burnton Road in Dalrymple will step from a typical Ayrshire street tino a tropical haven. ldquoThe garden was fairly awful when we moved here, says David Blatchford, who since  has transformed the triangular corner plot into a welcoming jungle.ldquoBack then it was just a lawn, a gigantic leylandii, ivy and a crumbling shed.While that may sound like most Scottish gardens, David and his we Margaret planned ahead and brought favourite tree ferns and bamboo from their former property to plant.With the leylandii, ivy and shed gone, they created raised beds to tackle the dearth of topsoil and laid a serpentine path which now meanders through the dense, lush foliage, past giant, glossy leaves and towering palms.Bonsai and potted terrestrial ferns including rare blechnum species and succulents rest on the patio. Outside, hardy and tender bromeliads and aroids share space with lilies, cannas, gingers and bursts of Mexicanfeather grass.At the front of the garden, dahlias and a Chinese imported buddleia bring bursts of colour and dozens of red admiral butterflies.ldquoWe do have time to sit in the garden and enjoy it, he adds. ldquoAnd we do have a washing line ndash you just donrsquot see it hidden behind the bamboo.Around three hoursrsquo drive away, at Barochreal in Kilninver near Oban, a remarkable -year labour of love has seen its hard-working owners, Nigel and Antoinette Mitchell, scrape and shovel scrub grass and old sheep pens into a colourful haven.The pretty garden which hugs their white-walled, two-storey home buzzes with bees from their hives.A wild garden and rockery complement a rose garden created from a former sheep fank while raised beds have been made using stone left behind when the old dairy was taken down. Further on, their  acres extend to a waterfall and a small glen where  species of moth and more than  species of wildflowers thrive, including three types of wild orchid, and red squirrels and pine martens make their home.ldquoItrsquos slowly evolved, says Antoinette. ldquoAs one thing is done, another comes up. It takes all our energy to keep it going. Whenever therersquos nice weather, instead of enjoying it, wersquore working in it.The garden is so impressive that coach parties often roll in for a look. ldquoThey start coming at the end of April. The hardy plant people and the rhododendron people. People staying in ious hotels will phone up and ask to come.Many gardens have embracedldquowild elements to boost falling numbers of pollinators.At Baile Geamhraidh on the island of Lismore in the Inner Hebrides, a biodynamic farm encourages wildflowers, birds, bees and butterflies. Created from a field, the garden reflects the ecclesiastical history of the island, and includes a vegetable garden, a tree nursery, a physic garden and orchard.It is framed by standing stones, meadows and mountains, while rare breed Shetland horned cattle roam.Meanwhile, Bruckills Croft in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, home of award-winning wildle gardener Helen Rushton, has a butterfly alley, wildflower meadow and pond.Other gardens have touching stories behind them. Angusrsquos Garden at Barguillean Farm in Glen Lonan, near Oban, was created as a motherrsquos tribute to her son who was killed while working in Cyprus in .Almost  gardens will open for snowdrop and

from the scheme, while organisers hope gardens will inspire visitors to incorporate ideas and wildle features in their own gardens.Terrill Dobson, national organiser for Scotlandrsquos Gardens Scheme, says: ldquoOur gardens and green spaces are ecosystems that nurture a vast array of bioersity including insects, butterflies, birds, small animals, earthworms and even beneficial bacteria.ldquoAnd these in turn benefit our gardens, through pollination, improved structure and pest control, just to name a few.ldquoWersquore hoping people will walk away inspired by what theyrsquove

rarest of them all, is usually found hiding behind a cairn, up a tree or curled up in a ball, snoozing.At noon most days, however, visitors to the Highland Wildle Park at Kincraig near Aviemore will be treated to a fleeting glimpse of its bushy tail, mean green-yellow eyes and thick fur, as one of the nationrsquos most elusive creatures emerges to snatch a lump of meat for lunch before retreating to the shadows.For most park visitors, that brief glimpse of the Scottish wildcats is at the top of their list of must-see attractions, possibly alongside Hamish the juvenile polar bear, a national treasure and the first cub born in the UK for  years, and the Amur tiger.What they wonrsquot see, however, is a massive behind-the-scenes effort spanning the UK and Europe, and which itrsquos hoped will throw a leline to ensuring Scottish wildcats ndash  times more endangered than the giant panda ndash will not just be around for generations to come, but could eventually become established in locations right across Scotland.Tucked out of sight on a patch of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandrsquos park which is out of bounds to visitors, a new wildcat reintroduction centre is about to become \"ground zero\" for the survival of a fragile species entwined in Scottish national identity but currently in a fierce catfight for its very survival.A combination of cross-breeding with feral and domestic cats, habitat loss, road accidents, historic persecution and disease has all but wiped out the purest of Scotlandrsquos treasured wildcat population.Left to their own devices, the tiny number with genes not already severely diluted from mating with outsiders, will dwindle, fade and disappear.Hopes are now pinned on a pound. million scheme led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandand, almost certainly, some amorous intervention from the speciesrsquo closest European cousins to help the Scottish wildcat get back on its feet.By the end of this year, the first wildcats will be in settled in at the new reintroduction centre,  breeding pairs which ndash assuming nature takes it course ndash should produce enough healthy offspring to see  wildcats reintroduced to carefully picked spots in the Cairngorms over a three-year period.Eventually itrsquos hoped they could be reintroduced where in Scotland ndash raising the possibility of the creatures becoming commonplace across the country.Although, according to David Barclay, cat conservation project officer with the RZSS who currently oversees the  wildcats in the UK-wide breeding programme, the first challenge is to save the handful of remaining Scottish wildcats from extinction.ldquoTherersquos perhaps a very small number of wildcats left in Scotland, he admits. ldquoAnd we have a lot of evidence that says the population is non-viable.ldquoWithout putting more wildcats back, they will almost certainly go extinct in the next few years.ldquoWildcats are in that short list of animals that are iconic species for Scotland, such as the golden eagle and the red squirrel, he adds.ldquoFor Scotland not to have wildcats would be a very sad day.At Kincraig, a recent pound.million EU LIFE grant added to funding from the Garfield Weston Foundation, the National Trust for Scotland, the Peoplersquos Trust for Endangered Species and the European Nature Trust, has enabled work to start on building the new centre.A recruitment drive is now under way to find  staff while plans are being drawn up for a major campaign to encourage domestic cat owners to neuter their pets to avoid the main threat to wildcatsrsquo future, hybridisation.Feral or domestic cats that enter the wildcat reserve will be trapped, neutered, vaccinated and released.Most of the  breeding pairs are expected to be sourced mainly from the UK-wide wildcat breeding programme but some are likely to make the journey from Europe, in particular Spain, where wildcats have been found to share physical similarities to their Scottish relations, and populations are more stable.It may sound like a further erosion of the Scottish wildcatsrsquo precious gene pool, however Mr Barclay insists the European presence will strengthen, not weaken, the wildcatsrsquo chances of survival.ldquoThe European wildcats will improve the gene pool, he states. ldquoThe cat we have is a European wildcat, itrsquos just a dferent population thatrsquos more critically endangered.ldquoIf we have to bring some cats from Europe ndash and it would be a relatively small number ndash we would want to bring them from a population where we feel that there are similarities with Scottish cat.ldquoAnd Spanish wildcats look very similar to Scottish wildcats.ldquoIf you bring wildcats from Europe, you are bringing new genetic material which gives Scottish wildcats a boost in terms of the gene pool.The fight to save Scotlandrsquos wildcats has already crossed international boundaries: as well as working with Scottish Natural Heritage, the Cairngorms National Park Authority and Forestry and Land Scotland, the RSZZ Saving Wildcats project ndash the only official wildcats project in the country ndash is partnered with Swedish wildle park Nordenrsquos Ark, and Spainrsquos Junta De Andaluciacutea, which led the successful recovery of the Iberian lynx.It has been boosted by the arrival of two potential \"Adam and Eve\" wildcats: male and female, both accidentally trapped, both found to have surprisingly strong wildcat genes.While the male is now at an English zoo where itrsquos hoped nature will soon play its part in boosting wildcat numbers, the female, Lossie, has already produced five kittens from two litters.Last year, one of her offspring, Katrine, delivered her first litter ndash four kittens, each carrying on its tiny shoulders the future of a species which has roamed Scotlandrsquos hills since the Ice Age.ldquoFor next few years itrsquos about getting all the right tools in one place so we can create a viable, sustainable population of wildcats in one location, adds Mr Barclay.ldquoOnce we have been through that process and know that the reintroduction technology works, then we can replicate that across Scotland.ldquoThe crucial element is controlling the threat: we canrsquot release them until the threat is removed, and one of the biggest threats in hybrid and domestic cats.The reintroduction of wildcats would follow in the wake of the reintroduction of sea eagles, water voles and beavers to the wild ndash each native to Scotland but brought to extinction through hunting and loss of habitat.The wildcatsrsquocould also pave the way for other animals including lynx and wolves. Campaign group Rewilding Britain has also suggested the reintroduction of long-gone species including the dalmatian pelican, bison, boar and moose.Worryingly, however, are further signs that Scottish wildcats ndash and in some cases their European cousins ndash are hanging by the thinnest of threads.Last month an international genetic study of wildcats in  European countries published in the journal Conservation Genetics warned it had failed to identy a single pure wildcat in Scotland.Across Europe, wildcat numbers were also found to be affected by hybridisation, with the first example of a hybrid cat in the Eastern Alps of Austria.ldquoIn Scotland, we found exclusively hybrids of dferent classes, indicating hybridisation has been occurring for several generations, it states. ldquoAll samples from Scotland were identied as hybridshellip supporting previous findings that the genetic integrity of that wildcat population has been seriously compromised.It also presented a dire warning for the future of the species.ldquoFrequent hybridisation with the domestic cat may regionally threaten the genetic integrity of the European wildcat, as documented by the example of the wildcat in Scotland, it adds, ldquopotentially leading even to the genetic extinction of local populations."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-ferry-fiasco-tangled-web-operators-owners-works-theory-least","story":"Victorian steamship tycoon David MacBrayne left his thriving business to his son and namesake in .Soon the fleet, connecting Glasgow to the isles and peninsulas of one of the worldrsquos longest coastlines, was to peak at  packet ships.It was never to be so big again, even more than century later.:Scottish ferries fiasco: competition watchdog issues stark warning to SNPOn the eve of the Great Depression, the MacBraynes sold out their family firm.

CMAL, rather than CML, is the direct corporate successor of the old Caledonian MacBrayne company and it officially lists its foundation as .:Scotlands ferry fiasco: meet the eight people who run CMALIn effect, CMAL owns most of Scotlandrsquos ferries ndash including three operated by private company Sercoon subsidised routes to and from Orkney and Shetland ndash and many of the nationrsquos ferry ports. Like CML, CMAL is owned by the Scottish Government.This has been how ferries have been run in Scotland since the last year of the old Scottish Executive. CML has secured successive franchisesto run services using CMAL assets.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

There are now no more excuses.“We need a clear understanding of when RET and cheaper fares will be delivered for the Northern Isles. It is high time that passengers and businesses are treated justly.”Conservative list MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston said the government still had questions to answer over the ferry contract. He dubbed the process a #sorry affair# and said it had seen public money wasted.“Paul Wheelhouse also needs to clary the current situation with regards to the legal action by another ferry operator in the islands and whether that is still to be concluded.“SNP ministers in Edinburgh should remember that these are vital links for our islands – and we need a serious approach that ensures our services are protected and improved.“Unfortunately anything to do with this SNP government and the procurement of ferries – either here in the Northern Isles or where around the country – seems to result in endless delays, bitter legal disputes, extra costs to taxpayers, and shame-faced announcements from ministers trying to explain where it all went wrong.“It isn’t good enough, and the people and businesses who rely on a reliable and resilient ferry service deserve far better than this.” raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"4 union street lerwick shetland ze1 0et ","story":" Offers Over £,Immaculately presented, three bedroom, mid-terraced house situated in a sought after, very central Lerwick location by the bowling green and within easy reach of Commercial Street and other amenities.The accommodation is arranged over three floors, comprising a bedroom and shower room on the ground floor with open-plan kitchen and dining room on the first floor.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: We would like to again assure the public that plans are in place to deal with a positive test for coronavirus in Northern Ireland when it occurs. It is also inevitable that a number of people will continue to be tested on a precautionary basis in the weeks ahead and it is important to keep these tests in perspective. A test does not mean that a positive result is expected or likely. As of February , a total of  tests were concluded across the UK, of which  were confirmed negative and three positive.Dferent precautionary measures are taken as part of the testing protocols. This can include protective clothing for health and social care staff - for their protection and protection of the wider public.

When something is so integral to yourself, that was very dficult, he said.You have a constant internal dialogue and you hope it will change and then you find out that you just have to live with it. I didn#t know anybody who was gay at that stage. It is a very isolated situation to be in.Meeting his future we at University of Ulster when the pair were students at the age of , the couple eventually had one son. Mr Creelan also forged a career within the RUC and PSNI, eventually reaching the rank of inspector, before his retirement a number of years ago.Mr Creelan explained that it was the death of close gay friend in the force, Constable Darren Bradshaw, who was murdered in May , which prompted him to announce his inner feelings to his family.I guess it was in . I was in the police at that stage. For me I had wanted to do it for a long time, but it was the death of Darren and having to deal with that professionally that prompted me, he said.I was talking to my we about him and his death and that#s when we dealt with things.Her family reacted really badly at the time. We were still living together and trying to make things work. Once her family had found out, that became impossible. I was already not involved with my own family.You think you can make it work and when we separated our friends didn#t know why. I suppose I thought maybe she might know, but she had no idea whatsoever. It was a very brutal discovery.He added: When it happened, I had a very negative reaction and so it cost a lot in terms of friends and family at the time. With me, nothing had been going on other than what was in my head. My son would have been about nine at that time.My we and I had - child care and eventually when he was ready and wanted to ask the questions, he was told what the situation was.As a parent I didn#t change. Just as I took being married seriously, I took the job of being a parent seriously.From the dficult days of the past, Vincent now celebrates the immensely positive relationship he has with his son and grandson.I am in the very privileged position of being gay and being a parent and grandfather. I have a really great le with my partner, he said.I had a great career and I have a lovely family. As a -year-old now, the journey I have had the past  years is amazing. I am lucky I have a son who is  now and is one of my best friends. I look after my grandson very regularly.In that regard I am a firm believer that le gets better when you come out.Giving his reaction to ITV host Schofield public announcement on Friday, the Newtownards man said the support shown to Mr Schofield could shine a light for others.He has obviously been having those discussions with his family, which is a mature thing to do, he added.I do think he is in a great position to really say that this is a good, positive thing.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry dominated the final quarter of normal time but seven wides in the last ten minutes, including an Aidan McCluskey effort that clearly went inside the post, saw the home side fail to translate their control into a winner. Fermanagh scored the first two points of extra-time before Derry took control of the game once again. googletag.cmd.push Murphys goal had a shade of luck attached to it, with a long left footed effort from the wing deceiving goalkeeper Aidan Keenan. The Fermanagh keeper denied Doherty a second goal in the next attack, turning his effort over the bar. The Glen man added three further scores - including a sweet outside of the boot effort to cement the win. Derry elected to play against the breeze and for  minutes of the first half, they played a text book possession game against a gale force wind.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things.

Since diagnosis they have received the much needed help and support of Goldenhar UK, a charity run by families and volunteers affected by the extremely rare syndrome.Now Aodhans uncle hopes to be able to give something back by raising cash and swapping the backdrop of the Celtic Park for the Efel Tower in a fundraising drive.Marty told the County Derry Post: “It’s a very rare condition – I think  in  suffer from it and it’s visible from birth.“Obviously, neither my sister nor I had ever heard of it but she noticed that something wasn’t right. The doctors didn’t pick up on it but I suppose the condition is so rare that they hadn’t seen it before.“My sister had to push but the doctors then realised and to be fair to them they’ve been more than helpful. Some have come over from England to see Aodhan.The John Mitchels Claudy captain added: “It will affect the development of bones like his spine, but they won’t know completely until he grows up and they see more and more how it’s affecting him.“He will have to go through a few minor surgeries just to correct a few things and whenever he starts learning to stand, it’ll affect him that way, but he’s now eight months old and is developing into a happy, lively wee child.”Goldenhar Syndrome is so rare that initially Marty’s sister Catherine assumed they were alone in being affected in Northern Ireland, but since he posted his fundraising efforts online, others have been in touch.“My sister didn’t know that there was anyone  in Northern Ireland with the condition, but as soon as I put up the fundraiser, we’ve been contacted by a local lady who was able to provide my sister with a lot of information and they’re actually meeting up now.“I think there are cases in Northern Ireland but they don’t have a  or a chance to talk about it or help each other.”Marty opted for the Paris marathon despite other, closer alternatives and he is looking forward to taking on the challenge in its picturesque surroundings.“Ah, it was just more attractive. I don’t like running anyway but I just thought ‘why not ’ London is nearly impossible to get into so the Paris one was easy enough to get into and it’s probably nicer to run round than London.My mum and dad are hoping to go and my we, children and her family are all going.

Police informed told activists of death threats made against them.InAugust , Dalradian announced that it would no longer propose using cyanide in the gold mining process, something that had caused reat concern to local people.In November, campaigner Fidelma O’Kane was successful in the High Court after she took a judicial review against the Northern Ireland Environment Agencyover a discharge consent it had awarded to Dalradian The consent allowed the company to discharge nine heavy metals into the local Owenkillew river.In response to the objection letters, a Dalradian spokesperson told The Canary: “Dalradian’s proposal for an underground gold and silver mine in West Tyrone has received over , letters of support. This is an unprecedented number for any planning project in Northern Ireland.“Last year we made a number of environmental enhancements to our proposed processes including removing cyanide and reducing water demand by %. Over % of the objections to the planning application predate these changes.”Earlier this month, Dalradian welcomed theof devolved government. Peter McKenna, the company’s Community Relations Manager, said the companys proposals for what he called anenvironmentally responsible, underground mine supports key policy areas of the new Executive.Mr McKenna said: “Dalradian has been developing an economically transformative project that will be one of the largest ever inward investments west of the Bann, supporting , direct, indirect and induced jobs.We’re pleased that a growing proportion of the local community are supportive of the project. , people have already visited our existing site and engaged with us on all aspects of the plan.He added: The deposit at Curraghinalt includes copper, silver and gold – metals which are vital for the new renewable technologies that will help drive decarbonisation.Mr McKenna said that the company operates to the highest environmental standards and supports strong regulatory oversight of industry.We welcome the Executive’s plan to establish an independent Environmental Protection Agency as an opportunity to further support this critical .“We look forward to working with the Executive to explore how we can maximise the benefits Dalradian’s project can bring, not just to Tyrone, but all of Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After the bell had sounded, and after consulting with the ringside physician, referee Joel Scobie stopped the bout. It was a quicker than expected victory for Coyle who wanted the contest to go beyond one round.“Im always glad to have another stoppage but I wish it had gone on longer,” he admitted. “He didnt come out for round two. He had to retire on the stool after the first round. My first round was just feeling him out, and working the jab andanything follows up then just finish it, but I never got the opportunity for that. I never got the opportunity to show how well prepared I was. I came home unscathed and fresh with no injuries. I didnt even get hit once in the whole round so were ready to go again.”Dumas came into the fight with a decent reputation and even boasted twice as many knock outs as his opponent. But whilst his reputation preceded him, the reality turned out to be much dferent.“To be honest I expected him to come straight at me after the first bell went but he went onto the back foot,” Coyle continued. “My plan was to put him on the back foot and for him to come at me which would have suited me because he would have walked on to my shots. “He took me by surprise by going on the back foot. Maybe he thought I was a lot bigger than he expected or maybe, when I threw the jab, he thought he had to do something dferent. He didnt hit me so I never felt any power. Anything he did throw my footwork was too fast and he didnt land a glove. As soon as he threw, I wasnt there. I was just in and out, in and out. He couldnt hit me.” googletag.cmd.push Another stepIt may have been over much too soon for Coyles liking, but regardless, it is another step in the right direction for the -year old, who is expecting big things in . “Its just part of the game,” he stated. “Its another knock out on my record which is good for me. I put in over  rounds of sparring in the build up as well so its not to say that Im not getting the rounds. I put the hard graft in the gym so I have those rounds under my belt anyway. Ill take the TKO but I wanted to showcase everything I have been working on over the last three months.”Coyle has no objections to getting back into the ring again so soon, and having stopped his last two opponents in double quick time, he is eager to get as much in-ring experience as possible. “Thats the next step. I would like to be back quickly. I want to get the rounds in. Ive only had three rounds in nine months. In that case I would like to get a fight just for the rounds. It wasnt in the plans butwe get the go ahead well take it.“The fight in the summer is going to be a massive step because I want to break into the top ten or top five in the world.” googletag.cmd.push SponsorsConnor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support Classique Floor Designs, The Thirsty Goat, Frankie Ramsey’s, The Bentley Bar, Paul’s Butchers, Brooklands Fencing, Sandwich Co , RJB Tiling, Curley’s Cars and Evolve Clothing official.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The ballot was ided into three sections, UK, Devolved and Local.In South Down, .% of over , young respondents said that protecting the environment was the most important UK issue, with almost % in favour of lowering the voting age to .Other key issues were tackling hate crime , welcoming refugeesand making UN Convention Rights of the Child law .Under devolved issues, .% of young people said mental health was the most important issue when compared to child poverty , ending kne crime , curriculum for leand stopping street harassment .Over , young people responded to this part of the ballot and % of responses were environmental issues mdash ranging from dealing with erosion at Ballyhornan to improving school eco-councils to introducing more recycling points.Overall, the top five biggest inidual local issues were stopping the amalgamation of St Patrickrsquos Grammar with St Maryrsquos and De La Salle High Schools in Downpatrick . Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment . These were followed by building a bridge between Strangford and Portaferry .The results were detailed in a report written by Cormac, who said he was ldquodelighted to have been able to recognise the dedication of young volunteers across South Down in helping their peers have their voices heard.He added: ldquoOrganising Make Your Mark for the past two years has been a challenge each time but one which I enjoy greatly and am privileged to be faced with. Itrsquos now time for politicians and decision makers to act upon the issues raised by local young people.Cormacrsquos role in seeking out the opinions of his peers was praised by Baroness Ritchie, former South Down MP.She said: ldquoCongratulations are due to Cormac for his tenacity, ingenuity, hard work, enthusiasm and attention to detail. He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey. Down, who showed every now and again that they could breach the Derry defence, worked their way forward and Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe halved the arrears with a super score.Derry captain, Chrissy McKaigue, made it a two-point game again with an inspirational score from the right, before Barry OrsquoHagan and McGuigan swapped points with  minutes gone.Worryingly, Downrsquos wide count was starting to mount as Paul Devlin and lsquokeeper Rory Burns both wasted scoring opportunities before the reliable OrsquoHare converted another free to leave it at - to -.The tit-for-tat nature of the scoring continued with OrsquoHare and McGuigan exchanging points, but Derry maintained their hard-earned advantage with a point from Alex Doherty.Cory Quinn and McGuigan also swapped scores, but just before the referee brought the first half proceedings to a conclusion, he denied Derry a goal chance and OrsquoHare took full advantage, pointing from a free to send Down in at the break trailing - to -.Immediately on the restart, Devlin was wide from a free and McGuigan showed how it should be done when he converted a m free to make it a two-point game again.It was now Derryrsquos turn to waste chances before Longstonersquos Conor Poland and OrsquoHare brought the sides level by the th minute.McGuigan was proving a real handful and he pointed his side back in front before Daniel Guinness levelled matters at - apiece.The feisty nature of the game continued with Down losing Poland to a black card.With just four minutes of the game remaining, Barry OrsquoHagan pointed Down ahead and a minute later Johnston eased his side into a two-point lead.Bradley kept Derry interested with a good score from play, but a free from ice cool OrsquoHare four minutes into added time at the end of the game secure a home win.Down: Rory Burns, Darren OrsquoHagan, Brendan McArdle, Ryan McAleenan, Shane Annett, Kevin McKernan, Gerard Collins, Jonny Flynn, Conor Poland , Barry OrsquoHagan , Paul Devlin, Owen McCabeJerome Johnston , Cory Quinn , Donal OrsquoHare .

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child. We share that we are united by angels, which is our motto.John said that there are now over  men who have joined the club and he and Pat hope to welcome more throughout the year.The first match will be held at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch on Friday, February  at pm. Men who have been affected by the loss of a child are invited to come along to spectate.Further details can be found on the Sands United County Down Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 In Demand.jpg","title":"Newcastle super gran loving life with ten grandchildren attending primary school  ","story":"MEET Newcastlersquos super gran Karen Cunningham.The  year-old is grandmother to ten pupils who all attend the townrsquos St Maryrsquos Primary School and nursery unit.The eight boys and two girls mdash who include a set of twins mdash are the sons and daughters of Karenrsquos three eldest children.While it may not be an official record, St Maryrsquos believe that this is the first time this has happened for as long as staff can recall.With a  week-old baby boy and another baby due in April, it looks like St Maryrsquos can rest assured of having one of Karenrsquos grandchildren at the school for the next decade at least.Karenrsquos son Andrew and his we Kristen have four children at St Maryrsquos mdash Reece in P, Keelie in P, Kai in P and Emie in nursery daughter Charlene Hamill and husband Dominic have four boys, Dara Hamill in P, twins Tiernan and Riley Hamill in P and Morgan Hamill in P and have a baby on the way daughter Kerrie-Louise Aspel and her partner Gary Kearney are parents to Nathan Kearney in P and Keegan Kearney in nursery school and  week-old Carly.While the mother of four, whose -year-old son Corey Madden still lives at home, admits to not always remembering the ages of her grandchildren, she could not be happier with her brood.ldquoMy grandchildren are the light of my le.

Elliersquos father Peter, brother-in-law Kieran and a neighbour were also quickly on the scene to help. Ellie sustained broken arms, legs, eye sockets, cheeks and teeth and had severe swelling on her brain.Due to the critical state of her injuries, the air ambulance was dispatched to the scene.When the medical team arrived at the family farm, they put Ellie into an induced coma to protect her brain ndash a procedure usually only done in a hospital environment.But, because the medical team includes both a doctor and a paramedic, they are able to carry out urgent medical care immediately at the scene.The air ambulance subsequently transported Ellie to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where she spent eight weeks, two of which in a medically-induced coma.Her family had been told to prepare for the worst as the extent of her injuries left doctors unsure of whether she would ever be able to walk or talk again.Discharged from hospital on September  last year, Ellie is now back at school studying for her GCSEs with plans to pursue a career in medicine.Ellie said: ldquoI donrsquot remember much about that day.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10960018.jpg","title":"council agrees  year lease necarne estate","story":"However no other Councillor supported this call and the matter was discussed under confidential matters with the approval of the lease being voted through.In a social media post,Councillor OCofaigh stated that the lease had been approved by Councillors.According to a Council statement the lease will see the creation of a ldquomulti-purpose tourism and leisure destination.The Council revealed that the lease ldquoalso proposes that provision is made for the potential development of a multi-sports centre and the Council has commissioned a feasibility study into the development of such a facility.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
