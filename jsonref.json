It is believed to be the world\u0027s largest man-made cave until today. Construction of the mysterious 816 Nuclear Military Plant began in 1966 under the direction of Chairman Mao, the country\u0027s founding father. It was designed to boost China\u0027s defence firepower against the Soviet Union in case of surprise attacks from the Communist neighbour. The relation between the two Communist countries had deteriorated since the beginning of the 1960s. In order to prevent Soviet intelligence from tracking down the facility, China erased the town of Bailang from every single map for nearly two decades - until 1984 when the project was called off due to a change in national strategies. The base wasn\u0027t declassified until April 2002, and is now a tourist attraction featuring futurist neon lights.          In order to prevent Soviet intelligence from tracking down the facility, China erased Bailang Town, where the plant was being built, from every single map for nearly two decades         The former classified hideout was turned into a tourist attraction lit by neon lights in 2016China Central Television Station reported about the ambitious Communist project in a programme released on Monday. According to the show, the 816 Nuclear Military Plant remained a top-level secret in the country for 17 years and was largely constructed by the 54th Division of the People\u0027s Liberation Army. With the Wu River flowing in front of it and the towering Wuling Mountain standing behind, the plant is said to be situated in an \u0027extremely secretive\u0027 location. The enormous space s more than 12 miles, with 18 main caves and more than 130 roads and tunnels, which vehicles are free to pass through. It was designed to tolerate thousands of tons of TNT explosives, and 76 workers were killed during the construction. Their average age was just 21.          The enormous space s more than 12 miles, with 18 main caves and more than 130 roads and tunnels, which vehicles are free to pass through.

Witnessing this mega city from the plane is to suddenly realise the immensity of modern China. Roughly 50 million people live in this urban sprawl surrounding Hong Kong.Lianzhou is a four-hour drive from Guangzhou into the forested mountains of Guangdong province. It is perhaps an unlikely destination for a major arts event. But in 2005, Duan Yuting, a 47-year-old former photo editor for a Guangzhou newspaper, chose the city to found the festival, now firmly established as China’s leading contemporary photography event.For its 15th edition, the work of 50 artists from China and around the world can be viewed in a museum and two former industrial spaces in Lianzhou.One of the first exhibitions on show at the Granary venue is Argentinian artist Seba Kurtis’s series Immigration Files. Kurtis grew up in Buenos Aires before, at 27, escaping the Argentinian financial crisis of 2001 for a new life in Europe, only to find more hardship as an illegal immigrant in Tenerife.One of the few things Kurtis brought to Europe was a shoebox of family photographs and Super 8 films, rescued from his grandmother’s home after a flood. Mixed in with the photographs were artworks that Kurtis’ younger sister had created with glitter and glue. The flood had damaged the images, causing the glitter to meld with the emulsion from the photographs. Kurtis set about digitising these precious, distorted images. “I realised I couldn’t see the faces of family members I might never see again,” he says. “The water damage became representative of violence in my later work.”Kurtis, who is now based in Manchester, UK, would spend seven years as an undocumented immigrant on the Canary Islands and mainland Spain. The uncertainty and anxiety of that time, and his memories of the life he left behind in Argentina pervade the images on show at Lianzhou. In them, he returns to the bucolic coastlines of Tenerife and the Canary Islands – the first sight of land countless refugees glimpse as they cling to hazardous rafts crossing the Mediterranean.Evoking his sister’s artworks, Kurtis decorates these photographic landscapes with glitter. But he does so meaningfully as a way to visually illustrate recent sociological surveys detailing suicides, evictions and crimes among refugee communities in the Canary Islands. Aesthetically, he is linking his own history to that of the migrant experience. “The glitter represents my story, my family’s story,” he says.The tolls of migration, the loss of family and the pull of home are felt by many millions of Chinese citizens. These are captured with vivid detail by Chinese artist Qian Haifeng in his portraiture series The Green Train, an exhibition eight years in the making, and also on show at the Granary.“Green trains” are China’s cheapest form of long-distance travel. For the price of one first-class ticket from Shanghai to neighbouring Nanjing, one can travel the entire length of China on a green train. They are typically used by the lowest-income migrants. On the national day of the People’s Republic of China in October, these relics of the Cultural Revolution become the vessels for millions of Chinese migrants to return to their ancestral homelands.In the decade before he became a known photographer, Qian Haifeng was a fellow passenger. He was fascinated by the people with whom he shared such journeys – and never met again. In Lianzhou, he describes the carriages of the green trains as “live stages, where everyone’s lives are on display for others to see, and where everyone present has the potential to play a leading role”.Duan Yuting, the festival’s director, awarded Qian with the Lianzhou Foto festival’s Punctum prize in 2015. “When I gave him the award, many professional Chinese photographers did not like it,” Duan says. “But his most important characteristic is that he’s not an artist. He is just the same as the people on the trains. He lived there with them, and that’s how he related to them. That’s why only he was able to take these photographs.”The forested wilderness surrounding Lianzhou is home to some of the world’s rarest and most elusive animals, including China’s dwindling population of tigers.With this in mind, Swiss photographer Alex Hanimann displays his series Trapped at the Granary. This a collection of photographic portraits of wild animals taken by camera traps at night.Hanimann originally intended the images to be used in a scientific survey. But he realised his camera was capturing these secretive animals at their most expressive and characterful.Hanimann considers these images to be self-portraits – and unconscious selfies. The animals were unaware of the cameras, yet Hanimann saw “a world of small, dramatic happenings, micro-dramas and gestures”.Chinese authorities were present at the festival’s opening and did not take kindly to the work of Jenny Rova. Much of Rova’s exhibition, Älskling, which translates as “sweetheart”, was removed by censors before the public had chance to see it. In doing so, the authorities robbed Lianzhou of the chance to witness a beautiful and intimate example of conceptual portraiture.In 2015, the Swedish photographer, who lives and works in Zürich and combines her artistic practice with her work as a waitress, contacted each of her former partners. She asked them to send her all the images they took of her during their relationship. She ended up with 55 photographs from nine former lovers, revealed to us as Anders, Amir, Jonas, Henning, Étianne, Boran, Johan, Bruno and Dan.Speaking at the festival, Rova describes Älskling as: “My attempt to capture the way we look at each other when we’re in love, from one lover to the next.”Älskling begins in the hills surrounding Uppsala, Sweden, where Rova spent her teenage years, and ends with her facing orce while bringing up her infant son.By making these shared moments public, Rova reveals how different relationships can reveal contrasting, hidden sides of our personalities. The images comment on the role former relationships can play in the present of our lives – “you can sense the identity behind the camera,” she says.Behind the ScarA photographer dealing with memory, sex and the self in a radically ergent way is the Chinese photojournalist Liang Yingfei, who works for Beijing’s Caixin Media. Perhaps more so than any other artform, documentary photography is highly controlled in China, so Liang and her fellow photojournalists must develop creative conceptual techniques to explore their subjects without alerting the authorities.In Lianzhou, Liang tells the stories of sexual abuse survivors. The series, she says, was instigated after a friend was abused by a charity worker on a voluntary trip.After obtaining the trust of survivors of abuse, Liang used her camera to “reconstruct and visualise the recurring traumatic nightmares victims have experienced in the aftermath”. Her images include a slug crawling along a woman’s skin as she sleeps and a doll being held underwater.Resplendent with purple hair, the Shanghai-based photographer Coca Dai has been in trouble with the authorities before. But they allowed the festival to exhibit his compulsive, chronological portraits of his partner, Judy, over the course of their eight years together. The exhibition moves from portraits taken on the day they met, when the couple were still teenagers, through to the birth of their first child and on to the present day. Judy often poses like a conventional model but Coca’s images of her show her asleep, eating, or bathing herself or their child.Much of China remains avowedly patriarchal so unvarnished experiences of Chinese femininity are often hidden from view. Lin Ye, the Chinese curator, says of Coca’s exhibition: “In history, women have always lived under ship of men. They have been disciplined and trained to accept male scrutiny and cater to male standards. This visual mechanism has allowed women to internalise men’s scrutiny on themselves.”Coca’s unflinchingly honest portrayal of Judy, created in the linage of artists such as Nan Goldin and Wolfgang Tillmans, is an inversion of this lineage. These images may be authored by a man but they are a powerful portrait of modern Chinese womanhood. And they point, defiantly, to a more tolerant and hopeful future.For his series Freezing Land, Shanghai-based photographer Chen Ronghui used Kuaishou, or “choir show”, a Chinese social video app comparable to TikTok, to explore the lives of young people living in Fularji. The area was a once prosperous district in the province of Heilongjiang, near the border with North Korea. “Kuaishou is despised by many people in China,” Chen says in Lianzhou. “This is a story of young people getting back the right to express themselves.”The temperature can often drop to -30C (-27.4F) in Fularji, but the economy has frozen, too. “We’re used to thinking of Chinese cities purely in the context of massive growth but Fularji is an exception,” Chen says. Fularji was once China’s most renowned steel town. In the 1960s, it became home to the headquarters of China First Heavy Industries, and more than 15 million immigrants came to the region during Mao’s era. Today, it’s facing a bigger economic recession than anywhere else in China.Chen used Kuaishou to explore the lives of millennials living in the once great town, making contact first with Lin Zi, a 14-year-old who uses a local cafe to stream live performances online. After dropping out of school, Lin has gained almost a million fans. “My parents abandoned me and I make money by doing drag shows on a live streaming app,” Lin told Chen.“The young people I met on Kuaishou all experience a sense of uncertainty,” Chen says. “They face a choice: to leave for challenges in bigger cities or stay behind and embrace their fate. This is a wider story about China the uncertainty about our future, no matter who we are.”• Lianzhou Foto festival 2019 takes place in Lianzhou, China, until 3 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58ba9d2d4d966769791bb092760533fb8a0f906e/0_0_5197_3307/master/5197.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b50e20ef23d7eb03f20ba1aa5ddc661c 480w","title":"google facebook dominance curbed cma report uk digital market","story":"Watchdog says there is strong argument for rules including forcing data sharing with rivalsThe UK competition watchdog has said there is a strong argument for introducing regulations to tackle the dominance of Google and Facebook, including potentially opening up search engine data to rivals and bringing in rules to give consumers greater control over their data.The Competition and Markets Authority’s 283-page interim report into the UK digital market shows the scale of the dominance of its two biggest players.“We are concerned that they are both now so large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms,” the CMA said. “The profitability of both Google and Facebook has been well above any reasonable estimate of what we would expect in a competitive market for many years.“Weak competition in digital advertising can increase the prices of goods and services across the economy and undermine the ability of newspapers and others to produce valuable content, to the detriment of broader society.”The report also cites examples of the actions Google takes to maintain its market dominance, such as paying $1.3bn (£1bn) in the UK last year to make sure it was the default search engine on mobile devices. The “vast majority” was paid to Apple.The CMA, which has said it is not minded to launch a full market investigation, has raised a number of proposals it feels are worth considering to address Google’s dominance, such as forcing it to share search data with rivals.The watchdog also found issues with how large technology companies harvest personal data to drive advertising revenues. It said platforms such as Facebook did not give consumers the option to opt out of personalised advertising, and privacy settings were made very difficult to access and navigate.“People are presented with a take-it-or-leave it offer, forcing them to share considerable amounts of personal data as a condition for using the service,” the report says.The CMA said a consumer may need to read 10,000 words to understand how their data would be used, but the average visit to the Google privacy page lasted 47 seconds. The CMA wants rules introduced to give people greater control over data and improve transparency.The CMA said it believed there was a “strong argument for the development of a new regulatory regime”.Andrea Coscelli, the regulator’s chief executive, said: “At the end of the study, we will present our findings to the new government as they decide whether and how to regulate what is an increasingly central sector in all our lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e129a9d2633d2c6a932028373187bbf482a27491/0_34_4945_2968/master/4945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=260055794ad13b5f10935e2e0b517e61","title":"brexit labour election corbyn left","story":"Honest reflection is rarely born from trauma: but a grief-stricken left must conduct a frank postmortem into the calamity of 12 December. While the 2017 election definitively proved the popularity of the left’s ideas, 2019 offers a brutal lesson from a campaign lacking a coherent message in the midst of a culture war.Those pointing at Brexit as a key factor in Labour’s election defeat are mocked for deflecting from the real reason: Jeremy Corbyn’s unpopularity. But the collapse in the Labour’s leader’s ratings between the 2017 election and last week’s rout are inextricably linked. In January, YouGov asked why voters with previously favourable opinions of Corbyn had changed their mind. About three-quarters of the responses were linked to Brexit, which dominated all political discourse after 2017 and smothered discussion of Labour’s popular domestic policies. Labour was tortured about how to keep its 2017 coalition of remain and leave supporters together, and was paralysed as a result.The decisive failure – yes, with hindsight – was that the Labour leadership did not use the political capital of the 2017 election to make a principled case for a Norway-style soft Brexit, and definitively rule out any future referendum. If that message had been held with stubborn discipline, a perception of weakness and dithering would have never set in. Whether it was truly politically feasible – and whether Labour’s membership could have worn it – is another question. The failure to move swiftly created space for the fantasy that the 2016 result could simply be reversed – and leading remain campaigners relished the opportunity to bully the Labour leadership and insult leave voters as gullible bigots.The left needs to own its failure in this election, but those who spent two years claiming Labour shifting to remain was a cost-free exercise, blocked only by Corbyn’s stubborn Euroscepticism, might consider entering their own period of introspection. Brexit is now settled: Labour must decisively rule out the prospect of rejoining the EU in its current form ever again.Labour has faced a remorseless assault – from daily papers and Facebook ads alike – but that cannot mean ignoring its own drastic errors. The victory lap that followed the 2017 election was a mistake, breeding fatal complacency. The leadership was often afflicted by a destructive bunker mentality – which was an understandable response to circumstances, but not a winning one. A bureaucratic machine-like politics at odds with the youthful idealism of the wider movement was too dominant. Labour insiders would often bemoan a complete lack of communications strategy – and no serious attempt to turn around Corbyn’s woeful ratings.What was so dire about the response to the antisemitism crisis was the absence of emotional intelligence. Corbyn is no antisemite, neither are the vast majority of the membership, but the antisemitism of a minority was real and caused profound hurt to Jews. What was missing in the leadership’s response wasn’t about improving internal processes – which happened too slowly – but rather engaging with the collective trauma of a minority who have faced systematic persecution for 2,000 years, an attempt to exterminate them within living memory, and who feel that at any moment, wherever they live, things could suddenly turn and, like their ancestors, they would have to flee. It is painful to watch a racist Tory political and media machine condemn the Labour party for racism – but we must accept that Jewish hurt is real, that it wasn’t properly addressed, and that this failure registered with the public.The leadership failed to defend itself on foreign policy issues. Surely it should have been possible to condemn the murderous folly of the Iraq war, the atrocities of the Saudi onslaught on Yemen, or the injustice of Israel’s occupation of Palestine, without also ineptly questioning the truth of Russia’s involvement in the Salisbury poisoning. That single episode inflicted terrible damage on Corbyn – and for what?Then there is the election itself. The campaign lacked any coherent narrative. When, before the manifesto launch, I asked a senior Labour official if it contained a clear vision, they replied “ish”. It was reminiscent of Oprah Winfrey shouting at her lucky audience, “You get a car! You get a car!” Each day a new policy was randomly thrown into the ether. The Tories had relentless message discipline. Labour’s offer felt bewildering, and as a consequence, unbelievable.If we are going to be honest in self-criticism, we must not draw false conclusions either. Claims that Labour suddenly lost working-class communities don’t engage with the fact that the party had a lead over the Tories among the working-age population – and a greater lead among those aged under 45 than Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide. It is among pensioners that Labour has become a fringe party: here is where its focus must now lie – without abandoning the progressive social values that are articles of faith to its young supporters.The tragedy of today’s left is that a political opening emerged when its only viable figureheads are either survivors of past struggles, or charismatic young fighters who are not in a position to become leaders. As the party’s former policy chief Andrew Fisher points out, a generation of being consigned to the wilderness meant the left had few experienced bureaucrats and organisers, particularly to navigate a hostile environment: that, at least, has changed now.Labour’s defeat was a calamity for the party and those it exists to represent. Corbyn’s leadership was partly destroyed by Brexit, by the remorseless attacks of its internal and external opponents, and by its own severe mistakes. Any new left project must learn from all of this. But from public ownership to tax justice to investment, it was not its signature policies that condemned it – and those ideas must remain at the core of whatever comes next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e98461eff4a208ead5b109513dba66f4fc1b2f5/0_0_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6641082765fab49676b3f708ec681a96","title":"home office spouse visas hostile environment","story":"On 28 November 2017, I burst into tears in the middle of a coffee shop after I learned that my spouse visa had been rejected by the Home Office. My lawyer had warned me that this would be the most likely outcome but it still felt like a punch in the stomach. I was being rejected by the country where I had spent the past seven years, although I was happily married to one of its citizens.I first arrived in the UK in 2010, aged 16 and on a child student visa, hoping to start a new life. My old life in Chechnya had broken into pieces the day my mother, a human rights activist, was kidnapped outside our house and murdered. With the support of my mum’s friends and colleagues, I moved to the UK, as she had wanted me to. In the following years I finished school, graduated from the London School of Economics and married the love of my life.I was 22, he was 24, Brexit had just happened, my visa was running out, so tying the knot seemed like the most sensible (and romantic) option. But we learned soon enough that love and human rights concerns were not enough for the Home Office to grant a visa. How naive we were.Our lawyer suggested that we should apply for a spouse visa via the human rights route. My three-kilo stack of visa documents included letters of support from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Front Line Defenders, saying it would be unsafe for me to return to Chechnya. My situation was complicated by the fact that half of my Chechen family disowned me for marrying a foreigner. We also didn’t meet the financial requirements, as my husband was completing his MA at the time, but we tried to find our way around it.There had been a supreme court ruling that upheld the minimum income requirement but condemned the Home Office for endangering the welfare of children it stated that third-party support should be considered when evaluating an applicant’s financial circumstances.My father-in-law was happy to be a third-party sponsor. He drew up a legally binding contract, promising to pay the minimum monthly income requirement. He even had himself audited and his house valued to prove that he could afford to continue the payments.In an attempt to meet the required income, my husband got a part-time job as a salesman for a tech company while doing his studies I was serving tables at an Italian restaurant (I could only legally work for 20 hours a week). For one and a half years, my life was constrained by the fact that my only form of ID, my Russian passport, was at the Home Office – I couldn’t leave the country, register at a hotel or even buy a pair of scissors.Eventually the Home Office claimed I hadn’t provided sufficient proof that I spoke a good level of English, seemingly forgetting I had finished school and graduated from university. It followed up with a few terse sentences, noting I had failed the financial requirements and that it wouldn’t consider third-party support – without any explanation of that decision.The Home Office saw no reason why my husband and I couldn’t settle in Russia – despite human rights organisations arguing that our lives might be at risk. That the Home Office appears to think it’s OK to tell citizens they should live somewhere else if they want to be with the one they love is a scandal in its own right.We appealed, our lawyer explaining that when similar cases go to appeal they are likely be overturned. Yet at £4,000 plus legal fees and no guarantee of success, this filters out many applicants by default. My husband got a job meeting the minimum requirements straight after graduation – but it would take six months before it would count – so we played the system: every request for information, every submission, drawn out to the last possible moment, hoping that the six months would pass before a tribunal date arrived. We made it, and finally after two years of uncertainty and stress, I received my two-and-a-half-year spousal visa.Despite the inconvenience and constant stress, I always remind myself how lucky I was to be able to stay by my husband’s side and rely on the kindness and generosity of my in-laws. When I was searching through immigration forums I came across devastating stories of “Skype families”, children separated from their parents, husbands from their wives because of these rules. We were lucky we could afford a lawyer who knew how to navigate Home Office bureaucracy, which feels like it is designed to trip you up.Battling the Home Office made me think that it’s occupied not by iniduals with feelings and emotions but by a primitive AI without empathy or discretion. But hostile environment policies were designed by people. They are calculated to keep immigration at bay, no matter the cost to people’s lives. The Windrush scandal is a case in point.Immigrants do far more for the UK than the UK does for them. They contribute their skills and invest in the economy, pay taxes and generally make this country a more interesting to live in. It is up to all of us, no matter our citizenship status, to stand in solidarity with migrants and resist whatever the next five years of Tory government brings.• Lana Estemirova is a graduate in international relations from the London School of Economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96b88ea5be7c0e53f51143548e3a6d21b6003c4/0_60_3042_1825/master/3042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c65f64ed30ba101181fff3af7f5402b","title":"the guardian view on brexit transition a safety valve not a trap","story":"At the start of the election campaign, Boris Johnson promised to “end the groundhoggery of Brexit”. By this he meant the sensation of being trapped in a loop, condemned to repeat the same story, desperate to escape a repetitive present and begin the future. The appeal of such an escape to millions of people was confirmed in last week’s general election result. There is no disputing the government’s mandate to “get Brexit done”, even if the terms on which it is done remain negotiable.With that negotiation in mind, the prime minister plans to amend his EU withdrawal bill with more robust Brexit intent. The intention is to explicitly prohibit any extension to transitional arrangements that are due to expire at the end of next year. This is meant to signal Mr Johnson’s determination that the UK’s break with Europe will be swift and total.Given that complex free trade agreements can take up to a decade to complete, the expectation that one can be negotiated in less than 12 months is silly. Without a longer transition, the UK will face a new cliff-edge this time next year, similar to the one it faced when there was a credible prospect of crashing out of the EU with no deal at all. This is real “groundhoggery”, sending the country back into a cycle of fraught negotiations against a ticking clock. It is a dynamic that favours the bigger and better-prepared side of the table in trade talks, which is not the one on which Mr Johnson will be sitting.It is never a good idea to use legislation as a form of political advertising. Statutes should serve practical governing purposes, while Mr Johnson’s symbolic anti-transition clause makes good government harder. There could be compelling economic or diplomatic reasons for wanting more time to finalise trade talks. Having just won a healthy majority, Mr Johnson can afford to give himself options.The preference for limiting those options betrays a misconception of Brexit. Many Tories brush aside the legal significance of the formal 31 January exit date. They imply that transition blurs the distinction between membership and non-membership that Brexit itself will not be a reality until more severe rupture is achieved.This is a dangerous mistake. The article 50 phase of talks gave the UK privileges in talks with Brussels that it will not have as a “third country”. Once formal membership has expired, British leverage shrinks. Barriers for ratifying agreement are raised. Mr Johnson is in a hurry to be seen slamming the EU door behind him, unaware of how cold it will feel outside. Transition is not a trap to prevent the UK pursuing an independent trade policy it is a mechanism to allow both sides time to develop a mutually beneficial arrangement. Cutting it prematurely short increases the likelihood of souring that relationship. It raises the probability of Britain rushing into a bad deal to avoid the disruption that would accompany failure to reach a deal at all – a repetition of the dynamic that brought Mr Johnson to complete his substandard withdrawal agreement in October.The prime minister is obliged by politics and pride to pretend that the deal he struck is a great one. He imagines he can achieve another such triumph in the next phase of Brexit in the same way. Having learned nothing from the article 50 process, he intends to lead the UK into more brinkmanship with Brussels, ignoring the relative strengths of the two sides, and pretending that bombast can compensate for a lack of technical preparation. It cannot. If Mr Johnson does not change his strategy he will wake up in his very own Brexit Groundhog Day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf85e9477d9fca1044365cf5e4b9ff082aeebbc6/0_0_941_568/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c3f5bad307fa3cb08fb5f0bc880fead 685w","title":"jimmy kimmel letter nancy pelosi","story":"Late-night hosts marked the eve before a likely House vote on impeachment by unpacking Trump’s angry six-page missiveOn the eve of the House’s likely vote to pass articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Jimmy Kimmel looked at the case of two documents. The first, released Monday, was a 658-page report by the House Judiciary Committee detailing the president’s misdeeds. “Who’s gonna read that?” Kimmel asked. “You expect the American public to read a 658-page anything? We can’t even catch up on our TV shows.”The second was a six-page letter Trump wrote to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, in which the president “takes zero responsibility for his impeachment”, Kimmel summarized. “Of course, he says the same thing about Eric and Donald Jr.”The six pages decrying the impeachment process “might be the most deranged letter to Santa ever”, Kimmel continued. “It is a long, stupid, disingenuous and incoherent defense signed by an angry gorilla with a Sharpie.”The House will almost definitely pass the articles of impeachment this week, sending them to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial, which Kimmel said will be a “joke”, since Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell already rejected Democrats’ request for witnesses this week. “He wants a no-witness trial. He also said he’ll be running the trial in close coordination with the White House – that seems fair,” Kimmel panned. “Let the guy on trial run it. Perfect.”On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated “impeachment eve” with a close reading of Trump’s letter to Pelosi. Prior to Tuesday, Trump had been relatively quiet about impeachment, Colbert said, “but the pressure clearly was building under the surface because this afternoon, the lid blew off Mt St Yellin’. The eruption came in the form of a six-page shriek addressed to Nancy Pelosi”.The letter was full of anger toward Pelosi, including some choice quotes such as: “Your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America’s founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build.”“Yes,” Colbert responded, “a nation built on the belief that powerful white men face no consequences whatsoever.”Colbert called the letter “a disorienting mishmash of dry legal language mixed in with Trump’s signature angry word smoothies. For example: ‘the articles of impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognizable under any standard constitutional theory, interpretation, or jurisprudence … You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!’”“Happy now, Nancy?” Colbert asked. “You’ve cheapened something very ugly. That goes against everything Trump stands for – making very ugly things extremely expensive.”Trump also blamed the impeachment process on Democrats’ bitterness from the election loss in 2016 and accused Pelosi of viewing “democracy as your enemy!” Colbert, imitating the president, clarified: “Whereas I view democracy as a friend with benefits, because under me democracy is so screwed.”Trump also wrote that “more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials”.“You know what? I agree with the president on this one,” Colbert said. “Fair is fair – we should throw him in the river.”Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he took “zero” responsibility for impeachment, which means, according to Colbert, “he takes foreign assistance, he takes daddy’s handouts, he takes a handful of any women who wanders into the grope zone, but he draws the line at responsibility”.Seth Meyers also addressed Trump’s letter on Late Night, in which the president said the impeachment inquiry was full of “shameless lies and deception” – “which is true, it’s called evidence,” Meyers retorted.“This letter is bonkers,” he continued. “I don’t even know how to describe the tone of it. I guess if you took the most privileged white lady ever and gave her a whole bottle of wine, and then asked her to write Yelp review of a restaurant that made her wait 40 minutes for a table and then got her order wrong twice.”Meanwhile, Trump’s re-election campaign is reportedly set to spend $400,000 on anti-impeachment ads this week, “which seems unnecessary when the best anti-impeachment ad has an office down the hall,” Meyers said next to a photo of Mike Pence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c216fa1dc757905bd6a3d2e51106dcc8b81e9b7c/0_326_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19edbe1c140abd863e8f1a73147f4dbd","title":"how to revise without ruining christmas by exam experts","story":"The spectre of January exams can quash the holiday spirit, but these tips will help students prepare while leaving time to unwindThere’s nothing quite so effective at quashing the Christmas holiday spirit as the spectre of January exams. But if you get organised, plan your exam prep and follow our tips from revision experts, you’ll be ready to ace your tests while still making time for some all-important relaxing. Here are the best revision methods.One of the most effective ideas is to rewrite your notes and say things out loud, according to Carina Cunha of tutoring firm Crimson Education. “Rewriting your notes can help trigger your memory,” she says. “It can also help you organise the material better, making your notes easier to understand and absorb. It’s beneficial to then read them aloud – you are more likely to remember something this way than you would by reading the material in your head.”Sian Duffin, student support manager at Arden University, helps students deal with revision and exam stress. “Look at how effectively you are using your time,” she advises. “Figure out when you are most productive and plan your study around that – is it in the morning or at night? Is it for longer periods of time or short bursts with more breaks?”Make yourself a realistic revision timetable. There’s no point setting up a packed 7am-to-midnight learning schedule with a five-minute break for two meals: you’ll soon feel overwhelmed and give up. In my first year of uni, I used my old school timetable as a model for my revision time: it meant learning for 40-minute chunks, with regular breaks and an hour off for lunch, as well as time off in the afternoon to properly relax and get outside for some fresh air. Alternatively, there are lots of sample timetables to download online. Don’t forget to build in mini-rewards for each time you hit a target like learning a chapter of a textbook – I found chocolate to be a pretty useful learning incentive.“Diagrams work well when studying for anatomy or biology exams, and you are trying to memorise a process or a set of relationships,” says Cunha. The nature of revision means you’ll need to work solo some of the time, but partnering with a friend who works in a similar way to you can help you to reinforce learning and test each other. Sites like Quizlet can be useful: you can make your own flashcards, mini-tests and even games to help you to learn facts. You can also access some 300m study sets created by other students on topics stretching from film and graphic design to science, economics, and languages.Stick revision notes on your bathroom mirror, by the kettle, or near the loo. Not only does it give you lots of reminders, it can also help you in exams – you’ll think “Ah! The secretions of the liver ... that was on the mirror …’Previous years’ exam papers are a brilliant resource, but Valentine warns students to avoid trying to anticipate which topics will come up. She explains: “It may well be possible to figure out patterns from past questions if you look long enough, but it’s definitely not the most effective way to spend revision time. Relying too heavily on clues can end up with students getting caught out in the exam hall.”Try an app like Offtime or another digital detoxers – it blocks texts and notifications, restricts access to apps and will even limit your phone usage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71aa34afe1e6787da523acafdd15e79338189dbd/0_1721_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8009713af1db256abebc812f6c719f5","title":"no need to shop for teachers christmas gift unless it is wine survey says","story":"A homemade card will do for most – but primary teachers wouldn’t say no to boozeParents in a last-minute panic about Christmas gifts for their children’s teachers don’t need to worry: most teachers say the present they’d prefer is a homemade card – although primary school teachers would be just as happy with booze.With most schools in England closing for the Christmas holidays on Friday, an anonymous survey of more than 5,000 UK teachers conducted by the Teacher Tapp app revealed teachers would rather receive homemade cards from their pupils than the traditional offerings of wine or chocolate or other gifts.The exception, though, are teachers in primary schools, who were as likely to say they’d prefer wine as a painstakingly-drawn felt-tip and glitter Santa from Year 1.The popularity of a student’s own work over the sinful attractions of free alcohol and confectionary shows that teachers really are soft-hearted, even at secondary school, according to Becky Allen, Teacher Tapp’s co-founder and chief analyst.“Primary school teachers probably get blasé about getting homemade cards, whereas by secondary school it doesn’t happen as much, so it’s a real bonus to have the kids saying something meaningful about you,” said Allen.For those intent on giving chocolates – favoured by just one in six teachers - Terry’s Chocolate Orange topped the national popularity stakes, while Roses and Quality Street were the least popular.The relative popularity of Christmas gifts is one of the more unusual results uncovered by Teacher Tapp, an app dedicated to finding out what teachers think and how they do their job on a daily basis.The results have been eye-opening, according to Allen, an honorary research fellow at Oxford University’s department of education, in revealing the long and often unproductive hours teachers work, and how lonely the job can often be.“We’ve found that teachers spread their working day over really long hours. Many of them take a break after leaving school, either because they have got caring duties or they are exhausted, frankly,” Allen said.“They go home and then they start working again in the evening. We found that four in 10 teachers in any weekday evening are sitting in front of the TV doing their marking.“Psychologically, it can feel quite a burden to do a job where you feel like you are working from first thing in the morning, until the last thing you do before you go to bed is work.“You’ve got this infinite job, you don’t work as part of a team so you have to make your own decisions how to manage your workload, and that’s really hard for anyone to do.”Ironically, teachers themselves agree that marking books is often a waste of time – the educational researcher Prof Dylan Wiliam’s calls marking “one of the most expensive PR exercises in history”.“If you ever say to a headteacher, you could just drop the marking policy, they would be absolutely horrified. But there’s no rule that says you have to have one. But things get culturally embedded and then it’s hard to turn back,” Allen said.Allen and Laura McInerney, another former teacher and  education columnist, came up with the idea of Teacher Tapp in 2017, attracting seed funding to create the app that now has a dedicated user base of 6,000 teachers around the country answering the three or four brief questions sent each afternoon.In doing so Teacher Tapp has created a community of teachers who share the same profession but often have little contact with those outside their immediate area, even within their own schools.One of the saddest results uncovered by Teacher Tapp has been the substantial number of teachers who preferred to eat their lunch – often as short as 30 or 45 minutes a day – in their classrooms or offices, away from their colleagues.Allen says such responses have led her to think about the loneliness of teaching, “how isolating it is, how little teachers actually know about each other and the job they do.“Teachers don’t all hang out in the staffroom together as much as they used to, and fewer collegial conversations are taking place. It does mean that quite a lot of the dysfunction in schools comes from relative isolation and lack of understanding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb79af094e313a56ab181fe8608333f8a41a908/1_0_2561_1536/master/2561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e404ef3b4f5fd623b10aa3ba1cff6cb6","title":"scrooge is not an option how to dress to add some much needed christmas cheer","story":"’Tis the season to be jolly. I know, I know. Santa has some seriously heavy lifting to do, because never has the most magical time of the year been more desperately needed. Christmas is a care package of cinnamon baked goods and Baileys, timed to land at the moment when the world outside is at its darkest and coldest and most unwelcoming. And if ever a midwinter could do with a mood lift, it’s this one.The second Thursday in December is usually when the party season gets going, but this time around, the hangover kicked in before the fun. Mood plummeting, nausea rising: the election result was about as Christmassy as the scene in Gremlins when Phoebe Cates’s Kate explains how she found out Santa didn’t exist. (If you don’t know this scene, promise me you won’t look it up.)Being sentimental and schmaltzy by nature, I absolutely love Christmas, with its month-long licence to indulge those traits. But even if that’s not you, festive cheer is a three-line whip this year. Scrooge is not an option, frankly. We all owe it to our fellow humans to be as Christmassy as possible. That means wishing merry Christmas to every single bus driver and not taking the hideous cracker hat off the moment you think no one is looking. For Christmas magic to work, you need to believe in it.Being Christmassy in 2019 can feel complicated. The families who aren’t fractured and frazzled by arguments are worn down by collective hand-wringing. Brexit has politicised nostalgic ideas of Britishness, making the lamplit-snowy-cobblestones, rosy-cheeked Victoriana we associate with Christmas feel loaded. And while that referendum has a lot to answer for – not to mention the general election – they are not the only issues. The call for sustainability has taken the feelgood factor away from turbocharged shopping sprees. Even traditional Christmas cooking feels a bit out of sync with the zeitgeist: a turkey you can barely fit in the oven, plus sausages wrapped in bacon, isn’t going to work when half the family have gone veggie or vegan.So, as John Lennon sang about Christmas in 1971, let’s hope it’s a good one. We’ve still got gingerbread houses and Mariah Carey. We’ve got ice-skating, panto and seeing Christmas trees being carried home in nets. Gavin and Stacey. Some Christmas traditions are getting bigger every year. Advent calendars were once only for kids and were, in any case, just a picture of a reindeer behind a paper door. They are now marketed at grownups and filled with gin or luxury eye cream. Front door wreaths, which used to be for posh hotels or people with too much time on their hands, are everywhere.And it wouldn’t be Christmas without getting dressed up. The phrase “party season” makes December sound like a choreographed procession of sparkly red carpet moments that, even in jollier years, didn’t quite chime with reality. The reality, of course, being an endless round of emoji-heavy WhatsApp debates about which pub is more likely to have a table for 9pm on a Friday. But Christmas itself is worth getting dressing up for, whether you are on the tiles or on the sofa.This year, a tuxedo-style jacket has replaced the little black dress as the centre of gravity for your December wardrobe. Fashion has been very covered-up for the past couple of years, and when you have been in a polo neck and midiskirt for months, spaghetti-strap sequins are a big step out of the comfort zone. A tuxedo jacket turns your favourite black trousers and a silk camisole or blouse into instant black tie. (See Victoria Beckham’s Instagram feed for a masterclass on this look.)Lucinda Chambers and Serena Hood, ex-Vogue editors and the founders of the new tastemaking edit Collagerie, have an eye for a high street treasure – they have trawled Arket and Maisons du Monde for the best affordable pieces – but are not recommending a supermarket sweep for a whole new set of Christmas decorations, however temptingly inexpensive. “Buy one decoration a year – that way, your collection is really meaningful,” says Chambers.With this month’s Vogue cover starring Taylor Swift in an archive Chanel jacket – a landmark disruptive moment in the history of the fashion magazine as a shop window – glamour that doesn’t come with a side-order of landfill-guilt is a crucial element in the feelgood factor, which is what Christmas is all about.This week may not feel full to the brim with festive cheer. But chin up, buttercup. Like Roald Dahl said, those who don’t believe in magic never find it. This year your Christmas needs you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3733e88750456035ed8dedff21b3e5fa6b5af67a/0_89_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9e1192324bae50e2932c8f71ab5bc8","title":"adam driver walk out interview npr fresh air voice","story":"Actor reportedly walked out of NPR’s Fresh Air rather than sit through a clip of himself singing a song from movieAdam Driver really does not like to listen to the sound of his own voice. In the middle of an interview on the NPR program Fresh Air earlier this month, the actor reportedly walked out rather than sitting through a clip of himself singing a song from the recent movie Marriage Story.Driver, who also appears in the new Star Wars film, left the New York studio abruptly during a remote interview with the show’s longtime host Terry Gross, Fresh Air’s executive producer Danny Miller confirmed to the Daily Beast. The producers of the show were aware that Driver preferred not to listen to or watch his own work – he told Gross as much in a previous interview – and said they encouraged him to remove his headphones, an offer that apparently irked him.“I don’t want to hear the bad acting that probably was happening during that clip,” Driver told Gross in the previous interview from 2015.“I’ve watched myself or listened to myself before, then always hate it,” he said. “And then wish I could change it, but you can’t. And I think I have, like, a tendency to try to make things better or drive myself and the other people around me crazy with the things I wanted to change or I wish I could change.”A New Yorker piece from October touched on what they called Driver’s “phobia” as well. In the story Driver recalled watching himself on Girls for the first time and recoiling.“That’s when I was, like, I can’t watch myself in things. I certainly can’t watch this if we’re going to continue doing it,” he said. Driver recalled hating seeing a scene of his in the film Inside Llewyn Davis and said he stopped watching altogether until the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”“I just went totally cold,” he said, “because I knew the scene was coming up where I had to kill Han Solo, and people were, like, hyperventilating when the title came up, and I felt like I had to puke.”Many actors have expressed a similar displeasure with or refusal to watch their own work, including Johnny Depp, Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie and others, so Driver’s reaction is not out of the ordinary.Many other people outside of acting often register surprise or disappointment when they hear their own voices played back to them as well. The reasons for this are complicated ranging from a difference in the acoustic quality of the sound when it’s not being conducted through our own bodies, or various extra-linguistic cues, such as anxiety level, that only become apparent to the speaker when their voices are played back.“We don’t really understand why he left,” Fresh Air’s Miller told the Daily Beast. “We were looking forward to the interview. Terry thinks he’s a terrific actor, he was a great guest when he was on in 2015, so we were disappointed that we didn’t have a new interview to share with our listeners about Marriage Story.”Earlier this year Driver said he had a technique for avoiding watching his own films at movie premieres. Speaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Driver said: ‘‘I just go into a room and wait with a guy in silence, and then I got to go back and sneak in and pretend like I was there the whole time. It always seems like a better alternative than watching all the mistakes that you’re making that are now immortalised on film.’’Driver is not alone in avoiding watching his own films. Julianne Moore once has said that “I haven’t seen any of my movies”. Reese Witherspoon says watching her own movies would make her “spiral into a state of self-hate”. “I don’t know who feels good looking at themselves. Nobody, right?” Witherspoon said on Chelsea Lately. “It’s torture. Why would you want to watch yourself being stupid and pretending to be somebody else?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/764c4ad076482981ef00d363bbd2d8c2e53035f5/0_1306_8348_5008/master/8348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=038df95d7eb71f274329417549a68c5e","title":"how make perfect gougeres cheese puffs felicity cloake recipe","story":"A simple choux pastry mixed with gruyère, parmesan or cheddar, these fancily named cheese puffs are perfect Christmas fareGougères, as we sophisticates call cheese puffs, are “the world’s best canapé” – not my words, but those of Niki Segnit, while Elisabeth Luard reckons they’re “the perfect partner” for the wines of their home region, Burgundy. “Take the cork out of the bottle – there’s just time for it to breathe while you cook the gougère. You will never have a better chance for drinking it,” she promises.American chef Thomas Keller nails it for me, however, when he calls gougères “basic and delicious” – because, despite the fancy name, they are indeed pretty basic: a simple choux pastry that can be made weeks in advance, and baked to featherlight perfection straight from the freezer. Perfect Christmas fare, whenever you eat them.Choux pastry, the same one that’s used to make profiteroles, sounds more complicated than it is: in fact, it requires very little in the way of skill, though an understanding of the process is helpful. Water is heated with butter until the latter has melted, then flour is beaten in to create a paste. This beating not only brings the mixture together, but activates the gluten in the flour, making the dough stronger and stretchier (helpful for rising), while the heat dries it out and denatures the proteins, so they’re not so elastic that they immediately snap back into shape. Eggs are beaten in to emulsify the dough, the yolks adding softness, the whites strength, followed by cheese or other flavourings, before the choux is piped or spooned on to trays and put into a hot oven, where the remaining moisture evaporates and expands, causing the buns to rise and dry out, until eventually you’re left with a crisp shell of savoury dough. That’s the theory as I understand it, anyway.Nicole Kaplan’s gougères at New York’s Eleven Madison Park were described by Jonathan Reynolds in the New York Times as: “a gossamer of gruyere so light that it can be brought to your table by a butterfly and evaporates on your tongue seconds after making contact – leaving behind only the sound and memory of a thin crunch, the nutty aroma of milk’s leap toward immortality, and a child-like impatience for more.” Kaplan uses strong bread flour to achieve this, which, according to Segnit’s Lateral Cooking, will help make the dough stretch further. But we find, in amateur hands at least, that it also makes it slightly tougher, putting us in mind of cheesy dough balls, rather than featherlight gougères.Judy Joo uses a mixture of milk and water in Korean Food Made Simple which gives a better flavour, but a softer finish. Given the amount of cheese that goes in, I don’t think this dough needs much help on the flavour front, but a little crispness is very welcome, so I’m going to stick with the plain water variety. Bear in mind that you want the dough to be as dry as possible, so don’t be afraid of overcooking it once you put it back on the heat. It’s also wise to let it cool a little before adding the egg, to reduce the risk of the latter scrambling.Gruyere is the classic choice: in his book, Egg, Michael Ruhlman says there is a feeling that, “because they are a French preparation, one should use only a French cheese … I say it’s fine to add a little parmesan to the mix, and cheddar would surely work as well”. I try grana padano and mature cheddar, and can confirm that both work well, as indeed would just about any hard cheese (mimolette, red leicester or Scottish red cheddar would give good colour). But for that distinctive, sweet-salty flavour, gruyere or another mountain cheese would be my pick every time – and, as Hopkinson observes in Simon Hopkinson Cooks, “the better quality the cheese, the more delicious the gougères”.You don’t need anything more than salt, but a gougère is improved immeasurably by a good pinch of mustard powder, which Segnit calls the “unsurpassable flavour enhancer” when it comes to cheese. Joo also adds Korean chilli flakes, which is a good call if you’re looking for a touch of spice (Kaplan’s cayenne pepper does much the same job), while Hopkinson and Willan go big on the nutmeg, which I always think pairs particularly well with gruyere and its ilk.Finishing with a quick brush of egg and a sprinkle of cheese will give your gougères a glorious tan: if you run out of either, however, it’s not the end of the world.Though it’s not necessary to wield a piping bag – you’ll be pleased to know Hopkinson deploys two wetted spoons – it will yield more even results. Keller’s Bouchon Bakery book calls for the gougères to be frozen in silicone moulds, “to ensure they are uniform” if you have them, use them, but they’re certainly not necessary for anyone but the most serious control freaks. (Joo’s batter is so very wet that I have to put hers into them, so they do come in useful, after all, turning out delicious, almost quiche-like results – not classic gougères, perhaps, but that doesn’t stop us all scoffing them.)Kaplan gives three tips for success to the New York Times: refrigerate or freeze the dough after piping, because “it will rise better in the oven”, eat them immediately – “like topical plays, they lose value every couple of minutes” – and, most importantly, “if you’re serving them to friends, make millions”. Having baked a batch of the same dough immediately, after refrigeration and straight from the freezer, I don’t notice a great deal of difference, though the frozen ones are perhaps slightly puffier. So … up to you, but Kaplan’s right on the millions thing: people can really put these things away. (For this reason, I prefer them bite-sized, though you can make them larger, if you wish just adjust the cooking time accordingly.)As the moisture evaporates, the little buns will rise, creating a cavity in the middle if there’s too much liquid in there, however, they’ll collapse (which is only a disaster for your pride they’ll still taste fabulous). To facilitate this process, like Keller, I’d advise starting them off in a hot oven to drive off as much water as possible, and then turning the heat down so the outsides don’t overcook before the middle has dried out, taking a tip from David Lebovitz and cutting a hole in the shell to let the steam out in the final five minutes. That said, I rather like a bit of squish in the centre, so you might want to play around with the timings until you find your own sweet spot.To reheat ready-cooked ones (hey, you might have leftovers, you never know), put them into an 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 oven for five minutes.250ml water80g butter, cubed½-1 tsp fine salt5 large eggs150g plain flour, whisked¼ tsp freshly ground nutmeg (optional)2 tsp mustard powder (optional)175g gruyere or other hard cheese, gratedLine two baking sheets and, if you’re cooking immediately, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Put the water, butter and salt in a medium pan over a medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to help melt the butter. Meanwhile, crack four of the eggs into a jug and beat together.Take the pan off the heat and pour in the flour, stirring until it comes together into a paste. Put back on a low heat, and stir until you have a smooth ball and the dough is starting to form a layer on the base of the pan – this should take two to three minutes.Take off the heat and use a stand mixer or hand beaters to beat the dough for about five minutes, until cooled.Beat in the four eggs little by little, making sure each addition is well incorporated before adding the next, then stir in the nutmeg, mustard powder and four-fifths of the cheese.Dab a little of the mixture on the bottom corners of the baking paper to stick it to the trays, then pipe or spoon walnut-sized blobs on to the paper, spacing them out well.If baking immediately, whisk together the last egg with a dash of water or milk, then brush on to the buns, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and put them in the oven. (If you’re not cooking them at once, chill the trays overnight or freeze for up to a month, and bake from frozen as below.) Turn down the heat straight away to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 and bake for 20 minutes, then pierce the side of each one with a small knife and put back in the oven for five minutes to let the steam out, before removing and devouring while they’re still warm.• Cheese puffs or gougères: whatever you call them, are they the best party food ever, or would you make an argument for straws, pinwheels, or something else entirely? And if not cheese, what else do you flavour them with?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205ec3c4b08ebc72ca829f45fcfe0b7bac4e9766/0_29_4597_2759/master/4597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b10e62877eaa79e1ff8a0dfe8ad654f8","title":"arsenal mikel arteta manager manchester city","story":"Mikel Arteta’s lawyers are holding final talks with Arsenal to conclude a deal for him to take the manager’s job after Pep Guardiola accepted his assistant’s wish to leave Manchester City.Arteta, who has been offered a long-term contract, believed to be until 2023, is in line at Arsenal to replace Unai Emery, who was sacked on 29 November, and take the reins from the caretaker, Freddie Ljungberg.

The Club World Cup semi-final proved a headache for the European champions against Monterrey but Roberto Firmino came off the bench to convert a stoppage-time winner and set up a final encounter with his fellow Brazilians of Flamengo on Saturday. Jürgen Klopp’s men go to the end regardless of the prize at stake.The importance of the competition was writ large on the devastated faces of the Monterrey players after Firmino tapped home an inviting cross from fellow substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold to seal a slender and difficult victory. Liverpool were disrupted by illness and injury but left in no doubt they will have to up their game considerably to claim the trophy for the first time in their history this weekend.This threatened to be an awkward assignment for the Liverpool manager from the outset. His concerns over a pitch that had staged two other games in the previous 24 hours were unfounded – 18 ground-staff were on hand to tidy an immaculate surface following the warm-up and at half-time – but selecting a defence to play on it proved problematic.Monterrey (3-4-2-1)Barovero Montes (Layún 79), Sánchez, Vangioni (booked) Medina, Rodriguez, Ortiz, Gallardo (booked) Pabón (Meza 82), Pizarro (J González 90) Funes Mori Subs not used:\u0026nbspGutiérrez, Mejia, Urretaviscaya, Zaldívar, Basanta, A González, Cárdenas, Vásquez, Reséndez\u0026nbspLiverpool (4-3-3)Alisson Milner (Alexander-Arnold 75), Gomez (booked), Henderson, Robertson Oxlade‑Chamberlain, Lallana, Keïta Salah, Origi\u0026nbsp(Firmino 85), Shaqiri\u0026nbsp(Mané 68) Subs not used:\u0026nbspAdrián, Lonergan, Jones, WilliamsVirgil van Dijk was confined to his hotel room by illness and, with Dejan Lovren and Joël Matip already sidelined through injury, Joe Gomez was the only central defender available. It fell to Jordan Henderson to partner Gomez in the heart of an all-British backline in which James Milner also replaced the rested Trent Alexander-Arnold. Teething troubles were inevitable, and Monterrey broke through too easily on several occasions in the first half, but Liverpool’s control of possession restricted the pressure on their makeshift defence.The semi-final played out amid a strange atmosphere. One small pocket of Mexican supporters made an incessant noise while the rest of the stadium was subdued until the ball arrived in the vicinity of Mohamed Salah. The Egypt captain was determined to ensure his personal fanbase would be richly entertained.Salah superbly crafted the breakthrough when he took possession from Milner with his back to goal and his man marker for the night, Leonel Vangioni, in close attendance. He not only held off the Monterrey defender but had the awareness to spot Naby Keïta’s darting run behind Nicolás Sánchez and thread a superb reverse pass into the path of the midfielder. Keïta provided the touch that Salah’s work deserved and beat goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero with an emphatic finish.Keïta’s runs from deep troubled Monterrey throughout but Liverpool had no time to settle on their early lead. The Mexican side were level within two minutes as the European champions struggled to deal with a free-kick conceded by Milner’s foul on Rodolfo Pizarro. The set-piece was delivered to the corner of the Liverpool penalty box where Stefan Medina towered above Keïta to head into the danger area. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain cleared only as far as Sánchez, whose overhead kick caught a teammate flush in the face but teed up Jesus Gallardo for a left-foot volley that Alisson pushed away. But straight to Rogelio Funes Mori, and the former Everton defender’s twin made no mistake from close range.Alisson prevented Funes Mori scoring again when getting a vital touch on a cross from Dorlan Pabón that was destined for the unmarked striker at the back post without his intervention. The Liverpool keeper also saved at full stretch from Pabón as Monterrey prospered in the space that Van Dijk would normally protect. His absence was felt.Liverpool continued to dominate possession, however, and were close to retaking the lead when Salah carved open the Mexican defence once more. This time it was a backheel to Milner that bamboozled Monterrey, although Barovero was equal to the veteran’s shot from a tight angle. Monterrey’s keeper enjoyed an influential game. He denied Keïta a second goal when the midfielder ghosted into the area and attempted to round the keeper. In the second half the Guinea international weaved his way past two defenders inside the area but Barovero blocked a powerful drive with his chest.Klopp switched to 4-2-3-1 after the interval with Salah as the focal point of the Liverpool attack. It brought more cohesion to Liverpool’s play but they remained vulnerable to Monterrey’s pace and the strength of Funes Mori. Alisson saved twice in two minutes from Pabón and again when Funes Mori tried to catch him out with a snap-shot from 30 yards. Pabón also missed a decent opening at the end of an attack that had Monterrey appealing in vain for a penalty when Milner prevented Pizarro connecting with a header at the far post. They wanted a red card for Gomez too when the defender, already booked for hauling down Funes Mori as they chased a ball over the top, was penalised for handball. Antonio Mohamed’s protestations provoked a furious reaction from Klopp who left his technical area to berate the Monterrey coach for appealing for a dismissal. Both managers continued to exchange barbs and were shown yellow cards.Klopp introduced the insurance policy of Sadio Mané, Alexander-Arnold and Firmino in an attempt to seal victory inside 90 minutes. It paid idends in the first minute of stoppage time when Alexander-Arnold swept an intelligent cross to the near post after good work by Salah and Firmino tucked the winner beyond Barovero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8613f12941a543cb58444093d68bc6a25ddc3037/0_202_3151_1891/master/3151.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c19d746ac14ef5650b16ac5299e0852","title":"barcelona real madrid la liga live","story":"80 min A double change for Real Madrid: Rodrygo and Luka Modric replace Isco and Fede Valverde.

Just as Barcelona’s three yellow cards told the story of the first half, so Real’s three tell the story of the last 10 minutes.76 min Real Madrid were so dominant for so long, but it is starting to feel like they are hanging on for a point. Barcelona have been so much better since the introduction of Arturo Vidal.74 min After a frantic counter-attack from Barcelona, Suarez whacks a curler high and wide from the left side of the area.NO GOAL! Yes, the offside decision stands.They are checking the offside but I am pretty sure Mendy was offside.73 min: BALE HAS A GOAL DISALLOWED FOR OFFSIDE! It’s the right decision, just about. Mendy was a fraction offside when he ran onto a crossfield pass and cushioned a volley across goal for Bale to score from close range.72 min A neat lay-off from Suarez finds de Jong, who surges forward and hits a low drive from 20 yards that is comfortably saved by Courtois.71 min “Thanks for throwing the rule book in my face, Rob,” says Colin Chamberlain. “You do invite musings to be emailed to you, remember?”70 min Bale is booked for a late tackle on Griezmann.68 min: Good chance for Bale! Valverde slalomed infield from the right, all the way to the edge of the box. After his first attempted pass was blocked, Valverde poked the loose ball through to Bale in space on the left side of the area. He allowed the ball to run across his body and lashed a rising drive that rippled the side netting at the near post. He should have done better.67 min “You HAD to link to that a Ronaldo header, didn’t you?” says Matt Dony. “I’m still scarred by a similarly towering header he put away a few summers ago. Still, on a vaguely related note, very happy to see Bale playing for Madrid. Should he score the winner, I’m sure many things will be forgiven.”Based on your emails during the MBM, I’m surprised you can remember anything about that night.66 min Casemiro is booked for a foul on Suarez. Barcelona are having their best attacking spell of the game.65 min A very deep cross from the right is headed off the outside of the near post by Benzema. It’s not as dramatic as it sounds: ter Stegen had it covered and watched it all the way.64 min Griezmann has a snapshot blocked and Madrid break dangerously, only for Benzema to play a poor ball to Valverde. 61 min A couple of points on that double chance. Had Messi scored, it might have been disallowed for an accidental handball by Griezmann in the build-up and I think Suarez had miskicked before Ramos challenged him, though it’s hard to be sure.It was in the same attack as the Messi miss, so presumably the Griezmann handball would still have been a factor. I’ll level with you: I haven’t a clue about the laws these days.60 min: Lionel Messi turns into a pub player! What a miss that was. He was found by Griezmann’s low cross, eight yards from goal, but he miskicked the ball completely. A few seconds later, Sergio Ramos made a desperate last-ditch tackle to deny Luis Suarez. At first look I thought it was a penalty the referee did not.57 min “So if it’s on tele why do people follow it on the computer?” sniffs Colin Chamberlain. “A barca is a boat in Spanish. FC Barcelona’s nickname is Barça in Catalan.”1. As you’ll doubtless know if you’ve read the  football website at any point in the past 20 years, we don’t do MBMs of games unless they are on TV. 2.

Barcelona are being battered 0-0.53 min “I’m interested in this game, if that helps,” says Mac Millings, although quite why  thinks people are interested in Colin Chamberlain’s opinion is beyond me. I’m calling that personal attack a ‘tactical foul’ by the way, but only to annoy Stephen Carr.” 52 min Another long spell of possession from Real. It’s been a while since they’ve dominated like this at the Camp Nou.50 min Messi skedaddles thrillingly from centre to left before driving a low cross that is cleared a split-second before reaching Griezmann.49 min Bale is flattened by Lenglet, a clear foul that the referee can’t be bothered to give. That was a bit odd. Apparently Arturo Vidal is warming up for Barcelona, which is no surprise given the way Real dominated the midfield in the first half.47 min The impressive Isco wins an early corner for Madrid. It’s headed away by Pique, who has been Barcelona’s rock so far.46 min Peep peep! Barcelona begin the second half.“The amount of space that Barca’s pressing leaves is a cause for concern,” says Hrishabh Narayan. “Roberto playing RM but finding it hard to cast off the right-back in him. Needs to be forward more and a little more centre. For he has always made a difference with those diagonal through runs.”“Why do  think people are interested in this,” says Colin Chamberlain. “Everton are playing Leicester City in the League Cup 14 final. By the way, in Spain they are known as Madrid, not Real.”Well, the Everton game isn’t on TV, so there’s that. There’s also a developing - if controversial - school of thought that people in all countries are interested in the most glamorous fixture in world football.“I’m petitioning Uefa to introduce mandatory yellow cards for use of the term ‘tactical foul’,” says Stephen Carr.This one will run and run. Until somebody stops it with a tactical foul.“I’m late to the play,” says Charles Antaki. “Just settling into my seat for the end of Act I of the Panto, and it seems that Sergio Ramos is still on the pitch. Theatre just isn’t what it used to be.” He’s setting a new record for clasico appearances tonight. I suppose we all hoped he would behave accordingly, but he hasn’t tried to maim anyone yet.Peep peep! Both teams had attempts cleared off the line in a relatively subdued first half. Madrid have been the better team and should probably be ahead, with Barcelona struggling to get control of the midfield. For once, the story of the half can be told in the number of bookings: Barcelona 3-0 Madrid. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.45 min Lenglet is booked for a cynical foul on the breaking Isco. Just before that, Suarez’s cushioned volley across the six-yard box took a vital deflection off Mendy, with Messi waiting behind him to score.44 min Another sweetly struck long-range volley from Valverde is well saved by ter Stegen, falling to his right.43 min “Hey Rob,” says Neil McGwyre. “Just watching that video of Ronaldo nutting that header home made me think that he might have a future in Aussie rules when he decides there are no more worlds to conquer on the association football scene. The ability to get up like that and take a mark is a much-revered talent and would have him on many an end-of-season highlights reel. If he’d like to a grow a mullet and get many more tattoos then he can only increase his chances. I’m quite sure he’d also be fond of the very short shorts and the sleeveless tops to show off his guns.”41 min: Jordi Alba misses a great chance! Messi played an exquisite chip over the defence, right into the path of Alba’s run, but his sidefooted volley from eight yards bobbled just wide of the far post.40 min Suarez reminds everyone he’s on the field by giving the assistant referee an unmerited bollocking and then, seconds later, getting himself booked for a foul on Casemiro.37 min Kroos, given far too much space 25 yards from goal, shoots well wide. Barcelona look really vulnerable in midfield Sergio Busquets is having a marvellous game.35 min Barcelona are having plenty of possession now, but Real still look the more dangerous side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96065990f582966cb355c1516a8d3616e42c584/148_0_4044_2427/master/4044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91e5561916dc289234fd5c6f755dc3f8","title":"liverpool monterrey club world cup semi final live","story":"That’s all for now.

Very poor marking by Monterrey as it’s played to Lallana before falling to Origi, who pounds it into the back of the goal. Alas, the flag is up as the Belgian was about five yards offside.58 min: Moments after Keita’s effort, Gomez is shown yellow for a late challenge on Funes Mori, who appeals to the referee that he was free on goal. 57 min: It’s another self-created chance for Keita, who’s been so close twice in addition to his early opener, but Barovero is there to make the save at point-blank range.55 min: Another nifty backheel by Salah on the edge of the area to find Milner in stride, but it’s well-covered by the Monterrey defense and kicked out for a Liverpool corner, which quickly fizzles out to nothing.52 min: Another shot by the industrious Pabon, another save by the in-form Allison. Monterrey rapping away on the door early in the second half, giving the European champions a headache at the back.50 min: Monterrey win a free kick and Pabon’s thunderbolt from range demands yet another highlight-reel save by Allison, who’s been excellent today. Liverpool are quick on the counterattack, but imprecise in the final third before returning possession to Monterrey.48 min: Origi darts down the left flank and finds Salah in the area, but the Liverpool star can’t get a shot off. The ball falls to Robertson, but his shot is blasted over the crossbar.47 min: Vangioni is first into the book, shown yellow after catching Shaqiri late. He’d escaped punishment for an even harsher challenge on Salah in the opening minutes.46 min: And we’re off in the second half with Liverpool kicking off attacking from left to right. No changes for either side, it appears, though Salah has shifted into the middle with Origi on the left and Shaqiri on the right.A quick spot of half-time reading, with a nod to Liverpool’s visit to Qatar.An entertaining opening 45 minutes with brisk two-way action and plenty of chances on both ends. Liverpool are winning the possession battle while Monterrey have generated the better opportunities, showing they can take a punch with their rapid response to Keita’s early opening. Plenty more to come from Khalifa International Stadium!45 min: The fourth official signals for one minute of added time. 43 min: Keita nearly makes it two on the day after he’s released by Oxlade-Chamberlain but Barovero is off his line in time for the easy save.40 min: The European champions have dominated possession but Monterrey have created the better chances through high pressure and timely counterattacking against a somewhat patched-together Liverpool backline.37 min: Monterrey nearly take the lead (again) after a quick counterattack through the middle aided by a false step by Jordan Henderson into the midfield. Pabon surges down the right flank and plays it to the far post, but Allison darts off his line and makes a fingertip save with his outstretched right hand. Monterrey have been so very dangerous in transition today.33 min: An awful giveaway by Sanchez, whose pocket is picked by Salah in Monterrey’s own half. But the Argentine center back recovers nicely and prevents a scoring chance with a clean last-ditch tackle.30 min: Monterrey win a free kick after an overzealous challenge by Joe Gomez and they’ll look to build up from the back. Which they do, expeditiously. But Gallardo’s effort from a step outside the area soars over the crossbar. 27 min: Monterrey have been positive and inspired in attack tonight even if they don’t have the quantity of chances to show for it. Here Gallardo takes a touch too many before he’s dispossessed in the midfield. But moments later Keita gives it away carelessly and Pabon sends a cracking shot to the far post that’s erted only by a fully extended Allison. A great save.23 min: Salah with another sublime backheel on the right flank to free Milner in the area but a well-positioned Barovero is there to make the save.20 min: Harsh assessment from the gallery.18 min: Milner is down after a fairly violent collision with Gallardo, who arrived late. But he’s up, walking around and it appears he will stay on. Play resumes with Monterrey still in their high press.And Monterrey have equalized! Alisson makes a hair-trigger save of a Gallardo shot after poor clearance of a free kick, but Funes Mori is perfectly positioned to tap in the rebound. Game on!12 min: The Liga MX standard-bearers are undeterred with Pabon nearly scoring mere seconds after the restart.Milner plays to Salah’s feet and the Liverpool star ides the defense with a gorgeous reverse pass behind Sanchez and Montes. An excellent finish by Keita makes it 1-0.9 min: The free kick is played short to Shaqiri but the possession fizzles out and Monterrey look to counter quickly with a ball over the top – not the first time the Mexican side have tried the direct route behind the Liverpool back line. Allison is there to clear it.8 min: A very strong challenge from behind on Mo Salah by Leonel Vangioni and Liverpool will have a free kick from inside the Monterrey half.4 min: Crisp two-way pace to start off. Henderson is playing the left center back position for Liverpool with Gomez on the right. Liverpool have the first decent chance of the night as Shaqiri cuts back just outside the area but sends a shot wide of the target.1 min: And we’re off! Liverpool attacking from right to left in all-red kits, Monterrey from left to right in white-and-blue striped shirts with blue shorts. Last night’s first semi-final between Flamengo and Al-Hilal drew an announced attendance of 21,588. A bit of a fuller crowd for tonight’s match but far from a sellout of the 48,000-seat Khalifa International Stadium, it appears.About 10 minutes from kickoff. A big ovation for crowd favorite Mo Salah when he emerged from the tunnel for warm-ups. A quick look at the inbox as the Khalifa International Stadium slowly fills. Here’s a question from Peter Oh.Is Monterrey’s Funes Mori the same Funes Mori formerly of Everton? (I’m trying to find any dash of spice to liven up my appetite for this match.)Monterrey’s Rogelio Funes Mori is the twin brother of the departed Everton defender Ramiro, who did quite a number on Liverpool’s Divock Origi a few years back. Unless of course we’re getting Parent Trap’d.Jürgen Klopp has made five changes from the side that beat Watford on Saturday to maintain their 10-point lead atop the Premier League table. The big change comes in the heart of the defense where skipper Jordan Henderson will pair with Joe Gomez. Adam Lallana, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will come into the midfield while James Milner takes over at right back with Robertson moving over to the left side.Hello and welcome to Qatar for today’s second Club World Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Monterrey. The European champions are back in action for the second time in as many days after enlisting a youth team for yesterday’s 5-0 defeat to Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup, which dashed their quintuple hopes. But a far more familiar cast is on call today as the Reds enter directly into the semi-final stage to face the Concacaf Champions League winners, who advanced with a 3-2 win over host nation representatives Al Sadd on Saturday.Should Liverpool survive today’s test as expected, they’ll advance to Saturday’s final against South American champions Flamengo, who came from behind to see off Saudi side Al-Hilal in yesterday’s first semi-final.More to come directly, including the just-in team sheets, with kickoff roughly 45 minutes away.Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Jürgen Klopp’s thoughts on his team’s campaign:Jürgen Klopp has said Fifa’s scheduling of the Club World Cup undermines respect for the competition but Liverpool did not “fly 3,000 miles not to show up” in Qatar.Liverpool’s attempt to win the tournament for the first time begins with Wednesday’s semi-final in Doha against Monterrey, the Concacaf Champions League winners from Mexico. Whereas the Club World Cup has a passionate following in Latin and South America – as evidenced by the thousands of Flamengo fans who have travelled to the Gulf state from Brazil – it has struggled to generate the same esteem within European football.Klopp believes the decision to stage the competition in the middle of the European season is one factor. He said proposals for an expanded 24-team Club World Cup from the summer of 2021 – days after the Champions League final and potentially clashing with the Nations League, Africa Cup of Nations and the Concacaf Gold Cup – would not help the competition’s prestige.“I can’t talk about respect in England but we are here now and completely focused,” the Liverpool manager said. “If, however, you asked me if there should be a Club World Cup in the middle of our season, I would say no. We are here so, for us, it is the most important competition in the world. But can it be bigger? I don’t know. Fifa plans a team World Cup in the summer but it is the summer when the African competition is playing and others as well.”You can read the full article here:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29bda48dbb1b49566fd497318a10e43ae85e3fdc/0_40_4215_2530/master/4215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95a6f6c55d1ce614c31efa19f8606040","title":"oxford united manchester city carabao cup quarter final live","story":"45+2 mins: Angelino ends the half by driving in something that might be a terrible cross or an even worse shot, from wide on the left. It’s half-time, City have created little and they hold a slightly fortunate lead.45 mins: They go for a cross, and again Brannagan overhits a set piece. Dickie just about keeps it in, but is offside.45 mins: Ruffels does cross this time, and it’s a pretty good one. City half-clear, but then Mahrez fouls Taylor and Oxford will have a chance to shoot or cross.42 mins: Oxford break in numbers. City have defenders on hand to track the runners, and after carrying the ball to within 30 yards of goal Taylor decides a long-range shot would be a better bet than a pass through to, say, Fosu, and spears an effort well over the bar.39 mins: Shot! Mahrez picks up the ball on the right, cuts into the area, cuts back onto his right foot and then sends a shot towards the near post. Archer pretty clearly fingertipped it onto the outside of the post, but it’ll be a goal kick.35 mins: Ruffels gets the ball in a decent position on the left wing for Oxford, but instead of driving into the box, or crossing with his left foot, he checks back onto his right, passes the ball back 40 yards, the ball goes back again to a centre-back, and the attack is over.32 mins: Chance for City! Bernardo Silva plays Sterling in, and he lifts the ball over the advancing Archer, but it goes well wide.30 mins: Leicester have scored a second, Jonny Evans heading in a corner. Manchester United v Colchester remains goalless.29 mins: In one of the night’s two other Carabao Cup tie, James Maddison has given Leicester a 1-0 lead at Everton.25 mins: That is all a bit harsh. Oxford had played pretty well, threatened occasionally and defended excellently, and to go behind to a deflected shot will hurt. But they did give Cancelo an outlandish amount of space on City’s right flank.Mahrez moves infield, leaving a ludicrous amount of space on the right wing for Cancelo to burst into. Burst into it he does, and he keeps bursting until he reaches the Oxford penalty area. He does in the end run out of space and ideas, and so lashes in a shot from an unpromising angle, which takes a convenient deflection off Moore, floats past Archer and in!21 mins: Oxford send the goal kick back with interest, and Fosu wins a corner. Brannagan very nearly sends this one over everybody and out for a goal-kick as well, and though it’s eventually kept in they can’t make anything of it.20 mins: A bit of pressure from Oxford, who after a decent start had fallen onto the back foot. Fosu wins a free-kick out on the left wing, and Brannagan lifts it over everybody and out for a goal-kick.18 mins: Ooof! Sterling gets the ball on the edge of the area, but there’s no shot on so he lifts it to Mahrez to his right. He volleys the ball across goal and Sterling would have had a tap-in but for Dickie’s alertness and his excellent clearance, when he could well have sent it into his own net.16 mins: Sterling has the ball in the net, but the offside flag is up, the whistle has blown and everybody else has stopped playing. A replay suggests it was a very tight call.14 mins: A nice move from City ends with Angelino on the left, but his run is tracked and his cross deflected out for a corner, which is eventually cleared.12 mins: City are yet to make their superiority tell, or even to make it particularly evident. Foden surges down the left, but is forced to turn back, and the ball is eventually turned over.9 mins: A pass over the defence sends Sterling sprinting, but the only way past Dickie is by pulling his shirt, and Oxford get a free-kick. 8 mins: Angelino takes on Sam Long on the left. The ball ends up deflecting out off Long’s fist, but the referee gives a goal kick.6 mins: Sterling lifts his shot over the wall, over the goal and into the fans, who cheer uproariously.6 mins: Sterling is fouled by Gorrin, 30 yards or so from goal. Shot incoming.4 mins: Oxford now break forward, and win the first corner of the game. It’s headed clear.2 mins: Angelino’s cross from the left is a little overstrong, and Mahrez can’t bring it under his spell. Oxford clear.1 min: Peeeeeeep! Manchester City get the game started.Not silence, applause. Oxford’s fans stand and clap, and then the referee blows his whistle and they give a final roar. Kick-off time!There will be a minute’s silence before kick-off for Jim Smith, the former Oxford manager.And out they come! It’s windy and rainy, but Oxford might need more levellers than that. Action imminent.The players are in the tunnel! It looks a bit cramped in there, so they’ll be keen to get going.Karl Robinson has a chat about Oxford’s prospects this evening. In brief: not great.You always have a puncher’s chance. Not a strong one. Listen, you can stand here and say you have a great chance or a rubbish chance. The gulf between the teams is glaringly obvious but we enjoy the challenge and embrace the opportunity to play against one of the best teams in the land. This is going to be as difficult as it gets. The way we try to play, we have a big pitch, a nice pitch, a flat pitch, and for once this season it probably isn’t going to work in our favour.Mikel Arteta, as confirmed by Pep Guardiola yesterday, is in Oxford this evening. If the pictures are anything to go by, he seems to have a lot on his mind.Here are the teams again, this time in purely textual form.The team sheets are in! City have an inexperienced central defence, composed as it is of 17-year-old Taylor Harwood-Bellis and 18-year-old Eric García (both have birthdays next month). The rest of the team, though, is pretty familiar. As rumoured, the returning Oleksandr Zinchenko and Angelino both play.Manchester City’s two previous line-ups in this competition have been, from Oxford’s perspective at least, distressingly strong. Claudio Bravo has started in goal each time, though a 36-year-old with three league winners’ medals and a Champions League to his name can hardly be considered gauche, while 18-year-old Eric García played both games at centre-back – one alongside Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who is only 17 – and the similarly youthful midfielder Tommy Doyle got a start in the 3-1 home win against Southampton in the fourth round. Otherwise is has been first-teamers all the way, and two straightforward victories – they were 3-0 up at half-time against Preston in the first, 2-0 at half-time against the Saints in the second. Going a little further back, they won 3-0 at the Kassam Stadium last September, a game so one-sided that the home side had no shots on target and only one of any type, to City’s 18. It was probably unnecessary for the Oxford manager, Karl Robinson, to warn fans not to “expect us to come out of the traps to be all energy and dominating”, even if his side have only lost once in the last three months (though that was on Saturday, at MK Dons).Still, where there’s life there’s hope. “People might laugh at me, but I believe we can win. I’m not just saying that,” says Oxford’s Cameron Brannagan. “We’ll go into the game confident and with the ability we’ve got we can hurt anyone. At the end of the day it’s you versus him. The price tag might be a bit different and they might get a little bit more money than we do, but that’s it, there’s nothing else in it. I honestly believe we can do it.”Time will tell, and not much of it either. Let’s share it together, shall we? In the meantime here’s Ben Fisher’s preview:When Oxford United and Manchester City collide on Wednesday, entertainment is unlikely to be in short supply. In the manager’s office at the League One club’s Kassam Stadium, the E-word is the buzzword as Karl Robinson explains how he is looking forward to a reunion with Pep Guardiola, this time in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals.Only West Brom and Peterborough have outscored Oxford in the Football League this season and, in the top flight, only Leicester, Liverpool and City have a healthier goals-for tally. Oxford have not found the net in their past three matches but perhaps they are keeping their powder dry.You can read the rest by clicking here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22a766bccf16d93cf04b44b299879f1ef562ced1/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e7c3a34a053c293dca24e2806ae0e9b6","title":"my father paid four times his weekly wage for the greatest gift of my life","story":"He bought me and my brother – both of us blind – a tape recorder that dominated Christmas Day and the remainder of the holidays, and led to a long and happy careerIt’s eight o’clock on Christmas morning, and Uncle Tom wants to hear the news. My 11-year-old self is wondering why on earth grownups want to hear the news on Christmas Day when there are vital things to be done, such as handing out presents. And then, while I am only half-listening, something weird happens: the Greenwich time pips start. Surely we have already heard those. And then the boring man with the plummy voice begins going on about a Christmas message to the world from the Vatican. Surely that’s been on already, too.It’s my older brother, Colin, who gets it! “Pete, Pete, it’s a tape recorder, you idiot! We’ve got our tape recorder.”The penny drops: Uncle Tom and my dad have recorded the headlines, and are playing them back.I think it’s often quite rare to experience real excitement over a present: in my experience, children are as good as adults at knowing what is expected of them and simulating joyful surprise, even when they don’t feel it. But for me this was one of those rare moments when my insides gave an involuntary lurch and the world did a little somersault.Colin and I had both been blind from birth, and at this point were spending most of our time at a special boarding school, Worcester College for the Blind (now called New College Worcester). In the late 1950s, Britain had just reached the point when exciting consumer goods were coming within reach of the not-really-rich, and at Worcester reel-to-reel tape recorders were definitely the consumer gizmos of choice. For blind kids, they would trump cameras every time, especially at this moment when rock’n’roll was more of a religion than a pastime. For us, you could spot the better-off kids not by the clothes they wore, or the holidays they boasted about, but by the tape recorders they owned. So in our class, Iain Hopkin was marked out as something of a plutocrat by his Brenell recorder. Fortunately for us, Hoppy was a generous soul, and gave us all access to his recordings of Tony Hancock and Peter Sellers.Still, a recorder of your own was the height of aspiration, and Colin – better informed and more realistic about family finances than me – had no real expectations.I realised, much later, that at this time my dad, a very good joiner and carpenter, was probably earning about £8 a week. The tape recorder my parents had bought us, although nowhere near at the top of the range, would have cost more than four times his weekly wage. My parents could only afford it by borrowing the money from Uncle Tom, who had a thriving grocery business. Family or not, I know my mum and dad would have thought long and hard before incurring the debt.The new toy, mains-powered and the size of a small suitcase, dominated the rest of Christmas Day and the remainder of the holidays. Once we had mastered the controls (Colin was the technical one, but was surprisingly patient in sharing his discoveries with me), we recorded everything in sight: each other, our parents, the milkman, the dog … And we very quickly learned the fun to be had at catching people unawares.Uncle Tom, at whose house we were staying over the holiday, got an early reward for his generous loan. Some friends he regarded as a little pretentious were coming over for Boxing Day my aunt and uncle always referred to the husband as “the mayor of Romford”. (Whether that was because he was or just talked as if he was, I’m not sure I ever learned.) Uncle Tom was keen Bill should be made to listen to his chirpy cockney accent, which he claimed he didn’t have. (Things like this mattered 60 years ago.) My task was to record them when they arrived and then at a quiet moment play it back to set Bill straight. Delighted to be trusted in this adult conspiracy of inverted snobbery, I set the machine going as they came up the path. The reaction was more than Uncle Tom could have hoped for I think he decided at that point that his £30-odd investment had already been more than repaid.It wasn’t the first time I had been entranced by a tape recorder. I vividly remember, aged four, coming into a room and hearing a child singing, tunelessly, and raucously. I stopped dead. “It’s you,” Dad said. “Noisy, aren’t you?” I didn’t understand. It turned out that he’d borrowed a tape recorder because he and some friends were writing and performing songs and sketches for his former school’s annual concert. And so for the first time, in the same way that a sighted child might react to seeing themselves in a mirror or a photograph, I got the sense of myself as a separate person, existing outside my head and experienced by other people. It was exciting and embarrassing – not a bad summing-up of my later life as a broadcaster.I really took my first steps down that path when I got back to school after the holidays ended. I was lucky to be in a class of imaginative and creative boys (yes, sadly, Worcester was single-sex then) and it wasn’t long before – all of us radio-obsessed – we started to make our own embryo radio programmes. While studio managers at the BBC were still banging coconuts together to represent horses’ hooves, we were using the little oblong pieces of lead we needed to represent numbers when doing sums to recreate shrapnel for our first world war battles. And very effective they were, dropped on to a desk from a great height.Meanwhile, I would wander round the school with my rudimentary microphone, commenting in the voices of my radio idols – the hushed, reverential tones of Richard Dimbleby, the gravel-voiced war correspondent René Cutforth, and, favourite of all, the mellow Hampshire burr of John Arlott.Most of what I described was pure imagination, although occasionally we would stage real events to heighten the excitement. Particularly memorable was a boxing match between Mick and Geoff (respectively the strongest and the gamest boys in the class, both totally blind. The commentary came from the only one of us with a little bit of sight, in a very passable imitation of the boxing commentator Raymond Glendenning). The strong boy beat the game boy, by the way.The acquisition of the tape recorder coincided with the formation of our own band: Reg Webb, Andy Woods and – yes – Peter White, imaginatively called the W Brothers and destined to be the greatest group ever, had not the Beatles come along and pinched our best material. Reg and Andy were good musicians, and went on to have professional careers. I wasn’t in their musical class, but made up for it with what I thought at the time was my witty banter to introduce our songs. At one of our concerts a girl actually screamed – although it could have been that someone trod on her foot.In fact, the biggest challenge was not finding things to do with the tape recorder but wrestling it away from Colin – it was, after all, a joint present. His generosity on the first day we got it did not extend to his handing it over to his ham-fisted brother at school. I can still hear the phrases: “You’ll break it you’ll lose it you’ll scramble up all the tapes.” And, annoyingly, I did do all of those things. On one fraught occasion, trying in front of an open window to disentangle the hopelessly knotted tape that contained my latest radio gem, I managed to get yards of the stuff enmeshed in an overhanging tree.But 10 years later, by which time I had begun and abandoned a university law course, it was the confidence gained from those early excursions into sound that had me walking into the local radio station in Southampton, trying to sell myself as the next Robin Day. It all nearly ended there, as the receptionist told me there were no vacancies, and that I’d have to apply to the BBC in London “through the normal channels”.Luck intervened. A producer charged with putting together a weekly programme for blind people saw me and my white cane being ushered into the lift. As I prepared to hitchhike my disillusioned way back to university, he rang me at home, and asked if I would go back to Southampton to see him.Twenty-five years after that, I presented my first report for BBC TV’s Six O’Clock News, a date with the telly my dad had never missed. Although by then he’d been dead for more than a decade, I like to think he’d have realised that his inspired Christmas present really had not just changed, but shaped my life.Peter White is the BBC’s disability affairs correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3e8552caf80226a3acc3b93a785826294ec916/0_0_4830_2897/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6b8f0bb385fae486bc838a419dcf6ac","title":"the seven most terrifying christmas traditions around the world","story":"Playful Christmas fun, or sinister, skin-crawling horror? You decideIn most English-speaking countries, the worst fate a naughty child can expect on Christmas is an absence of gifts (or, in the US, coal). Children in other countries, however, can expect worse.Here are seven of the creepiest Christmas traditions around the world.In many European countries, Saint Nicholas has companions who act as a negative counterpart. Saint Nick is the benevolent Good Cop you do not want to meet the Bad Cop.One particularly bad cop is Krampus, a demonic half-goat monster with horns and a long tongue. He drags chains behind him as he walks and rattles them ominously. He carries a birch to whip bad children and sometimes a basket or sack for kidnapping them.The Eve of St Nicholas, 5 December, is Krampusnacht. Hordes of Krampuses march through Alpine towns in elaborate, sinister costumes. In recent years, the Krampuses’ tendency to go on drunken rampages, getting in fights and destroying property, has become a bit of a problem.Frau Perchta is a witch who comes to see who has been naughty or nice. She slits the bellies of bad children and stuffs their corpses with straw. It’s sort of like Santa bringing coal, but with disembowelment instead.Imagine: it is New Year’s Eve. You are a small Welsh child. You hear a knock on the door. You open it. Looming over you is a creature with a horse’s skull, wearing a long, billowing cloak and trailed by people chanting. In the horse’s eye cavities are fake eyeballs. Its mouth is slightly ajar. You are paralyzed in terror.As you wet yourself in fear, adults around you wish each other happy new year.Gryla is a giant ogre who lives in a cave. During Christmas she emerges to hunt for children, which she kidnaps, takes to her cave, and cooks in a vat of stew.Gryla has a variety of companions, including the Yule Lads – her 13 unruly troll childrenLarge Adult Sons – and the Jólakötturinn, or Yule Cat.Did you think that the Yule Cat sits on your lap as you open gifts, playing with the wrapping paper and contributing to the overall atmosphere of cozy Christmas hygge? Wrong. The Yule Cat is terrifying.Like Satan, walking among us like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, the massive Yule Cat lopes through town in the dark, peering into the lighted windows of children’s bedrooms. The only way to save yourself from being eaten is to show him that you got clothes for Christmas because you were good this year. If you didn’t get any new clothes, you leave out old clothes, and hope to God they meet his standards.According to Alsatian lore, Hans Trapp was a local man renowned for his greed and unscrupulousness. He used witchcraft and deals with the Devil to become rich. After being excommunicated from the Catholic church, he lost his wealth and social standing. He took to roaming the countryside disguised as a scarecrow.At some point, Hans Trapp became consumed with the idea of tasting human flesh. He lured a shepherd boy to his death, then cooked him over a fire. Before Hans Trapp could take his first bite, however, God – finally feeling that things had gone too far – struck him with lightning.Hans Trapp died, but he returns sometimes on Christmas, to go from door to door looking for young, tasty children.The Kallikantzari are goblins who spend most of the year underground, trying to bring about the apocalypse. During Advent they come out on to human territory to cause mischief and evil. They are sometimes described as black furry creatures with tusks and horns. They are usually male, and grotesquely well endowed.Père Fouettard was a butcher. He and his wife kidnapped, robbed and killed wealthy children, then carved up their bodies and hid them in salting barrels. Saint Nicholas discovered the crime and brought the children back to life. As punishment, he forced Père Fouettard into bondage as his eternal cannibal manservant. He follows St Nick around, dealing with the problem children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d5d9ac2d1eee194e4a7e4bcf896a3a6f7d97fd0/0_0_1405_843/master/1405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c163ec4578f955086a59321693804ee4","title":"adult friendships can be effortful and elastic thats what makes them special","story":"Pressures of family, marriage and work tend to splinter cliques that sustained us earlier in life, but what remains is just as rich“I never had friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone?”The final line of Stand By Me, the classic film about four boys who share everything one summer in the 1950s, comes from the main character as man in his late 30s.We see Gordy hunched in his home study over his computer, with thinning hair and a swelling paunch, ruminating on a time when his days were filled by his three best friends and their endless, circular conversations, excoriating humour and life-and-death adventures. Grown-up Gordy isn’t shown talking to anyone outside his family any more.The movie is one of my all-time favourites, first watched on VHS as a 12-year-old at a sleepover surrounded by my own inseparable group of girlfriends in the late 90s.That last line always stuck with me, as both a coda to the story, but also as a warning.What it said was that deep, fortifying, true friendship is for the young. Getting older, especially crossing into your 30s and beyond, means forgoing all that intimacy and connection, at least with people outside your family or your marriage.Nostalgia for the close friendships of our youth is very real. Studies show the number of close friends we have begins to drop from the age of 25 as work and relationships take hold, people move cities and countries, and the cliques that once sustained us fall apart. The disrupted modern job market and the way our cities are increasingly designed makes maintaining close human relationships difficult.I’ve felt these shifts and exasperations in my life, and yet I also think the pessimism of my youth was misplaced.I haven’t seen most of the girls at that sleepover since the summer after our HSC when the group splintered as the thing holding us together – high school – came to an abrupt end.But I held on to one, my best friend, with whom I’ve shared a home at different times, innumerable heartaches, family dramas, hospital trips, arguments, beach days, texts, drinks, and long periods of time apart.Nevertheless, in different forms, the relationship endures.There is no tight clique any more. In my experience the adult posses of Sex and the City and Friends are as unrealistic as the giant New York apartments. Instead there’s a shifting medley of people – some in clusters, some as iniduals who orbit my life, coming into view only once or twice a year – who I nonetheless value enormously.There is a lot of elasticity in these relationships. They can stretch, occasionally go slack, sadly, but often they snap back better than you might think.Those bonds seem to naturally strengthen depending on the other forces in your life. My sister tells me she has gravitated towards a couple of her oldest friends after nearly a decade when they all had their first babies. “We are so sympathetic to our shared experiences,” she says. Likewise, by the time you’re in your 30s, not having children, and exploring what adulthood might look like without them, can be just as bonding.My sleepover friends all had surnames that started with the letter T, V or W – classes in year seven were organised alphabetically so something as random as your surname largely dictated who you became friends with. My childhood best friend lived around the corner.Adult friendships outside the workplace or your kids’ school pick-ups, at least, can rarely rely on incidental interactions. That makes them hard. They require conscious effort – but that deliberateness can make them feel more special.In my experience technology has aided friendships at this age more than it has diminished them.Groupchats at their best are filled with casual intimacies and in-jokes, bearing witness to each others’ lives in small ways, hanging out, even when we’re busy.I’ve made real friends online too. Having some guy slide into your DMs when its sleazy and unwelcome is the bane of many women’s lives. But a slide from a woman you think is cool, who wants to get coffee? That makes all the hellacious interactions worthwhile (almost).And while texting and commenting on each others’ posts can be flippant, it also keeps bonds simmering as the opportunities to spend time together diminish.While living overseas for three years, I found even the smallest interactions through social media and messaging apps kept us in each others’ lives, allowing many of the relationships to spring back to life more easily on my return.“Friendship is a relationship with no strings attached except the ones you choose to tie, one that’s just about being there, as best as you can,” wrote Julie Beck in the Atlantic in 2015, in an essay charting shifting friendships through adulthood.I never had friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12 – but now they’re all people I truly chose, and who I keep choosing to share my life with, however we can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc78cee7e6c6faa146ab128d35285e61a5e577e6/0_1262_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cdc542d4c5c6366ef6658688f30c91","title":"howd you like them apples how the science of sleep is helping british apple farmers thrive","story":"Apple author James Rich learns how British growers are using new technology to keep us in perfect pommes all year round Our love affair with them runs far deeper than the apple-a-day proverb further than just something to nourish and keep us healthy – although they are packed with vitamins A and C, magnesium and fibre.They represent fertility in some cultures, wealth and health in others, knowledge, and some of our most celebrated discoveries (hello, gravity). They have permeated culture history, religion, science and technology to be a familiar and reassuring constant in our everyday lives. Quite simply, the apple is more than just a fruit. In fact, Brits buy more than 34,500 tonnes of apples each year (roughly 2.2m apples a week) at Tesco alone.And British apples are some of the best. In the UK, we have the ideal climate and weather to grow perfect pommes. Not only do we have the perfect growing conditions, but our apple growers are some of the most advanced in the world the British apple industry pushes innovation, using the latest technology and equipment to ensure only the tastiest of fruits.Growers include the family owned Adrian Scripps in Kent, which has been specialising in growing “top fruit” (meaning apples and pears) in the garden of England since the 1960s – and has supplied Tesco for more than 30 years. Working with Adrian Scripps, Tesco became the first supermarket to sell British apples all year.Managing director James Simpson explains: “We grow British apples to fill the shelves all year round: gala, discovery, braeburn, kanzi, red prince, jazz …”But apples are a seasonal fruit eating apples especially have a growing season approximately eight-weeks long, generally in September and October. Still, we’ve grown to expect them in our fruit bowls all year round. How do we bridge the gap?Simpson explains that technological advancements mean that British apples can be kept fresh for as long as eight months from the time of picking – stored from September or October right through to May or even June.To do this, the fruit is housed in cold stores (think giant fridges) holding hundreds of tonnes of apples. Here, Simpson and his team can control the atmosphere that the apples are kept in, specifically the natural gases.“The air we breathe is predominantly oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen,” he explains. “By lowering the oxygen level in the air, we can slow down the ripening process that the apples would otherwise go through.“Reducing the oxygen levels, which will ripen the fruit, and increasing nitrogen, which slows down the ripening process, sends the apples in to a dormant state – a form of deep sleep.”This process, which sounds like something straight out of Snow White, is called dynamic controlled atmosphere – a natural process to safely store the fruit until they are ready to be eaten. Simpson likens it to the maturing of cheeses or wines.“The number one priority for us is the eating experience for our customers ensuring we keep the flavour and crisp bite in the apples is the major focus to growers – creating the tastiest, ripest British fruit,” Simpson adds.This also means rotating the varieties on offer. “We work with Tesco to ensure that only the best of the season’s apples are on their shelves at any one time,” says Simpson. “This will change depending on which apple varieties are at their peak at any given time moving from the discovery, which is a more delicate apple and has a shorter store life, early in the season, through to the braeburn, which is hardier and can be stored for longer, later in the season.”Ensuring optimum taste isn’t only about seasonality it’s also about meeting customers’ changing tastes. Tesco sells approximately 50 British apple varieties, introducing new varieties each year, which is where John Worth, Tesco’s master of apples (no less) comes in. Together, Worth and Simpson trial and introduce new varieties of apple – taking up to five years to perfect a flavour.“Right now, customers are looking for great flavour and juiciness, combined with a satisfying crunch as they bite into it,” says Worth on the latest apple created with Simpson. “This meant crossing crisp, modern varieties with the flavour of older varieties. Working with James and his team, the result was the red prince variety: its flavour and texture are enhanced as the natural sugars and acids mature in storage, resulting in a wonderful crispness.”Of course, we can still buy apples from all over the world, but with our expectation for local produce continuing to rise and the need to reduce our global food footprint being more vital than ever, homegrown champions such as Adrian Scripps are defining what shoppers want – filling our baskets with a British bounty of the all-important, and not-so-forbidden fruit.As well as supporting its suppliers in implementing new techniques to enhance freshness, Tesco has an in-house “sensory panel” to help growers across all its fresh food in developing new, flavoursome varieties that taste great and thrive in British climes.

Four suits, four pairs of shoes, 14 shirts and a bag full of colourful ties had disappeared, along with several boxes of private documents.Jones, a Corbyn critic who had been expected to hold on to his Lancashire seat of nine years, said the discovery added an extra layer of pathos to an already difficult few days.“It was a bit of a shock. I had moved most of my clothes to my office before the election so I had easy access to them for work.“There were some of my favourite suits, silk ties, blue, pink and red ties among them. Half of my clothes were clean and half were ready for the wash. But it would have been nice to keep them,” he told the .After quizzing parliamentary staff, Jones learned his personal belongings had been destroyed because staff mistakenly believed that his office belonged to the retiring MP Jim Cunningham, whose room was next door. He did not know if they had been incinerated or thrown out.Sitting MPs who lose in an election are given five days to clear their offices to make way for the new incumbents. Retiring MPs were told to clear their rooms before the election or risk having their belongings thrown away.“I don’t blame the staff. They are under a lot or pressure from the management to clear the offices quickly. In this case they may have done it a little too quickly,” said Jones, who has been offered compensation for the loss of his belongings.Of the 73 sitting MPs to lose seats in this election, 46 were Labour, seven Conservative and six Liberal Democrat.Other former MPs have complained that House of Commons authorities have piled unreasonable pressure on them to quickly vacate the building so close to Christmas.Liz McInnes, the former Labour shadow foreign affairs spokesperson whose constituency of Heywood and Middleton was also part of the “red wall” of northern seats that turned Tory last week, said the parliamentary authorities should give former MPs more leeway to cut their ties with Westminster.A House of Commons spokesperson apologised for the unfortunate demise of Jones’s belongings. “This was a genuine mistake and we are very sorry for the distress and inconvenience caused. Mr Jones will be compensated for the items lost, and we will review our processes to minimise the chance of this happening again.“We recognise that this error will have contributed to what is already a very difficult time.”Asked about the quick turnaround for former MPs to clear their offices and download information, the spokesperson added: “We recognise that losing any job is tough, and as well as being available for those who wanted to come in at the weekend, members who were not re-elected are able to book an appointment with us any time before Friday 20 December.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e14f6f7e50381c867e238da2d4e5bd46a07b70e6/0_0_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c09fcff7a039fa968a549d997075cecc","title":"matt hancock denies u turn over reintroduction of nurse bursary","story":"Annual grants of between £5,000 and £8,000 announced to allay shortage after bursaries cutThe health secretary has denied the government is being forced to clear up its own mistakes by announcing a partial reintroduction of bursary grants for student nurses, which the Conservatives abolished in 2016.In the first major speech by a cabinet minister since last week’s election, Matt Hancock said the annual grants of between £5,000 and £8,000 would play a key part in the government’s promise of having 50,000 extra nurses in place within five years.Repeating Conservative pledges to also to bring in 6,000 more GPs, 50m more GP appointments and 40 new hospitals, Hancock said the government would “deliver on these and each and every commitment in our manifesto”.But answering questions following his speech to a thinktank in Westminster, Hancock declined to say whether there would be any repercussions if these targets were not met, for example ministers resigning, saying only that he was “absolutely committed to delivering” the numbers.The announcement of the nursing student grants, made overnight, follows repeated warnings about drops in the number of would-be nurses since the Conservatives abolished the existing bursary system, also making student nurses pay tuition fees of up to £9,000 a year.But Hancock denied the plan was an admission of error in abolishing the bursaries: “This training grant is different to the offer previously. It is more targeted, and in the last few years, when it hasn’t been in place, we have seen the number of nurses increase by 5,000 in the last year. That is good but 5,000 a year is about half the rate we need to be at to be reaching 50,000.”In his speech, Hancock also promised a major advertising campaign to encourage more people to become student nurses, and to increase the number of places for nursing apprentices, as another route into the profession.He said the announcement of the new grants had been rushed through ahead of the 15 January deadline for university applications, so people could think over Christmas about taking a nursing courses. The money, which begins in September 2020, would also be available for those part-way through courses, he added.Hancock said the planned increase in nursing staff would form part of a wider revamp of the NHS based on better preventative health, and improved working culture, more use of technology and investment in infrastructure.He said: “I am absolutely determined to meet the commitments that we have made, and to make sure that we repay the trust that has been put in us by delivering on the promises that we’ve made and the commitments that we have to this nation’s most-loved institution.”There was, however, no new details on plans to revamp social care. Asked about this, Hancock: “We’ve made very clear on social commitments in our manifesto, and we’ve already been having discussions about starting that work.”Responding to the overnight announcement of the new grants the Royal College of Nursing general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, welcomed it as “a first victory for the campaign that our student nurses are running”.“This announcement will hopefully encourage more people to apply to a nursing degree by the mid-January deadline,” she added. “In the run-up to the budget, we continue to call for our students to not pay tuition fees up front. Any barriers for people wanting to enter nursing must be removed.”Labour’s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “The Conservatives’ policy of forcing would-be nurses to pay tuition fees has demonstrably failed in the last two years.“While it is good to see that they have U-turned on their terrible policy position, nurses have called for additional funding to cover tuition fees too, not just living costs as the Tories promised in their manifesto.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32c42282de58e2344f1ef4299e0c4376aa2af725/0_0_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6cee4feea402d8254bcf390bef9a5f9","title":"tony blair urges labour to ditch jeremy corbyn misguided ideology","story":"Takeover by far left turned party into unelectable ‘glorified protest movement’, says ex-PMTony Blair has called on Labour members to abandon the policies and political leanings of Jeremy Corbyn to ensure the survival of the party. In a provocative intervention, the three-time election-winning former prime minister said that if Corbyn’s wing of the party remains in charge, then Labour will be finished as a political force.Corbyn and his closest allies have called for a period of reflection after Thursday’s general election defeat, Labour’s worst result since 1935. A battle is now under way for control of the party, with Corbyn’s loyalists seemingly determined to retain dominance.“The Labour party, by its self-indulgence – and that’s what it was in the end – was the effective handmaiden of Brexit. It’s not our fault, because the fault is with those who advocated it. But our combination of misguided ideology and utter incompetence allowed it to happen,” the former Labour leader told the BBC’s Newsnight on Wednesday.“The far left that has taken over the Labour party … If they’re in charge of the Labour party going forward, then I think the Labour party is finished.” Although Corbyn’s supporters point out that they managed to attract more than 10m votes, the catastrophic defeat has prompted deep soul-searching in the party.Earlier on Wednesday, Blair delivered a speech in central London in which he described the takeover of Labour by the left as a “glorified protest movement with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government”.He said few would bet against a decade of Conservative rule given the state of Labour, and that unless the party changed course, it faced the threat of never winning power again.“The choice for Labour is to renew itself as the serious, progressive, non-Conservative competitor for power in British politics, or retreat from such an ambition, in which case over time it will be replaced,” Blair said.He criticised Corbyn for leading Labour to defeat with a set of ideas that voters had no interest in. “He personified politically an idea, a brand, of quasi-revolutionary socialism, mixing far-left economic policy with deep hostility to western foreign policy,” he said.Blair continued: “It’s essentially a cry of rage against the system. It’s not a programme for government. To win power we need self-discipline, not self-indulgence.”Corbyn, besides a promise of another EU referendum in which he said he would be neutral, offered voters a radical socialist agenda with higher public spending, sweeping nationalisation and taxes on the wealthy.His supporters have maintained that Blair betrayed the working classes by shifting the party to the right and undermined faith in politicians by supporting the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.Blair said Corbyn’s complicated and equivocal stance on Brexit had displeased both opponents and advocates of the UK’s departure from the EU. “We pursued a path of almost comic indecision, alienated both sides of the debate, leaving our voters without guidance or leadership,” he said. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has also made a public plea for the party to pick a leader from the “mainstream tradition” because it had become a London-centric “liberal left echo chamber”.“What I mean by that is a leader in the mould of John Smith, Clement Attlee – people who understood that Labour had to both. Yes, be radical in the change we want to make, but also have a plan that can be acceptable to the majority of British people, and we seem to have forgotten that,” he said.Referring to the party’s rejection of the radical politics of Michael Foot in the 80s, he said: “We had to learn that lesson in 1983 and I think we are going to learn it all over again in 2019.”Corbyn’s office declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19c5ca005d1d5063813a6e0f78a6d9fb163e74f/0_249_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1d66123b3b50201ff1f8e8c48d37b24","title":"labour leadership election tony blair starmer urges labour to ditch not just corbyn by corbynism in speech on partys defeat live news","story":"The day’s political developments as they happened, including Tony Blair’s speech on the lessons from Labour’s defeatThat’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Here is Richard Burgon explaining why he is considering standing for the deputy leadership of the Labour party.Burgon is stressing the fact that he nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 because this differentiates him from Angela Rayner, who is currently the favourite amongst those likely to run for the deputy leadership.

At a private meeting on Tuesday, diplomats from the 27 member states were told by senior EU lawyers that 1 July 2020 was a hard deadline that could not be changed, if no extension was agreed in the first half of the year.The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January and then falls into an 11-month transition period, where it will remain in the EU single market and customs union without voting rights.Under the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May, the British government has the option to request a one-off extension of the transition of one or two years, before 1 July 2020.The prime minister has promised to legislate against any extension to the transition, but that has not killed speculation that the UK may seek a last-minute delay in late 2020 if a no-deal exit is looming.Lawyers at the EU council’s legal service moved to quash that option on Tuesday, by delivering an uncompromising message that the transition would cease to exist after 1 July 2020, because the withdrawal agreement leaves no provision for later agreement.The message was conveyed in stark terms by EU lawyers, who want this point transmitted to all EU27 national capitals.However, the EU has a track record in declaring immovable deadlines, only to find a workaround when a no-deal deadline loomed. Some EU officials had previously insisted the UK would have to leave the EU before European parliamentary elections in May 2019, only for the UK to secure a delay and elect British MEPs.EU diplomats believe Boris Johnson when he says he doesn’t want to extend the transition period. “It is probably one of the areas where Johnson isn’t lying,” quipped one person in Tuesday’s meeting, a joke appreciated by others.The European commission, which will handle day-to-day negotiations with the UK, has promised to draft a comprehensive mandate for the talks in early February, soon after the UK leaves.That will be a document setting out the EU red lines on the future relationship covering trade, security, foreign policy, education and research and other areas.“We will organise these negotiations to make the most out of the short period. On 1 February we will be ready to propose a mandate for the negotiations,” the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told MEPs this morning.But the commission is already warning member states not everything can be done in 11 months. Von der Leyen has said the commission will have to prioritise key topics, expected to be free trade in goods in exchange for British guarantees of fair competition, as well as fisheries.EU officials continue to stress the UK parliament must ratify the withdrawal agreement.  understands that the European parliament has pencilled in 29 January for ratification of the Brexit deal, assuming the process goes smoothly at Westminster.In her  article Emily Thornberry confirms that she will be a candidate in the Labour leadership contest. (Or at least that she wants to be a candidate she will need to get enough nominations, but this is unlikely to be a problem.) She is the first person to announce her candidature, but within the last 24 hours at least three other possible candidates have given interviews, and Tony Blair – the last person to do the job and actually win an election – has given a detailed speech on what the party needs to do next. Here is a summary of the latest developments.I will say this. This is a fundamental moment in the history of the Labour party and the public is going to judge whoever steps forward for leadership. The public will switch on and look at what these people are saying. And if there’s any sense that they don’t get that a whole ideology, not just an inidual, was rejected, if there is any sense that people say, ‘The policies were all great, we did the right things, it’s just that for some reason it didn’t quite work,’ if there is any sense that we are ignoring the message they have given us, it doesn’t matter who leads the Labour party. We just won’t win again ...The minimum threshold of credibility for any person who wants to lead and win is an acknowledgement that we have been in the wrong political place and we let the country down. If you are not prepared to go that far, even if you win the leadership, you are not going to win an election.Blair also said he did not accept arguments that the next leader had to be a woman, or someone from outside London. It had to be the best person for the job, he said. (See 9.36am.)The takeover of the Labour party by the far left turned it into a glorified protest movement, with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government.The result has brought shame on us. We let our country down. To go into an election at any time with such a ergence between people and party is unacceptable. To do it at a time of national crisis when a credible opposition was so essential to our national interest, is unforgivable.In a later interview, Blair said Labour would be “finished” if the far left stayed in charge. (See 1.49am.)No leadership candidate has come anywhere close to criticising Corbyn and his leadership in these terms. But ...When I faced Johnson for the entire two years he was foreign secretary, the only ministerial job he previously held, my strategy was to focus relentlessly on five key issues where there were huge differences between Labour’s policy and his, and where his position was indefensible: the Northern Ireland border the war in Yemen Donald Trump human rights and climate change.I took the fight to him every day, and pummelled him every week. Each time, the mask slipped, and we saw the real man – a mendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on. He hated it, especially coming from a woman.Thornberry is entitled to say she was effective when it came to challenging Johnson when he was foreign secretary, at least in the Commons. What is also clever about this is that it incorporates an argument for Labour having a woman as leader (which obviously benefits Thornberry) based on the idea that Johnson reacts badly to being challenged by women (which is true), and not just based on pro-ersity sentiment.I don’t need somebody else’s name tattooed to my head, some past leader, in order to identify and make decisions.And Cooper told the same programme:Both Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair are seen as internationalist, not patriots, and we should be able to be both patriotic and outward-looking because that’s what we were in 1945.The extraordinary thing is the Labour party’s desire to rewrite its only period of majority government in half a century in negative terms.We did not ‘neglect’ those traditional Labour heartlands in some appeasement of the middle class. We made the largest ever investment in schools and hospitals in those communities redistributed wealth through tax changes and tax credits cut pensioner and child poverty took the homeless of the streets and, through Sure Start, the minimum wage and a host of other programmes, helped those who needed help most.And we kept their support. In 2005, in Sedgefield, my majority was almost 20,000. In Bolsover, it was 18,000. In Scotland we had 41 of the 56 seats, including two with increased majorities over 2001. The support we lost was mainly amongst the middle class, especially over tuition fees and Iraq. What we should have done, following June 2016, is accepted the result, said it was for the government to negotiate an agreement but reserved our right to critique that agreement and should it fail to be a good deal for the country, advocate the final decision should rest with the people. Ultimately, we might have lost the most ardent Brexit support, but I believe, with different leadership, we would have kept much of our vote in traditional Labour areas, whilst benefiting from the fact that even in those areas, the majority of those voting Labour, were remain.Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, has now given an interview to Newsnight reinforcing the argument he made in his speech this morning - that Labour needs to ditch Corbynism if it wants to survive. (See 9.05am.) In an interview with Kirsty Wark he said:I’ve come to the conclusion in politics, that anger is a redundant emotion. I’m more motivated than I’ve ever been since leaving power, because I really do believe that we’ve just made a disastrous mistake for the country about its future, which is Brexit – and believe me, it will be seen to be a terrible mistake. We are going to have to make it work now, but it’s a terrible mistake. And the Labour party, by its self-indulgence – and that’s what it was in the end – was the effective handmaiden of Brexit. It’s not our fault, because the fault is with those who advocated it. But our combination of misguided ideology and utter incompetence allowed it to happen ...The far left that has taken over the Labour party, if they remain in a position of authority – if they’re in charge of the Labour party going forward then I think the Labour party is finished.From the Financial Times’ Jim PickardSince I have been focusing mostly on the Labour leadership today, here are three clips from Lisa Nandy on Newsnight last night.In the first one she says that, although she wants time to reflect on the general election result first, if she concludes that she can find a root to regaining the trust of lifelong Labour voters, she will stand as a candidate for the leadership.In the second one she says Labour needs to come up with policies to address the needs of towns that have never recovered from the loss of heavy industry. She says in these places young people have to leave to find good jobs, leaving the towns full of people growing old without their children or grandchildren living nearby. Investing in cities and hoping that the wealth will trickle down to these towns has failed, she says.And in this clip she says she thinks there is an opportunity for Labour because Boris Johnson is learning the wrong lessons from his election victory in northern seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b291f00c95e7b12710099ae612c1a4f52481b0/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30bd1d76d3b42269c79b22ae44e2138b","title":"why is matt hancock bringing bursaries back for student nurses","story":"The Conservatives abolished nursing grants in 2015 – so is this a U-turn? Until 2016-17 students doing a first degree in nursing received a bursary from the government worth up to £16,454 a year to help boost the NHS’s supply of “homegrown” nurses.That included payment of a student’s tuition fees of up to £9,000 and a maintenance grant of £1,000, neither of which were means-tested. It also included two other forms of support that did depend on the student’s financial circumstances: a maintenance grant of between £2,207, for those living at home, and £3,191, for students living away from home in London.However, in what critics warned was a misguided and reckless move, the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced in the 2015 comprehensive spending review that bursaries for future nurses were being scrapped in favour of loans. Doing so would increase the number of people training to be a nurse, he insisted.Bursaries were removed in England in 2016, although the other UK nations continued to fund them.The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) says the policy has been very damaging and is a key reason why the number of unfilled vacancies in nursing in the NHS in England has risen and now stands at over 43,000.Since then, the number of applications for nursing courses has fallen, which threatens to exacerbate the NHS’s already serious shortage.In May, health experts drawing up the NHS’s forthcoming strategy to tackle understaffing, the People Plan, warned in a leaked early draft of the document that the service’s shortage of nurses could hit almost 70,000 by 2023-24.Applications from first-time students for nursing degrees have dropped from 52,740 in 2016 to 39,665 this year, a fall of 13,075.The number of students starting a nursing course fell from 22,630 in 2016 to 22,045 in 2017 and 21,745 in 2018 but rose again to 23,060 this year.From the next academic year, starting in September 2020, all nursing students in England will get a £5,000-a-year maintenance grant. In addition, those who plan to work in areas with severe shortages of nurses, or in one of the areas of care where the lack of nurses is acute – such as mental health or learning disability care – will receive another £3,000.Johnson is making good on a key pledge he made during the recent general election campaign. He hopes the grants will encourage more people to choose nursing as a career.Matt Hancock, the health secretary – who was an adviser to Osborne in 2015 – denies that.The RCN has welcomed the grants. But it says that that is only “a first victory” in its campaign for the return of full packages of financial support for would-be nurses. It wants the government to also resume paying tuition fees for student nurses. “Any barriers for people wanting to enter nursing must be removed,” said Dame Donna Kinnair, the union’s general secretary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41f608b424d42969d5f0e7ed13b35c658123047/0_0_2441_1008/master/2441.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b939443aa02308e7d93fc577d5ad26ee 940w","title":"food culture tour bethlehem palestine east jerusalem photo essay","story":"Palestinians increasingly see tourism as a way to tell their story, and a trip to Bethlehem and East Jerusalem offers an evocative insight into the hopes and fears of the West Bank communityby  Rebecca Ratcliffe All photographs by Issy CrokerSmells of spices and coffee waft from shop doorways in Bethlehem’s market. Outside limestone buildings, sellers perch under parasols with stacks of sweet ma’moul biscuits and buckets of bright-pink pickled cauliflower, orange loquat fruits and green sour cherries.I’m being shown around by Fadi Kattan, a French Palestinian chef and hotel owner, and Nadine Baboun, co-founder of Farayek, which runs food tours of Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. Kattan tells me that the market, inaugurated in 1929, is a showcase of the best Palestinian food produce.Much of the produce is brought from nearby villages by sellers such as Um Nabil, who has worked in the market for almost four decades. She used to sell dairy products but today she brings vegetables, including boxes of fresh green chickpeas, beans and sacks of herbs. There is the chance to taste almost anything – from Um Nabil’s chunky raw garlic to makdous (tangy aubergine in olive oil with walnuts and carrots) sold at Samer Daoudi’s pickle and dairy shop, which was recently visited by Jamie Oliver.At midday, we sit down at our final stop: Afteem. The restaurant, off Manger Square, is run by a family who fled Jaffa during the period Palestinians mark as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, when the state of Israel was created and when 700,000 Palestinians were displaced. On the wall hangs a picture of Saliba Salameh, the man who established Afteem in 1948. The restaurant has since become a local institution, and alongside Salameh’s picture are photographs of dignitaries who have since visited to taste its famously light and crispy falafel. There used to be a picture of Tony Blair, says Alaa Salameh, the third generation to run the family restaurant. It had to be taken down because some British guests kept placing napkins over Blair’s head.In Manger Square, tourists are waiting to take tours of the nativity church. Most come on a coach and leave after only a few hours, says Kattan. “They may have a cheap, quick meal. Or they’re taken to a shop that is a Disneyland of everything that has a relation to God,” he adds, referring to the religious souvenir shops. They miss out on much of the town – its market, museums and many restaurants – and rarely go anywhere else in Palestine.“If those people walk around the town and see how we live, it’s a fantastic way to get our real story out,” he says. “Our story to me is anything beyond the perceptions there have been about Palestinians, whether they are the misery side, ‘Oh, the poor Palestinians’, or the fantasy of ‘Oh, Palestine is dangerous’,” says Kattan.Palestinians are especially hospitable because they want outsiders to see their country, he says: “We have a beautiful country and people don’t realise it.” Kattan, who opened a hotel in the town four years ago, is on a mission to change this. Over the next four days he recommends a tour of Palestine’s cultural sites, markets and erse landscape.I’m staying at his hotel, Hosh Al-Syrian (doubles from £63 B\u0026ampB), in a renovated building in the old city, which dates back 1,000 years. Its 12 rooms have arched walls and deep-red carpets. Its adjoining restaurant, Fawda, sources all ingredients from local producers and offers a fusion of French and Palestinian cuisine. It is not designed for pilgrims looking for a bargain room but for people with an interest in Palestinian food, geopolitics and culture.Hosh Al-Syrian is a contrast to Banksy’s much-publicised Walled Off hotel, which opened nearby in 2017. On my first afternoon in Palestine, I visit its museum. Interiors are an uncomfortable mix of lavish British colonial decor and reminders of the occupation. Afternoon tea is served on the patio, in a gilded china teapot, while the grey concrete wall that ides Israel from the Palestinian territories looms opposite. It’s a jarring experience.Some argue that aspects of the hotel trivialise the occupation. There are, says Kattan, plenty of hotels and restaurants that offer a more authentic experience. Local businesses – which have far less financial clout – face the greatest challenges when operating in a volatile political context. Another day, we eat at Abu Eli’s restaurant,  where I’m told the family’s kebabs are so good that his father was once escorted by security to cook for Yasser Arafat (I’m vegetarian, but enjoy a delicious range of salads). Kattan also recommends having a drink in the Rewined bar, but unfortunately, it’s closed when I’m in town.I visit the Bethlehem Historical Museum, established by the town’s Arab Women’s Union, which Kattan’s late grandmother, Julia, helped to found. The association, created in 1947 (during the Arab-Israeli war to provide employment for women and deliver aid to refugees) became a cultural beacon in the city, Kattan tells me. “They opened the first mixed-sex pool in Palestine, the first public library in Palestine,” he says. Many of its projects closed but the museum and food production projects survived. Lots of its exhibits have been donated by local families and show how life in the town has changed: from the designs of homes to traditional clothing.To get from Bethlehem to Jerusalem, tourists must show a passport and visa at a checkpoint, but they don’t face the same travel restrictions as Palestinians living in the West Bank. They have to apply for a permit to enter Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.Heading for Jerusalem, I walk through checkpoint 300 before taking a taxi. In the late morning, there’s only a short queue of families waiting to get through the turnstiles. In the early hours it’s a different story: thousands of Palestinians start queuing as early as 3am to get through in time to start their jobs in Jerusalem.Back in the West Bank, we travel to Sebastia in the north of the territory to view the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. It is believed that the remains of John the Baptist (except for his head, which was apparently taken to Damascus) are buried here in a tomb in the cental courtyard of a mosque whose outside used to be a Crusader church. The site shows the layering of history that has shaped Palestine, says Kattan.From the rooftop of Hosh Al-Syrian there’s a view across all Bethlehem’s churches and mosques. In the early morning, the sound of church bells mingles with the call to prayer. There are several myths about the territory, Kattan adds, including the belief that it is home to just one religion. “It’s varied. Even within each of the inidual religions you have so many small communities where the traditions are different,” he says. “It’s one of the places where you learn more about brotherhood between religions … historically all faiths have lived together here.”On the walls of the dining area hang colourful patterned plates made by the famous Jerusalem Pottery, a business run by an Armenian family, part of the erse range of communities in East Jerusalem.• The trip was provided by Hosh Al-Syrian, Amos Trust (a small, creative human rights organisation) and Zaytoun, a social enterprise and community interest companyLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Quite a lot, actually, when it is the Starbucks cup that made the most high-profile cameo in Game of Thrones since Ed Sheeran appeared as a Lannister soldier. No cultural artefact assumed a greater significance in 2019 than the Starbucks cup. An HBO staffer came, they frapped, then all hell broke loose. Will we ever solve 2019’s most enduring mystery?First: a recap. Before the Starbucks cup became the cup, it was just a cup, left by a cast or crew member during a break in filming. It was the US YouTuber Zane Hijazi who spotted the error during the premiere of season eight’s fourth episode, The Battle of the Starks. Pandemonium ensued. In the scene, the Stark and Targaryen forces are carousing after winning the Battle of Winterfell. Enter stage left: the cup. “My favourite show in the entire world forgot a STARBUCKS COFFEE CUP ON THE TABLE WHILE FILMING,” Hijazi tweeted. The clip has been retweeted 146,000 times, and had more than half a million likes. Presumably none of those came from the HBO post-production team who failed to spot the offending receptacle and edit it out of the show.At first, Emilia Clarke seemed the most obvious culprit – she was sitting right beside it. But then Clarke went full Littlefinger on Conleth Hill. “We had a party before the Emmys recently,” Clarke said on Jimmy Fallon, “and Conleth, who plays Varys, who’s sitting next to me in that scene, he pulls me aside and he’s like: ‘Emilia, I have got to tell you something, love. The coffee cup was mine.’” Hill issued a robust denial. “I would need to have had Mr Man arms to leave a coffee cup there,” he told Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch. “I took a bullet for Emilia Clarke and she touted on me.” After the initial backstabbings, HBO’s cast and crew closed ranks – their lips are as sealed as Ned Stark’s were on Jon Snow’s true parentage. The mystery lives on.How can we explain our mania for the mistake and the cover-up? First, it has all the elements of a classic whodunnit: intrigue, ignominy and actors in period dress. Second, it is highly shareable – Photoshopped memes of the cup circulated endlessly on social media. And third, it is a bit of jollity amid an otherwise overwhelmingly negative response to the show’s final season, which suffered a drubbing from fans and critics.Personally, I think #cupgate took root because we are pernickety idiots who love to think we would never make a mistake on that scale and actually could do a far better job of things. (See also: the ridiculous petition to remake season eight, set up by an aggrieved fan.) It is also a reminder that even the biggest TV shows get it wrong. To err is human. To leave a Starbucks cup in Westeros, ine.And on the deathless question of whodunnit? I think it was Samwell Tarly, in the library, framing Daenerys after she flame-roasted his dad and brother. Next time – use a reusable mug. Disposable cups are so 2009.The Hot Priest rocked the Catholic church. There was an extreme and troubling tourist boom in Chernobyl.

If approved, it would be allowed to roughly double the amount of toxic emissions in the parish annually.The project is opposed by a group of community activists in the majority African American parish, who argue the emissions would prove an intolerable health risk. The revelations on the site’s historic significance has further angered residents, many of whom trace their ancestry back to enslavement in the region.The discovery of slave burial grounds on industrial land in the heavily polluted region between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, known colloquially as “Cancer Alley”, has happened in the past. But the revelations are likely to intensify the fight in one of the most contentious new developments in the region.Sharon Lavigne, a resident opposed to the development, said the discovery of the cemeteries was “gut-wrenching” and made the proposed site “hallowed ground”.“I have buried so many family members and friends who have died from cancer. Our community cannot handle another chemical plant,” Lavigne said.Formosa is currently navigating the approval process with state authorities and as part of this quietly commissioned archaeological research on the land earmarked for development.Although initial cultural surveys conducted by the company in 2018 had indicated there were not historically significant sites on the land Formosa plans to build on, the company were later alerted to maps from the late 19th century – submitted to the state’s ision of archaeology by an independent researcher – that indicated two cemeteries tied to old plantations on the land.According to hundreds of pages of emails, reports and surveys released under freedom of information laws to lawyers working for community activists and reviewed by the  before publication, Formosa has found one of these sites, the Buena Vista cemetery, is still intact.Any evidence of the other, listed as the Arcadia cemetery, could not be located by excavators working for a contractor, who believe that either any human remains or other physical signs of grave sites have been destroyed by construction carried out by previous land users or that the cemetery may never have existed.It was still unclear how many bodies were held in the graveyard, about an acre in size. Historical records of the lives and deaths of the millions of people enslaved in the United States are scant and often non-existent.The Buena Vista site sits in a so-called project “buffer zone”, meaning no construction is planned there, despite Formosa owning the land.Janile Parks, director of community and government relations for the Formosa project, said the company has now “fenced in the identified area to protect it”. She added that Formosa had “conducted archival research and has not been able to connect the plot to anyone or any particular event”.She said: “As the project progresses, Formosa will follow all applicable state and federal laws in regards to the burial ground and public notification.”Internal emails suggest that the Arcadia site posed more of an issue to the Formosa project as the old maps indicated it sat directly underneath an area proposed for construction.Lawyers working for Formosa acknowledged in August 2018 that if human remains were recovered at this site the company “could choose to protect the area from any further construction disturbance with a fence and plaque” but noted that this “would mean that portions of the planned utilities plant may have to be relocated” a move that would be “a very difficult option”. The emails indicate that Formosa favored removing remains and relocating them to another cemetery. Contractors later recovered no remains from the site.It is expected that Formosa will continue its construction plans with this site, a state official said.Residents in St James expressed frustration that Formosa did not notify community members about the discovery of the sites, particularly before the parish council approved permits in December 2018.Formosa said it had “conducted all field work in coordination with the appropriate agencies” including the State Historic Preservation Office. It described the review as a “lengthy and regulated process”.Lavigne, the founder and president of Rise St James, argued that the cemetery revelations should thwart the Formosa project entirely.“I feel like God is answering my prayers,” said Lavigne. “This will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.”She said the group plans to use the new information on potential slave burial sites to ask the parish council to reconsider permits already approved for the Formosa project.Still, it’s unlikely the grave sites will seriously impact Formosa’s progress, state officials said.Greg Langley, press secretary for the Louisiana department of environmental quality (LDEQ), a state permitting agency, said he couldn’t comment specifically on outstanding permits for Formosa. But he said: “Normally this type of situation would not affect the permits.”Formosa is awaiting a decision from LDEQ on its proposed air permit before it can begin construction.Spees, meanwhile, highlighted the need for a more thorough investigation of historical assets on the land as industrial development continues to grow in Cancer Alley.“They are putting these industries on land where we know there are people buried,” she said. “How many have already been destroyed along this stretch? What do we need to do to really acknowledge and preserve and protect these types of burial sites?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc74f49f62ab104f7b70dfafeb7eddc7df62e33/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c8cebab104b43b2a6be06cc80d4ac6","title":"native american women trafficked searchlight new mexico","story":"Nearly a quarter of New Mexico’s trafficking victims are Native American – and women and girls are the least protected as the state struggles to address the problemEva was found at dusk in late December 2016, standing in an Albuquerque parking lot. The 15-year-old Navajo girl had been missing more than two weeks when her grandmother got a call from the Bernalillo county sheriff’s office – saying her silver Ford truck had been recovered.“I don’t care about the truck, what about my granddaughter?” Heidi demanded.She drove three hours, from her house outside Gallup, and arrived a few minutes after 1am to see Eva emerge from the juvenile holding area, quiet and hunched. Her cheeks and neck looked skeletal. She kept her answers short and rolled her eyes. A familiar pattern was unfolding.Back in the car, Heidi locked the doors. Give me my phone, Eva said.A 16-month investigation by Searchlight New Mexico has found that when it comes to human trafficking, indigenous women and girls are the least recognized and least protected population in a state that struggles to address the problem. An almost total lack of protocols, mandated training and coordination among law enforcement systems and medical institutions has ensnared victims in ongoing cycles of exploitation.That includes Eva, who, by her own recounting as well as notes from medical personnel, caseworkers and therapists, was systematically lured, coerced, threatened and traded for sex for money, drugs and favors over a two-year period. Her name, along with those of her family members, have been changed for reasons of safety and privacy.Eva showed many of the warning signs of someone who has been trafficked. She was anxious, depressed, mute and had little sense of time. She was frequently reported missing, appeared malnourished and occasionally bruised. But despite multiple brushes with law enforcement agencies and healthcare institutions, she was not once questioned or screened for human trafficking.“Nobody saw me,” she says. “Not until the very end.”Growing up on the Zuni and Navajo reservations of western New Mexico, Eva moved continuously between her mother’s home and that of her grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. The only constant in her life was Haley, her sister four and a half years her junior.Eva was the effusive one, admired for her lanky limbs and her gift for sketching. She was the one to initiate games of basketball in the driveway, scolding her cousins when they didn’t pass the ball to Haley.The girls’ mother, Lea, worked multiple jobs as a nurse’s aide, and the family had a comfortable life in an area where the median household income hovers at $27,000 a year. Lea entered the girls in child beauty pageants in the big cities of Gallup, Albuquerque and Las Cruces. She was the kind of mother who on a whim would take them on a road trip to White Sands Monument or the redwood forests of northern California.That all changed the year Eva turned 11. Lea had long struggled with alcoholism, and as the disease worsened she increasingly left her daughters in the care of others or alone at home. When she was too intoxicated to drive, she propped Eva on a pile of blankets to see over the steering wheel of the family’s 1999 Honda Civic. Eva began skipping school, where she got in trouble for smoking. In seventh grade, she was expelled for fighting and never went back.Only later would Eva and Haley confide in their grandmother that their stepfather physically, sexually and emotionally abused them. “Don’t you tell Grandma what happens in this house,” he often said.Heidi said she kept as close a watch as she could, and when she saw them, she would give the girls almost anything they wanted. For Eva’s 12th birthday, her grandmother bought her an iPhone, so Eva could call whenever they were left alone at home.“Buying her that phone was the worst thing I ever did,” Heidi says now.On 8 December 2015, Eva saw a Facebook message from a young man with a thick brow and a round jawline. “I remember you from middle school,” he wrote. Eva, then 13, didn’t recognize him, but she assumed she knew him. “Everyone on the reservation knows everyone,” she says. “Or they pretend they do.”D, as she came to call him, enthused about her large brown eyes, her dimples and the way she wore her hair in French braids. He asked for photos and she sent him intimate selfies, soon followed by more explicit pictures. She eventually drove to his house in her mother’s car – propped up on blankets – and they drank beer and smoked marijuana. D told her he loved her, and Eva felt needed and exultant, unmoored from the problems at home.As the months went by, he took more photos and recorded videos – usually of Eva performing oral sex. His affectionate ways were soon supplanted by forceful sex, violence and threats. He threatened to share his photos and videos on Facebook and hurt her little sister if she were to say anything. He invited other men – he said they were his brother and cousin – to the house, where they also molested and raped Eva. She remembers initially resisting, punching one of them, and hearing the words “Just do it” before a weight fell on her.In the fall of 2016, D redoubled his threats against Eva, promising to harm her grandmother and abduct her sister if she spoke out. If anyone could have helped Eva, it would have been her mother. Lea knew, or at least suspected, what was happening she had seen the nude photos of her daughter and did nothing. Then in November, she died after an incident near Shiprock.For weeks after the funeral Eva lay on the floor of her grandmother’s house, while her phones buzzed with messages. By now, she had four Samsung cellphones, all supplied by D, who texted daily, demanding more photos, threatening violence unless she picked herself off the ground and met him. Which she did, as if pulled by a wire tethered to her feet – driving or being driven to faraway towns and switching between cars with strange men.Sex trafficking is defined as the exploitation of iniduals through threat or use of force, coercion andor fraud to induce a “commercial sex act”. It is a growing crime that’s estimated to generate $99bn a year globally, and in the US, people of color – mostly black and indigenous women – are victimized at the highest rates.But the mainstream definition need to be reshaped when considering the ways indigenous women and girls are victimized, says Maureen Lomahaptewa, a Hopi woman and caseworker at the Life Link, a Santa Fe-based not-for-profit that shelters and serves trafficking victims..This year, the Navajo nation council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty spearheaded an as yet unpublished white paper on trafficking in the Navajo nation. It is intended to serve as a warning to policymakers – though not all tribal leaders regard the issue with the same urgency. The Navajo nation police chief, Philip Francisco, for one, says he does not see sex trafficking as a problem in his jurisdiction. “It’s more of a border issue,” he says.Of course, trafficking and exploitation are hardly a new phenomenon in indigenous communities. For centuries, sexual violence has been a cornerstone of the treatment of Native American populations, integral to colonization and displacement. Sex trafficking of contemporary indigenous women is “almost indistinguishable from the colonial tactics of enslavement, exploitation, exportation and relocation”, writes Sarah Deer, professor of law at Kansas University and author of The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America.Today, high rates of chemical dependency, abuse and involvement in the foster care system exacerbate vulnerability to predators, the vast majority of whom are non-Native. As noted in Crotty’s white paper, female minors, homeless youth and transgender or two-spiritLGBTQ+ people are most vulnerable to trafficking. And, as tribal leaders have found in NDFS cases, family members have been known to exchange younger children for money, drugs or basic needs. “We’ve seen our children trafficked by their own family, and most don’t even know they were trafficked,” says Crotty.After conducting more than 75 interviews and gathering data from 18 agencies, Searchlight shared Eva’s story with nine tribal police officers, four tribal officials and two former clinicians for the Indian Health Service. No one expressed surprise.“Tribal agencies are understaffed, underfunded and undertrained in this type of response,” says Darren Soland, Ramah Navajo police chief. “Once someone who is being victimized goes from tribal to state land or to a municipality and maybe comes back, it’s hard to get the agencies to reach out and communicate with each.”A July 2019 study in the journal Criminology \u0026amp Public Policy explored the reasons why law enforcement officers rarely recognize trafficking victims and found that some say they are unaware that this is a crime over which they have jurisdiction while others don’t believe it is an issue present in their communities. The majority of states, including New Mexico, require no law enforcement training on human trafficking.And while lawmakers have proposed legislation, their efforts have largely stalled. The renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which would better assist indigenous victims and increase cross-agency communication, is stalled in the US. Senate.In a written response to questions, a spokesperson from the FBI’s New Mexico headquarters wrote: “The FBI is committed to fulfilling our mandate to investigate the most serious crimes in Indian Country … The FBI aggressively investigates any reports of human trafficking, using force-multiplying Human Trafficking Task Forces.”“We’re letting the FBI off the hook way too easily,” said Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee Nation lawyer and counsel to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center. “And I wish more senators would call them to account for how few investigations go anywhere. They need to have an oversight hearing on why the FBI is abdicating its duties.”In December 2016, Eva was handcuffed outside a Dollar Store in north-east Albuquerque for stealing her grandmother’s truck, and placed in a 90-day program at Butterfly Healing Center, a co-ed treatment center for Native American teens in Taos. That’s where, at last, she began to talk.Her disclosure set in motion a string of reports that reverberated across agencies and culminated in a three-hour interview with the FBI. To date, no charges have been filed.In the last 14 months since departing a safe house, Eva, now 18, and Haley, 13, have each enrolled in two new schools and changed apartments three times. Eva has gone missing once. She has also been arrested once.Many nights, she resists sleep. Nightmares ensue, and the sensation of near-sleep reminds her of the feeling she experienced when she was being trafficked – weightless and contorted underwater.“I want to make it not real. But I was living there. And sometimes, I’m still living there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac7afb05e3454fa3f0bda6473e93f538bb030497/512_44_4370_2621/master/4370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4607b669eeae0106bda544318b5ed041","title":"eu parliament calls on malta pm joseph muscat to resign over daphne caruana galizias case","story":"Resolution questions ‘integrity and credibility’ of murder investigationThe European parliament has called on Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, to quit immediately over his handling of the investigation into the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, as it declared there were “serious and persistent threats” to democracy and the rule of law on the island nation.In a resolution approved by a large majority, the European parliament said it was deeply concerned about “the integrity and credibility” of the investigation into the death of Caruana Galizia, who exposed the shady financial dealings of Maltese elite and was murdered in a car bombing in October 2017.The journalist’s assassination has turned the spotlight on Malta’s governing class, raising questions about its record in tackling corruption and money laundering, as well as the sale of “golden” passports that allowed wealthy people to live anywhere in the EU.While the resolution cannot compel the Maltese government to act, it heaps pressure on the embattled prime minister, who has promised to stand down on 12 January. Two-time election winner Joseph Muscat announced his resignation earlier this month, after it emerged his chief of staff was about to be questioned by police in connection with the case.A European parliament press statement to accompany the resolution was more direct: “Maltese prime minister should resign now.” But the parliament retracted that statement a few hours later, returning to the more cautious wording of the resolution described by one source as “a very roundabout way of saying he should resign now”.The resolution was approved by 581 of the 690 MEPs who voted in Strasbourg, with 83 voting against and 26 abstaining.MEPs also raised concerns about corruption and money-laundering on the island, while lamenting that a makeshift memorial to Caruana Galizia in the Maltese capital was cleared away every day. It called on Muscat to put an “an immediate stop to the near-daily destruction of the makeshift memorial in Valletta”.The wide-ranging resolution was co-drafted by a cross-party trio of MEPs, who took part in an emergency mission to Malta early this month, after progress into the police investigation prompted the resignation of Muscat’s chief of staff, Keith Schembri.Schembri, who masterminded two election victories for Muscat, has been arrested and released without charge twice in connection with the case. The prime suspect in the murder, the Maltese tycoon Yorgen Fenech, told a court Schembri gave him updates about the police investigation. Fenech has pleaded not guilty to complicity in the murder and all other charges linked to the case. Schembri has denied all wrongdoing.The resolution, supported across the political spectrum, states that the parliament “deeply regrets that developments in Malta in recent years have led to serious and persistent threats to the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media, the independence of the police and judiciary and the freedom of peaceful assembly”.The language deliberately echoes that of the EU treaty’s article 7 on the rule of law, which could lead to a member state being stripped of voting rights if a “serious and persistent” breach of democratic values is found.But the parliament stopped short of triggering the EU sanctions procedure. This procedure, currently being used against Poland and Hungary, is increasingly seen as ineffective, because it relies on EU member states acting against one of their own.Article 7 “is a cannon without gunpowder”, the German Green MEP Sven Giegold, who co-drafted the resolution, said. “It is wiser to have several shots open rather than start with the loudest weapon and waste it.”In a statement following the vote, Giegold said: “The European commission can no longer turn a blind eye to the culture of impunity when it comes to money laundering and corruption in Malta. The newly elected commission must begin dialogue with the Maltese government on the rule of law with a view to commencing article 7 proceedings, if no immediate progress is made from the Maltese side.”Earlier this week, the EU commissioner for justice, Didier Reynders, urged the Maltese government to speed up work to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, tackle corruption and set up a prosecution service free from any control by the prime minister. These were all identified as problems by experts at the Council of Europe, a separate body to the EU. “Recent controversies have underlined that progress should accelerate,” Reynders wrote to the Maltese justice minister, Owen Bonnici. “Clarity about the steps and timetable ahead would be the best way to make clear that the commitments of the Maltese government to progress will be taken forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d41c804500b07312d5dd3d80c153738bc0dbd7/0_341_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8e4532ef151bf66e76c5efe5130a378","title":"its a little worn paris champs elysees in line for 250m make over","story":"Avenue in French capital, often called the world’s most beautiful, has seen better daysThe Champs-Élysées, often called the “most beautiful avenue in the world”, is not what it was. The pavements are cracked, the trees that line the cobbled, traffic-clogged road struggle to survive in one of Paris’s most polluted areas, and Parisians stay away.Now local community leaders have unveiled an ambitious €250m (£212m) project to restore the celebrated 1.2 mile (1.9km) long avenue to at least some of its former glory.“It’s often called the world’s most beautiful avenue, but those of us who work here every day are not at all sure about that. The Champs-Élysées has more and more visitors and big name businesses battle to be on it, but to French people it’s looking worn out,” Jean-Noël Reinhardt, president of the Champs-Élysées committee said.Reinhardt says his association, which represents those who live, work and trade on the avenue running from the Arc de Triomphe on Place Charles de Gaulle to Place de la Concorde, will present their plans to the candidates standing in next year’s municipal elections in January.The Champs-Élysées makeover would need public and private investment, he told journalists.The Champs-Élysées was originally a mixture of swamp and kitchen gardens when André Le Nôtre, gardener to Louis XIV the Sun King, first laid out the wide promenade lined with a double row of elm trees on each side, called the Grand Cours. In 1709, it was renamed the Champs-Élysées and extended, and by the end of the century had become a popular place to walk and picnic.The city celebrated its liberation from the Nazis in 1944 on the Champs-Élysées and World Cup victories still bring out the crowds, but its famous charm has faded. Today it is known for its expensive cafes, luxury shops, high-end car salesrooms and commercial rents that are among the highest in the world, as well as the annual Bastille Day military parade. More recently it was the scene of some of the most violent clashes between gilets jaunes and riot police.Its name is French for the mythical Greek paradise, the Elysian Fields but Parisians largely shun it.Chiambaretta said it needed to be developed to be “ecological, desirable and inclusive”.“It was always designed for the people and shouldn’t just be a luxury avenue,” Chiambaretta said.He admitted the Champs-Élysées had become a place that summed up the problems faced by cities around the world: “Pollution, the place of the car, tourism and consumerism.”The ambitious plans include reducing the space for vehicles by half, creating tunnels of trees and encouraging more aesthetic use of commercial spaces such as terraces. The committee also wants a major rethink of the area all around the Champs-Élysées to make it more pedestrian friendly up to and including the nearby River Seine, with traffic erted into a tunnel.“We work here every day so we know we have to profoundly change things. We can’t just say it’s the responsibility of the public authorities. We want the Champs-Élysées to remain a centre of attraction in the world, we want tourists to keep coming but we want the Parisians who used to come here 100 years ago to come back,” Reinhardt said.Plans to improve the Champs-Élysées are not new, but as Paris prepares to host the 2024 Olympics, there is an impetus to spruce up the city’s most celebrated street before the world descends.A Paris city hall spokeswoman said the Champs-Élysées is already closed to traffic one Sunday every month and the city authorities had already carried out work including a cycle lane on the avenue.Chiambaretta says some of the work could begin after next year’s elections, but the wider project would have to wait until after the games.Futuristic sketches showing the Arc de Triomphe surrounded by sand and water or transformed into an ice rink are, Chiambaretta admits, probably a pipe dream.Giving the Champs Élysées and its surroundings a makeover is not, he says. “We have to think big and not just about the Champs-Élysées, but all around it,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05cb2800ea48850f58b53c12fa2be251ff447a55/0_0_3479_2088/master/3479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4e8adfaf63bc02f6017ac849bc382f","title":"members of angela merkels party found to have far right links","story":"CDU criticised for allegedly failing to guard against neo-Nazis and ‘prepper’ infiltrationPressure is mounting on the leadership of Angela Merkel’s conservative party to fortify its “firewall against the far right”, as more members of the Christian Democratic Union were revealed to be members of a shadowy military network with links to “prepper” or survivalist circles.Last week a member of the CDU’s executive committee in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Robert Möritz, confirmed that he was a member of Uniter, a private support network for active and former soldiers and security personnel.In the wake of the assassination of the pro-refugee politician Walter Lübcke and a white supremacist’s planned terror attack on a synagogue in Halle, security circles have raised alarm about rightwing extremist attempts to infiltrate the military and police.While Uniter remains a legally registered association and is currently not on any of the intelligence agencies’ official watchlists, its founder André Schmitt is on trial for offences against Germany’s weapons and explosives act.Uniter’s founder also set up and administered a complex command chain of Telegram chat networks, in whose subgroups so-called preppers discussed plans to build up parallel infrastructures in preparation for the anticipated collapse of the prevailing social order.Some of the chats, which were ided into regional districts, covered the threat of Islamist terrorist attacks and how to respond to them by hoarding weapons, munitions and food supplies. Other prepper groups have been accused of compiling “death lists” of leftwing and pro-refugee targets, as well as ordering body bags and quicklime to dispose of their victims after a “Day X” doomsday scenario.So far the CDU’s branch in Saxony-Anhalt has declined to expel the ex-Uniter member Möritz, in spite of him admitting to taking part in a neo-Nazi rally in 2011 and carrying a “black sun” tattoo on his right arm, a symbol which has been adopted by neo-Nazis and occultists. The CDU’s district leader in Anhalt-Bitterfeld insisted the 29-year-old had “credibly” distanced himself from his rightwing extremist past.Uniter’s enmeshment with the eastern offices of Germany’s dominant political party of the postwar era is more intricate than previously known, however. Kai Mehliss, a member of the CDU’s hardline “conservative circle” who also sits on the district branch in Anhalt-Bitterfeld, is listed on Uniter’s website as a member and organised a roundtable event for the network as recently as last week. Like Möritz, he has since cancelled his membership.Another CDU member, a town councillor in the municipality of Sandersdorf-Brehna, was a founding member of Uniter in its original incarnation in 2012, before the association was founded anew in Stuttgart.The local politician said on Wednesday that he co-founded Uniter to help elite German soldiers find employment after they had been deployed abroad, and claimed not to know the other two Uniter members in his party personally. Since Saturday, his profile appears to have been removed from the CDU’s website.The revelations came on the eve of what is likely to be Angela Merkel’s last full year as German chancellor, and as the country nervously eyes her party’s political direction in the post-Merkel era.While Merkel’s successor at the head of the CDU, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is a politician in the chancellor’s liberal mould, conservative politicians in the eastern states have agitated for the party to drop its cordon sanitaire against coalitions with the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland.The general secretary of Merkel’s junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party, on Wednesday accused Kramp-Karrenbauer of failing to crack down on far-right tendencies in her party.“What we are seeing in the CDU’s Saxony-Anhalt branch is a bursting of the dam against the far right,” Lars Klingbeil told Tagesspiegel newspaper. Social Democrat politician Ralf Stegner, meanwhile, said events in Saxony-Anhalt showed “the firewall against the far right is crumbling”.The veteran conservative and former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said that “democratic parties, and especially the party of which I am a member, must not have anything to do with neo-Nazis”. But many senior figures in the party have stopped short of explicitly calling for the expulsion of members with a neo-Nazi past.The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, at the start of this week announced 600 new intelligence positions for weeding out potentially violent rightwing extremists and their networks. But opposition politicians say the search will have to start at the door of Seehofer’s own agencies.One founding member of Uniter in its 2016 incarnation, Ringo M, used to work for the domestic intelligence agency in Baden-Württemberg, while one of Uniter’s four district leaders has been training police at a police academy in Brandenburg.Armin Schuster, a CDU chairman of the Bundestag’s committee on internal affairs, rejected claims that German security had a “large-scale problem” with the far right, but conceded some of the recent revelations had been troubling. “What we are seeing is a number of isolated suspicious cases, and every single one of them is one too many for me,” Schuster told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b725340b76d702c9a5be3ab32bba53151febec02/159_94_794_476/master/794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed56777666147ce813c0e62a1568bce9","title":"tell us what you want to do in your last year as an eu citizen","story":"British citizens will cease to be EU citizens from December 2020.

Photograph: OireachtasPA WireThe authors of an independent review of tests made under the CervicalCheck screening programme have defended their work following criticism from patient advocates.The review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists earlier this month found an opportunity to identify 159 women’s cervical cancers had been missed by CervicalCheck out of 1,038 women whose slides were checked. However, it concluded that the Irish cervical cancer screening programme was “performing effectively”.Vicky Phelan and Lorraine Walsh, two of the best-known women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy, have said they have no confidence in the review after discovering errors were made in labelling their own slides.Prof Henry Kitchener, the college’s lead assessor, said the mislabelling of the two women’s smear test slides appeared to be a “remarkable coincidence” that took place following the completion of the review. ‘No implications’He told the Oireachtas health committee that the mislabelling issue had no implications for the safe conduct of the review. Supplementary letters have been issued to three of the women in the review, Prof Kitchener confirmed, and in two of these cases the original conclusion was altered. He expressed regret for “these isolated incidents” and that the college was confident every woman had received an accurate disclosure of her review results.The review has also been criticised after it emerged that some women were given a “concordant” result even though some of their slides were missing.Prof Kitchener said the fact that some slides were not available would not have altered the conclusions reached in the review. “I’m certain those missing slides would not have altered our conclusions,” he said. He added that the number of patients involved represented less than 2 per cent of the overall cohort, and the women who received a “partial report” were not a homogenous group.Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer at the Department of Health, admitted it was “surprising” that two of the women affected by the mislabelling were Ms Phelan and Ms Walsh, but he pointed out that the college would not have known the identities of the women whose slides were being reviewed.Criticism from TDsDr Holohan apologised for not providing his statement to the committee in advance, following criticism from TDs.Asked about the comments of Ms Walsh at Tuesday’s sitting of the committee, at which she claimed she had been “dismissed, ignored, bullied and threatened” by the Department, Dr Holohan said he was aware of the remarks.He said he was also aware that some patient advocates had not been in a position to express confidence in the college’s report. If he had been involved in a review and two separate errors had been made, he would find it difficult to express confidence in it, he said. But this was a “very different thing” from concluding that you could not have confidence in the rest of the report.Dr Holohan said the Department regarded the input of patient representatives as very important and it was at an advanced stage in drawing up proposals to recognise the time these representatives put in."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Government to appoint 1,000 additional medical specialists over next 10 yearsPublic support healthcare workers by sounding car horns and offering hot drinks and foodResumption of some \u0026lsquolow level\u0026rsquo activity in the Cavan-Fermanagh Border area reportedSale would have caused \u0026lsquogreat pain\u0026rsquo if home of late Garech Browne had gone into wrong handsContinuing mood of optimism that deal can be found to restore StormontVaradkar says cancellation rate in Ireland around 2 per cent or 3 per centHowlin asks if Varadkar will discuss election dates with other parties as well as Fianna F\u0026aacuteilLocal TD says he cannot imagine the horror family are going through after young woman\u0026rsquos deathLiquidation of football body being examined but Minister wants to \u0026lsquoavoid that at all costs\u0026rsquoAnnemarie Hooper (33) was fatally injured when car driven by Dean Coleman left roadRecently widowed woman sues HSE over samples tested at University College Hospital, GalwayRosemarie Gallagher (61) crashed into Benjamin Renard (24) on Adelaide Road in DublinRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists defends its review of CervicalCheckIrish Water pleaded guilty to offences under the Waste Water Discharge last yearSeasonal song shows people with Down syndrome can have strong loving relationshipsFormer minister says he will be appealing to voters across the political spectrumDoctor was jailed for four years this year for indecently assaulting seven boys in his care"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4119024.1576659880!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"border residents feel overwhelming uncertainty due to brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA lorry passes an anti-Brexit billboard seen on the Dublin-Newry road last October. Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesMany people living along the Border have an “overwhelming feeling of uncertainty” as a result of Brexit, according to a new report by researchers at Queen’s University, Belfast (QUB) and the Irish Central Border Area Network (ICBAN). Those surveyed also described how Brexit had already had an economic and social impact on their lives and future plans, and had put off making financial or business decisions, or had experienced major changes such as the loss of a job or problems in labour recruitment because of Brexit. Many felt a “related sense of insecurity” which was “exacerbated by ongoing speculation about what the future for the Border might be.” The Border Into Brexit: Perspectives from Local Communities in the Central Border Region of IrelandNorthern Ireland is the third in a series of reports by QUB, in association with ICBAN, which study the views of Border residents on Brexit. More than 500 people from Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo in the Republic of Ireland, as well as those in the council areas of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Fermanagh and Omagh and Mid Ulster in Northern Ireland, contributed to the research. The report also described a “feeling of lack of political representation and voicelessness which exacerbates the sense of anxiety.” “I feel very angry that there is no one to represent my voice in the UK Parliament - and also in our local Assembly,” said one respondent. “This is the area and the people that are likely to be most affected and where are the leaders representing us?” The first phase of the research was carried out before the Brexit deadline on October 31st, when the risk of a no deal Brexit appeared highest, while the second phase was conducted after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, had concluded his revised Withdrawal Agreement with the EU and Britain’s withdrawal deadline had been extended until the end of January. In this context, more than four out of five of those surveyed felt the likelihood of a hard Border had increased since 2018. “The overwhelming reason given for this view is political leadership in Westminster, specifically the stance of PM Boris Johnson and the rhetoric of the British government on No Deal. Another reason given is the lack of political leadership from Stormont. “Regardless of views of its likelihood, a harder border is unanimously seen as a retrograde step” and was “associated with conflict in the minds of people of all generations.” For this reason, the report found, the prospect “fear and anxiety for many.” One of the report’s authors, Dr Katy Hayward, said that the “Withdrawal Agreement - objected to by all 18 newly-elected MPs from Northern Ireland - looks set to be ratified, and so Brexit appears likely to see change, to some degree, to borders all around Northern Ireland, as the new UK-EU relationship takes effect.”“In light of this,” she said, “trust-building and cooperation, north-south and British-Irish, will be more important than ever. “The models and examples of such cooperation in the Central Border Region, as presented in this report, are ones that should be valued and built upon.” CSO research Meanwhile, new demographic information on the Border region released by the Central Statistics Office has shed further light on the region. It shows that 128,106 people live within 10 km of the Border on the Republic side, with 14,205 living within 2 km - classed as a half-hour walk.However, the number of people commuting from this zone across the Border to a permanent job in Northern Ireland was relatively small at just 3,638, or 6.1 per cent of the working age population. This does not include mobile workers such as delivery drivers, or farmers who might farm both sides of the Border, or transport goods or animals across the border on a daily basis.The research shows that people in this 10 km zone are likely to be older than the rest of the state, with some 25.2 per cent of the population aged 55 or over, compared to 24 per cent of the rest of the population. The unemployment rate, at 17.5 per cent in 2016, is higher when compared to the rest of the state (12.9 per cent) for the same year.The CSO also identified that there was a higher vacancy rate among the housing stock within 10km of the border. There were 6,857 vacant dwellings, giving a rate of 12.7 per cent, which rose to 15.7 per cent within 2 kilometres of the Border. This compares to a general vacancy rate across the state of 9.4 per cent. However, the housing stock is generally newer than elsewhere in the country, with 26.9 per cent of dwellings built between 2001 and 2010, compared to a wider figure for the state of 25.4 per cent for the same period. Monaghan is the Border county with the highest proportion of its population living less than 10km from a border crossing, at 64 per cent, followed by 33 per cent in Louth and 22 per cent in Donegal. Just 6 per cent of the population of Leitrim lived within the 10km zone, however. The population across the five counties surveyed increased marginally between 2011 and 2016, by just over 1,300 people.

Photograph: InstagramNadine Lott (30), who died on Tuesday after suffering serious injuries in an attack early on Saturday morning, has been remembered in her home town as a beautiful person with a beautiful nature.The mother of one young daughter was taken to hospital in Dublin after an assault in Arklow, Co Wicklow.On Wednesday the skin care clinic where she worked posted a poignant tribute, saying she was a special person who was much loved by her colleagues and clients alike.“We are all heartbroken about our beautiful Nadine,” read the tribute by the Clearskin Skin and Laser Clinic in the Beacon South Quarter, Sandyford in Dublin.“Nadine was the best colleague she was funny, kind and beautiful both inside and out. She brought sunshine and light to the clinic with her beautiful smile. “You just had to look into Nadine’s big beautiful eyes and you could see her kind soul. Nadine was a very special mum...sister and friend. We all enjoyed listening to her stories. “Nadine had a lot of clients who loved coming into her regularly. She was so enthusiastic and loved to share her passion and knowledge with them about all things skin. Nadine, we are going to miss you so much.”Locals in Arklow said Ms Lott, the eldest of four siblings, came from a respected and popular family, adding the townspeople were struggling to come to terms with her death.She attended a local secondary school, St Mary’s College, Arklow, before studying beauty therapy at the Blackrock Further Education Institute, Dublin. Ms Lott had travelled to Australia in her 20s where she worked in the beauty industry. She was regularly involved in charity fashion shows in the south Wicklow area.Recently, she was among those who took to the catwalk during a fashion show held in the Woodenbridge Hotel and Lodge in Co Wicklow in aid of the Wicklow Hospice Foundation. On Monday, up to 1,000 members of the local community gathered in St Mary’s Park in the centre of Arklow for a vigil to show their support for Ms Lott and her family. The 30-year-old died in St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, on Tuesday. She had been in critical condition since sustaining a number of injuries in an assault at her home in the early hours of Saturday.Wicklow Fianna Fáil TD Stephen Donnelly said: “My deepest sympathies go out to Nadine’s family and in particular her child. I can’t imagine the horror they are going through at the moment.”Local Fianna Fáil councillor Tommy Annesley said: “Nadine was a beautiful girl and beautiful in nature. The family are held in high esteem in Arklow and beyond.”In 2008, Ms Lott was the Festival Queen during the annual Arklow Maritime Festival. On Facebook, a representative of the local lifeboat station paid tribute: “All of us at Arklow RNLI are deeply saddened at the loss of Nadine, we were lucky enough to have gotten to know Nadine when she participated and won the Maritime Queen during our Maritime Festival a few years back. “Our deepest condolences to all of Nadine’s family and friends, RIP.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4118698.1576620709!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo s nonchalance and supply agreement with dara nears an end","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDara Murphy: the former TD for Cork North central ‘formally’ resigned two weeks ago, but was gone in spirit  long before that. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTwo major Government arrangements are falling apart at the seams.One negotiated in the full glare of publicity, the other negotiated in the shadows.The confidence and supply agreement is disintegrating as it nears the end of its natural life. Fianna Fáil’s undertaking to keep Fine Gael in power is a deal with built-in obsolescence.A break-up was always on the cards. And things are getting dirty between both sides now that it’s starting to happen.In the Dáil on Tuesday, Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty compared the two party leaders to squabbling children. He wasn’t wrong.Leo Varadkar’s nonchalance and supply agreement with Dara Murphy – the one where the Taoiseach looks the other way while his double-jobbing TD supplies a Dáil vote – is similarly in bits. What looks suspiciously like the squaring-off of an absentee deputy to retain his vital Government vote in a tight numbers situation is causing considerable pre-election embarrassment to Fine Gael.That little understanding wasn’t designed for public consumption. But it’s shot to infamy and badly bitten Varadkar’s administration. This was never supposed to happen.The Fianna Fáil leader knows his rival for the Taoiseach’s job next year has been damaged by this episode of legitimate brazenness involving a sitting TD collecting full allowances and expenses while working a full-time job in Europe with the express blessing of his boss and party leader.So Micheál Martin revisited the subject again at the start of the Dáil week with the aid of an obscure line from the Ethics in Public Office Act dug up for him over the weekend by a worker bee. He was asking after the former TD for Cork North central, as he pointedly put it, “formally” resigned two weeks ago.He was gone in spirit long before that.Not to be outdone, the Taoiseach retaliated with fresh misdemeanors committed by Fianna Fáil TDs in the Dáil voting shambles, doing his best to open up a new front in the War of the Buttons. Somebody (anything Fianna Fáil worker bees can do, Fine Gael ones can do better) went back through video footage from the Dáil chamber to find more examples of FF TDs pressing colleagues’ voting buttons to pass on to the press.Not only that, charged Leo, but there is a Fianna Fáil Senator (Lorraine Clifford-Lee) “who still hasn’t apologised for some of the remarks” she made nearly a decade ago on Twitter. And another Senator (Keith Swanick) featured recently on RTÉ’s Prime Time for failing to vote in three-quarters of the voting days he was recorded as present.“They aren’t double-jobbing,” the Socialist Party’s Ruth Coppinger reminded him.But the Taoiseach will brook no criticism of his former man in Cork North Central unless he is allowed to hit back with his own criticisms of errant Fianna Fáilers caught indulging in the widespread practice of voting for colleagues who couldn’t be bothered moving the short distance to their assigned seats to press a button.He isn’t comparing like with like, but he is making noise and exuding indignation, and it gets him out of the awkward Dara situation.For his latest Murphy intervention, Micheál seized upon Leo’s RTÉ radio interview on Saturday morning when he said he would find a way to have an independent investigation into his former TD’s performance as a Dáil deputy.“Under sections 9(3) and 9(4) of the Ethics in Public Office Act, there is a facility whereby the former deputy could refer himself to the Members’ Interests committee,” said the Fianna Fáil leader, as if he knew this all along.“Given all you have said on this subject over the last while, I want to ask you, have you actually asked your former colleague to refer himself to the Members’ Interests committee under that legislation and if not, will you so do?”Turn himself in, as it were. How exciting.The Taoiseach indicated he is aware of the provision allowing Dara Murphy to “refer himself”. So, demanded the Fianna Fáil leader, did he ask his former TD to do it?To be fair, this must be very confusing for politicians in general who refer to themselves all the time, which is not the same thing as referring themselves to something.“I am aware that provision exists” repeated the Taoiseach “and we had some discussions with him about it.”Micheál was confused. “Sorry, did you ask him?”With the utmost clarity, Leo replied: “I’ll come back to you on that.”Repeated attempts for a straight answer - “Did you ask him or did you not? You are aware of the provision. Have you asked him to avail of the mechanism?” - finally yielded a positive reply of sorts.“I and my advisers have discussed with former Deputy, Dara Murphy, a number of options as to how an inquiry can be carried out. That is one of the options we have discussed with him and it is something that is still a work in progress.”Still a work in progress. Translation: “Will you refer himself, Dara”. “Go boil your head, Leo.”But make no mistake, the Taoiseach believes “there should be an inquiry” and the former TD “has already agreed that he will submit to an inquiry and I believe he should pay back any expenses if the inquiry finds against him.”Which it can’t, because he has done nothing wrong.It’s like when former TD and senator Ivor Callely was claiming mileage from his “home” in West Cork when he also lived in Clontarf, Dublin. Shameless, but totally within the rules and the system. Ivor was excoriated by his fellow politicians in an Oireachtas committee and denounced in the media but the courts found he was totally within his rights.Dara Murphy is the man they couldn’t investigate. Because they can’t.In the meantime, the Taoiseach will blame the other side for being just as bad.The TDs and senators he named, are they going to be ratified as Fianna Fáil candidates in the next general election, when there is still a cloud of suspicion over them when they are still under investigation. Will you, sir, answer that straight question?Micheál just smirked at him.“Perhaps you may want to come back and comment on that.”Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty was fed up with the bickering. “I think we’re unfortunately going to be subject to a lot of this until the general election. I have a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old at home and I think if they behaved the way the two leaders in the House did I would take them into a corner and have a good talking to them.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4118260.1576601649!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new eu ambassador among appointments approved by government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeclan Kelleher has been a pivotal figure in Irish backroom Brexit dealings in Brussels.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire The North’s Secretary of State Julian Smith is to convene a health summit of party leaders later on Thursday after strike action by nurses and other healthcare workers led to the cancellation of almost 5,000 appointments in Northern Ireland on Wednesday.Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and the Unison, Unite and NIPSA trade unions took part the stoppage in a protest over pay and staffing levels. The strike is due to finish at midnight.In a joint statement, Northern Ireland’s Health and Social Care (HSC) organisations said they had experienced “major disruptions to many services” as a result of the industrial action. Speaking on their behalf, the Chief Executive of the HSC Board Valerie Watts said it had been an “extremely challenging day”.On Wednesday evening she said Trusts were coping but were “reporting significant pressures” in emergency departments and patients were “experiencing lengthier delays than usual at this busy time of the year.” She said she sincerely apologised “to all our patients and services users who have been impacted and distressed by the many cancellations, service closures and disruptions. This is regrettable, and Trusts will ensure appointments are rescheduled as soon as practically possible,” she said. More than 20,000 healthcare workers were present on picket lines across Northern Ireland on Wednesday. They attracted significant support from the public, who sounded car horns and brought strikers tea, coffee and food. “Everybody’s been very positive and everybody is supporting us, they understand the reason why we’re out ,” said nurse Alan Philson, branch secretary with Unison. “We need staff, we need support, we need investment, and it’s been falling on deaf ears for a long time,” he said. Mr Smith said on social media that he was “deeply concerned by the health crisis in Northern Ireland” and the political parties “must address the health crisis as an immediate priority.” But he has also ruled out seeking additional funding from the UK government, saying health was primarily a devolved matter which could be solved “by the parties coming together and moving things forward.” It is understood the summit will ensure that any restored Executive will be able to resolve issues like the health crisis. Northern Ireland has been without a health minister for almost three years, since the devolved government at Stormont collapsed following a row over a renewable heating scheme. Each of the parties has said health is a priority in the current talks aimed at restoring the Assembly. The Chief Executive of one of the North’s HSC Trusts, Seamus McGoran, said he sympathised with staff but urged them to suspend strike action in order force politicians to “step up to the plate”. Mr McGoran, who heads the South Eastern Trust, said “there’s maybe an opportunity to challenge our politicians, and it’s a case of put up or shut up, I suppose.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Donald Trump poised to become third US president in history to be impeached - live updatesScottish Government accused of \u0026#39failure\u0026#39 as it ends Abellio ScotRail contract earlyHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s Sussex title was \u0026#39unfairly acquired\u0026#39 and should be ignored, Brighton and Hove council to considerPuma starts selling £80 shoes for playing video gamesMormon church denies misuse of $100 billion in donationsComment: Turkey\u0026#39s shameful support for Hamas terrorists could provoke a full-scale Middle East warComment: The rise in part-time GPs is a symptom of failureWhy strikes threaten to bring Christmas misery to millions across FranceThousands of commuters stranded in \u0026#39complete mayhem\u0026#39 at London Victoria and London Bridge stations amid major delaysSNP MP crosses fingers while swearing loyalty to the QueenNeighbours kick up a stink over German cheese shopIsraeli MP targeted by Hamas\u0026#39 Istanbul cell calls for sanctions on TurkeyWhat is the timetable for Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit bill?

Two weeks into crippling industrial action that has spread to railways, schools, hospitals, air traffic control, sewage workers and lawyers, government and unions are digging in for a protracted fight to convince the French who holds the keys to saving the country’s embattled social model.With only a quarter of France’s trains running and Paris at a near standstill, there is little room for Christmas cheer among the millions on the receiving end of such blockages.And after the latest day of national protests, the country’s hardline unions have made it crystal clear that there will be no yuletide truce.A vast flower-studded Christmas tree adorns Galeries Lafayette, Paris’ retail powerhouse visited by 37 million shoppers each year.It is normally packed but with the French capital paralysed, sales are down during the crucial festive period.“On December 5 alone, on the first day of the strike, the store posted a 50 per cent drop in revenues (compared to last year),” said Dominique Restino, head of Paris’ chamber of commerce and industry.His phone rings repeatedly as the head of Rungis, Europe’s largest food market, or the boss of a florist giant, vent their angst over the chaos.“In December 2018, the yellow vest movement hit trade in the city centre hard,” said Didier Kling, head of the Paris and Ile-de-France chamber of commerce.“But the demonstrations only took place on Saturdays. This strike is every day, he told Le Parisien.Shops have posted a 30 per cent drop in the Paris area compared to last year. “The risk is that people end up buying less or, worse, that they buy online,” said Mr Didier.Read more from Henry Samuel in his World View, featured in our brilliant Brexit Bulletin newsletterAs for hotels, “Some in Paris and the near suburbs have posted 30 to 50 per cent drop in bookings,” according to Agnès-Pannier-Runacher, junior minister in charge of trade and consumption.In a glimmer of good news, despite transport paralysis, the French postal service was functioning normally.Meanwhile, SNCF, the national rail operator pledged that all 850,000 passengers who had booked tickets over the coming holiday weekend would somehow reach their destination despite the high level of striking drivers.Protesters climb on \u0026#39The Triumph of the Republic\u0026#39 statue depicting Marianne during a demonstration against pension reforms in ParisDespite the mayhem, in a classic French paradox, while a majority feel the pension system must be overhauled and there should be a “Christmas truce”, well over half support the strike - fearful of losing one of the world’s most generous pension systems.On average French workers retire at 63.5 but the age is nearer 60 in the state sector.The publicly-funded pension equal to 74 per cent of their final salary (88 per cent for some railway staff), compared to 29 per cent in Britain. But the current pay-as-you-go system includes 42 pension regimes each with its own perks.French taxpayers pay €8bn (£6.8bn) annually to prop up loss-making ones that allow some to retire in their mid-50s.The new points-based system is fairer, says the government, as each day hour counts for the same pension entitlements across the board. That was not the view among the cohorts of unionists marching in Paris on Wednesday. “We have nothing to say against about this reform apart from it must be scrapped,” said Pierre Lespagnol, 68, a retired rail worker from the hardline Sud union. Stroking his grizzled grey beard, he added: “Macron is playing Thatcher and it won’t wash.”“You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand what the government wants,” said Cyril Zekri, 40, a striking lawyer.“To smash the public service and to put that market into the private sector. The basic state system will be limited and those with money will be able to go to private regimes, like in the UK,” he predicted.Franz-Olivier Giesbert, political commentator in Le Point magazine, said hardline unions’ approach to funding pensions for an ageing population could be summed up by post-war Gallic prime minister Henri Queuille’s famous saying, namely: “There is no problem that an absence of solution cannot solve.”To the uninitiated, the unions’ shock-and-awe tactics suggest they are getting the upper hand.A man holds a banner reading \u0026#34Macron is extremely harmful to our country\u0026#34 Some 615,000, according to police, took to the streets of France on Tuesday in the third such national protest since the strike started on December 5.In an apparent boost, the moderate CFDT, France’s biggest union, joined forces with the hardline CGT for the first time since 2010.Yet the numbers are said to have brought “smiles” to the Macron government, as they fell well short of the hoped million mark.“The unions may have marched in the same streets but they are not on the same wavelength,” said Stéphane Siriot, a historian of French strike action.While the CGT wants the law scrapped, the CFDT backs the reform but wants the government to remove a ratchet that lifts the de facto retirement age to 64.If you stop earlier, your pension falls by five per cent each year.The government is concerned shelving this will deepen the pension deficit and offer a stick to the enfeebled French Right, which has accused Mr Macron of “chickening out” of simply raise the legal retirement age.Both sides have too much to lose to make major concessions, said Mr Siriot.“The unions have failed to score a significant success from a conflict in at least 15 years. Last year, they were marginalised by the yellow vest movement and the government didn’t call on them to seek a compromise.It’s all very well mobilising but they need results. One more defeat would be one too many,” he said.As for Mr Macron: “If he loses this pension reform, he’ll be a lame duck for the next two years.” However, refusing any concession to reasonable unions, was \u0027dangerous\u0027.“The message you send to people is you have to smash everything to get results. It worked for the yellow vests, so why not here? I find it very irresponsible.”On Wednesday, the president finally indicated “improvements are possible” on the de facto retirement age - in an apparent nod to the moderate CFDT.That may help sway public opinion but wouldn’t break striking hardliners, who cut electricity to 100,000 homes this week in protest, Mr Siriot predicted. “For me, we are heading for a long conflict.” Donald Trump poised to become third US president in history to be impeached - live updatesScottish Government accused of \u0026#39failure\u0026#39 as it ends Abellio ScotRail contract earlyHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s Sussex title was \u0026#39unfairly acquired\u0026#39 and should be ignored, Brighton and Hove council to considerPuma starts selling £80 shoes for playing video gamesMormon church denies misuse of $100 billion in donationsComment: Turkey\u0026#39s shameful support for Hamas terrorists could provoke a full-scale Middle East warComment: The rise in part-time GPs is a symptom of failureThousands of commuters stranded in \u0026#39complete mayhem\u0026#39 at London Victoria and London Bridge stations amid major delaysSNP MP crosses fingers while swearing loyalty to the QueenNeighbours kick up a stink over German cheese shopIsraeli MP targeted by Hamas\u0026#39 Istanbul cell calls for sanctions on TurkeyWhat is the timetable for Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit bill?

If any country provides those services - openly or discreetly - they must be sanctioned,” Mr Barakat said in an interview. Israel’s foreign ministry also called on Turkey to shut down Hamas’ base in Istanbul in response to the  report. “Hamas terrorists are directing attacks against Israel from Turkey, while the Turkish leadership is turning a blind eye,” said Yuval Rotem, director general of the foreign ministry.“Israel calls on Turkey to immediately cut its support for Hamas operations out of its territory and to close Hamas\u0027 headquarters in Istanbul.”It also emerged that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, met two alleged UK-based Hamas supporters during a trip to Britain for the Nato summit earlier this month. Mr Erdoğan addressed a rally of supporters of his Justice \u0026amp Development Party in London on December 5. At the same event he also met with Anas Altikriti and Zaher Birawi, who are both prominent Islamists in the UK with links to Hamas. Israel designated Mr Birawi as a member of a terrorist organisation in 2013 for allegedly being part of Hamas’ European office. Photographs show him sitting with Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas. Mr Birawi could not be reached for comment.Mr Erdogan (left) with Mr Altikriti (third from right) and Mr Birawi (second from right)Mr Altikriti is the head of the Cordoba Foundation, which David Cameron once described as the “political front for the Muslim Brotherhood” in Britain. Mr Altikriti has voiced support for Hamas in the past, saying it was “fighting back” against Israeli occupation.  I support the Palestinian people in their struggle for freedom from occupation, Mr Altikriti said. Any support for Hamas stems from them being the democratically elected party in 2006. I would have supported and will always support anyone who fights and wins a free and fair democratic election, regardless of faith, culture or ideology.  Neither man is on a UK list of designated terrorists. Bringing sanctions against its Nato ally Turkey would be a diplomatically fraught move for the US, which has nuclear weapons, aircraft, and service personnel based at Incirlik air base in southern Turkey. The Trump administration has so far shown little appetite for sanctioning Turkey, despite pressure in Congress to punish Mr Erdoğan for his attack on Kurdish forces in northeast Syria. Zacharia Najib, a senior Hamas operative based in Istanbul, suggested Mr Barkat as as an assassination target for a young Hamas recruit who came to Turkey. He told the recruit that he would be remembered if he killed a prominent Israeli. Mr Barkat said he had been contacted by Israel’s security services about an assassination attempt and that his personal bodyguard had been tripled until the authorities were confident the plot had been thwarted.  Mr Barkat was mayor of Jerusalem for ten years and is now a member of parliament for Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party. He is talked about as a potential future prime minister after Mr Netanyahu. Donald Trump poised to become third US president in history to be impeached - live updatesScottish Government accused of \u0026#39failure\u0026#39 as it ends Abellio ScotRail contract earlyHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s Sussex title was \u0026#39unfairly acquired\u0026#39 and should be ignored, Brighton and Hove council to considerPuma starts selling £80 shoes for playing video gamesMormon church denies misuse of $100 billion in donationsComment: Turkey\u0026#39s shameful support for Hamas terrorists could provoke a full-scale Middle East warComment: The rise in part-time GPs is a symptom of failureWhy strikes threaten to bring Christmas misery to millions across FranceThousands of commuters stranded in \u0026#39complete mayhem\u0026#39 at London Victoria and London Bridge stations amid major delaysSNP MP crosses fingers while swearing loyalty to the QueenNeighbours kick up a stink over German cheese shopWhat is the timetable for Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit bill?

A first round of test results is pencilled in for 2021.Bank of England governor Mark Carney described the proposed testing regime as a “a pioneering exercise, which builds on the considerable progress in addressing climate-related risks that has already been made by firms, central banks and regulators”.The financial services industry faces increasing scrutiny over its role in climate change, with an increasing number of insurers and fund managers pulling out of investments in fossil fuel firms.Earlier this month, billionaire hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn warned he would begin taking action against companies that do not do enough to tackle the climate emergency.Sir Christopher, founder of TCI Fund Management, which manages more than $28bn (£21bn) of assets, has sent letters to big companies in which it invests, including Google and Airbus.TCI said it would “typically vote against all directors of companies which do not publicly disclose all of their emissions and do not have a credible plan for their reduction”. The fund manager warned it would consider selling its shares if climate change risks were not properly disclosed.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her majority shareholding makes her one of Britain’s richest people and 244th wealthiest in the world, with a net worth of £9.3bn, according to Forbes.In Bet365’s annual report, Ms\u0026nbspCoates highlighted her charity work, including an £85m donation to her foundation, up from £75m the year before.“The size of the donation, and therefore the difference the foundation will be able to make to people’s lives over the coming years, are of great importance to the group,” she said.Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a think tank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said of Ms Coates’ latest paycheck: “This looks like cynical timing, sneaked out straight after a general election campaign where excess wealth, taxes on the rich and the vast gap between those at the top and everybody else have been key issues.“It’s important that wealth and how it’s created and shared are properly debated. Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people. There’s clearly scope for those who are accumulating such sums to pay higher wages to their workers or contribute more in taxes to fund public services.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This will potentially make it more expensive for banks to finance climate-damaging activity.The bank said the tests\u0026nbspwould allow it to quantify climate change risks to\u0026nbspthe financial system for the first time.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.It is now working out how to design the tests, and expects more details to be published in the second half of next year. A first round of test results is pencilled in for 2021.Bank of England governor Mark Carney described the proposed testing regime as a “a pioneering exercise, which builds on the considerable progress in addressing climate-related risks that has already been made by firms, central banks and regulators”.The financial services industry faces increasing scrutiny over its role in climate change, with an increasing number of insurers and fund managers pulling out of investments in fossil fuel firms.Earlier this month, billionaire hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn warned he would begin taking action against companies that do not do enough to tackle the climate emergency.Sir Christopher, founder of TCI Fund Management, which manages more than $28bn (£21bn) of assets, has sent letters to big companies in which it invests, including Google and Airbus.TCI said it would “typically vote against all directors of companies which do not publicly disclose all of their emissions and do not have a credible plan for their reduction”. The fund manager warned it would consider selling its shares if climate change risks were not properly disclosed.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her majority shareholding makes her one of Britain’s richest people and 244th wealthiest in the world, with a net worth of £9.3bn, according to Forbes.In Bet365’s annual report, Ms\u0026nbspCoates highlighted her charity work, including an £85m donation to her foundation, up from £75m the year before.“The size of the donation, and therefore the difference the foundation will be able to make to people’s lives over the coming years, are of great importance to the group,” she said.Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a think tank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said of Ms Coates’ latest paycheck: “This looks like cynical timing, sneaked out straight after a general election campaign where excess wealth, taxes on the rich and the vast gap between those at the top and everybody else have been key issues.“It’s important that wealth and how it’s created and shared are properly debated. Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people. There’s clearly scope for those who are accumulating such sums to pay higher wages to their workers or contribute more in taxes to fund public services.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In another, a woman who was housebound due to significant disabilities following a stroke was deemed fit to board a removal flight. In both cases, the decisions made on the basis of these assessments were overturned by the courts.Lawyers and charities criticised the firm, which is owned by Dr John Keen, for “churning out findings very quickly” and in some instances “diminishing or downplaying” the severity of applicants’ conditions, sometimes in contradiction to the opinion of their treating doctors.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer gets into the festive spirit at the inland surfing lagoon at The Wave, near BristolSnowy conditions near Deepdale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park as snow hits parts of the UKOisin Carson, 5, picks a Christmas tree at Wicklow Way Christmas tree farm in RoundwoodFirst Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, takes a selfie as she joins the SNPs newly elected MPs for a group photo outside the V\u0026ampA Museum in Dundee, ScotlandPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds arrive back at Downing Street after the results for the general election were announced.

He said NowMedical\u0027s assessment of her case was\u0026nbsp“irrational” and that the council\u0027s view was “tainted” for having relied upon these reports.​Overturning the decision, Lord Justice Smedley said Birmingham Council had not considered all available medical evidence and that the handling of the case displayed “a want of fair-mindedness”. He warned that “care has to be taken by local authorities not to appear to be using professional medical advisers simply to provide reasons for a refusal”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email‘There is something very wrong with this system’: The stories of those affectedIn a more recent example in 2016, an immigration judge rejected a decision by the Home Office to issue removal notice to a\u0026nbspwoman who was housebound due to significant disabilities following a stroke, after NowMedical deemed her fit to fly. A report by the firm had stated that difficulties she faced were “not insurmountable” and that assistance could be provided to her during the flight.\u0026nbspTribunal judge Paulene\u0026nbspGanhdi\u0026nbspallowed the woman\u0027s appeal to the decision, saying she\u0026nbsp“preferred the evidence of her treating specialist who has specifically addressed her ability to travel in light of his detailed knowledge of her medical conditions to that of NowMedical.In 2017, a\u0026nbspcounty court judge allowed the appeal of a homeless woman who was refused housing support by Lambeth Council after being deemed by not to be “significantly more vulnerable than an ordinary person” by NowMedical, despite her GP stating that she was suicidal and would “not cope with being homeless”.Judge Parfitt said the council’s approach, “formed directly from the NowMedical opinions”, was “fundamentally flawed”, adding that it “might have helped” had someone from the medical firm “taken the time to see the appellant or indeed considered her medical records”.NowMedical , which is based in west London, charges local authorities £35 plus VAT for a basic report on whether someone is medically vulnerable enough to get long-term support to prevent or alleviate their homelessness, and is believed to charge the Home Office the same rate to medically assess asylum seekers.Many councils do not have their own medical experts in-house and, while some rely on applicants’ GPs or other medical records, scores across the country opt for using NowMedical’s service. Southwark council paid the company £51,000 last year, while Hackney spent £46,000.Councils have also paid the company to advise on whether housing is suitable. In one case, NowMedical said a first floor flat with a balcony was suitable for the family of a six-year-old girl with severe autism, despite the fact that she had climbed up on the balcony and put herself at immediate risk, saying a fall from that height was “unlikely to be fatal”.Housing lawyers said they feared cash-strapped councils were using the advice of the company as a way of outsourcing tough decisions at a time when low availability of local authority housing meant they were having to place a growing number of homeless people in costly temporary accommodation.Homeless person dying every 19 hours in UK, figures showAsylum seekers left destitute due to \u0027failing\u0027 Home Office contractHome Office makes millions from outsourcing visas to Dubai-based firmHomeless people denied access to basic healthcare, finds studySimon Mullings, a housing law case worker, described the system as “terribly flawed”, adding: “It is obviously a kind of gatekeeping exercise for councils. And it is a very useful, arms-length, quick and cheap way to protect your case workers from the trauma of having to make these decisions on people’s lives.”Victoria Pogge von Strandmann, a public law solicitor at Simpson Millar, said there was a similar system in the Home Office, and that despite the “limitations” of NowMedical\u0027s reports, the department “just seems to follow it blindly”, regardless of what other evidence there might be.She also raised concern that the Home Office did not always provide Dr Keen with all of the relevant medical records for the person being assessed, saying that she had seen cases where “crucial evidence” had not been given to him.“NowMedical’s assessments are pretty cursory in my experience. They are short, amounting to a page or two, they don’t go into massive detail,“ she added. ”They don’t particularly caveat their opinions in the way you would expect when a medical professionals who has been asked to give an opinion only on the papers should do. And the way the Home Office then deals with that information is flawed in my opinion.“Nicholas Nicol, a barrister who has successfully challenged council decisions based on NowMedical assessments, suggested that the apparent frequency at which the firm deemed applicants not to be vulnerable could make the service more attractive to councils.Created with Sketch.The Stats: Homelessness in the UK Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.710 Thousands of families staying in temporary housingAlmost 79,000 families were staying in temporary housing in the last three months of 2017  because they didn\u0027t have a permanent home, compared with 48,010 in the same period eight years before810 Reduction in families living in temporary housing before Coalition governmentThere had been a significant reduction in families living in such conditions before the Coalition government came into power, with the number having fallen by 52 per cent between 2004 and 2010 under the Labour government910 Families staying in temporary has risen sinceBut the figure has crept up in each of the past seven years, from 69,140 in the last quarter of 2015, to 75,740 in the same period in 2016 and 78,930 at the end of last year1010 Nearly 58,000 families accepted as homeless (2018)Nearly 58,000 families have been accepted as homeless by their local council in the past year (as of March 2018), equating to an increase of 8 per cent over the last five years710 Thousands of families staying in temporary housingAlmost 79,000 families were staying in temporary housing in the last three months of 2017  because they didn\u0027t have a permanent home, compared with 48,010 in the same period eight years before810 Reduction in families living in temporary housing before Coalition governmentThere had been a significant reduction in families living in such conditions before the Coalition government came into power, with the number having fallen by 52 per cent between 2004 and 2010 under the Labour government910 Families staying in temporary has risen sinceBut the figure has crept up in each of the past seven years, from 69,140 in the last quarter of 2015, to 75,740 in the same period in 2016 and 78,930 at the end of last year1010 Nearly 58,000 families accepted as homeless (2018)Nearly 58,000 families have been accepted as homeless by their local council in the past year (as of March 2018), equating to an increase of 8 per cent over the last five years“I am not saying there is any conscious bias, but if they continually said this person is vulnerable, well, they just would not be used.

This advice is considered alongside the medical evidence provided by applicants and all other factors.

But they can’t make up s*** about me – and if they do, I have to take it to the courts.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesMs Flint said that Putney and Canterbury – two Labour seats in the south – were not a fair exchange for the dozens of northern seats that had been lost to Boris Johnson.The party had “gone too much towards the metropolitan cities and university towns and away from these core areas and it breaks my heart”, she warned.And she said: “I don’t believe anybody who has been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is credible to be leader.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist.

No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will.

These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So instead he’s issued an inadequate non-apology, claiming responsibility for his “share” of the defeat.His share ! His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote. To make him vote blue again, the Tories need to deliver. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But despite claiming DLA since  she said she was awarded the lower rates of PIP after a  assessment. She waited around a year until, weeks before her appeal tribunal, she said she received a phone call saying sheaposd get the higher rate after all. She told the Mirror: I ended up taking several thousand pounds out of my pension pot.  The stress has been immeasurable. I take pride in what I’m able still able to do. But I now believe I was penalised for trying to keep my independence.” Ms Taylor still works part-time but said I couldnapost be more disabled.

Ms Cooper, who saw her majority in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford slashed from , to , last week, said the party needed to move away from the politics of both Mr Corbyn and Mr Blairit was to win back the support of patriotic older voters who abandoned it for the Tories. Currently odds for Ms Cooper to become the next leader were at  - ahead of Emily Thornberry and Angela Rayner who is likely to go for the deputy leadership instead. We cannot just become a party that is concentrated in cities, with our support increasingly concentrated in erse, young, fast-moving areas while older voters in towns think we arenapost listening to them, she told the Today programme.  I think we clearly do have to change because it hasnapost worked, and weaposve got the fewest Labour MPs since  and a big drop in working-class support with low-income voters choosing the Conservatives even though they didnapost want to, and people felt let down by the choice that we give them, so we have to show some humility, because we got things wrong. Earlier today Emily Thornberry became the first to officially declare her candidacy to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.The shadow foreign secretary revealed that she warned the leader it would be an act of catastrophic political folly to back the doomed election as the party tries to recover from its worst general election result since . Others including shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy have signalled they are considering a bid, while key Corbyn ally Rebecca Long-Bailey is seen as the choice of the current leadership. The race to replace Mr Corbyn following the electoral disaster comes amid a battle over the future identity of the party, with former prime minister Tony Blair criticising Labour for going into the contest with a strategy for defeat. Ms Cooper said she would probably take a dferent view from Tony Blair - who is to use a speech on Wednesday to urge against a whitewash of the partyaposs worst general election result since  - and also a dferent view to the recent approach of the party, adding: There are three things that we are going to have to do now.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Nick Chappelow was just  when he was diagnosed with a rare and crippling form of arthritis .Chronic condition, Ankylosing Spondylitis, means the spine and other parts of the body become inflamed. It affects just seven out of every , people in the UK and levaes sufferers in agonising pain. Chef Nick was forced to control his symptoms with a cocktail of painkillers and medications and he says the never-ending pain made him feel like a ‘wounded animal’. But the -year-old says all that changed when he started taking the blackcurrant supplement, CurraNZ. Nick says his le is now unrecognisable and for the first time in years he has been able to start exercising again because he is no longer in pain. His new lestyle has had another side-effect as Nick has shed a massive six stone. Nick, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, says he hasn’t taken ibuprofen, codeine or paracetamol for more than a year. The father-of-two said: The pain I used to suffer was horrible. When it’s bad, you’re like a wounded animal. You’re snappy. And you have to try and keep it under control. I didn’t want to go out because everything was dficult. But I now feel better than I’ve ever felt before. The blackcurrant supplement has changed everything for me. I was initially sceptical but then saw the product backed by a lot of research, had credible health benefits and was being used by the likes of Premier League sports teams. I saw in the research that it was proven to increase fat burning during exercise, which was another tick in the box for me. It feels like I’m finally in control of my illness and it’s giving me the chance to be healthy and happy again. Married Nick - dad to daughters Chloe,  and Harriet,  - says he has always just thought he had to aposgrin and bear itapos when it came to managing his pain. But he admits he was finding the stress of working in a big kitchen, catering for TV and film productions, increasingly tough.  Nick said: I’ve always been the sort to just get on with it. It wasn’t easy some days, but it’s something that has to be done. I’ve got a family to support and bills to pay, so I just had to push it as much as I could. Nick still takes anti-inflammatory drugs Cimzia and Etoricoxib and well as his supplemeny and he says he was sceptical before he started taking CurraNZ. The product itself contains extract of blackcurrants grown in New Zealand. But within weeks of taking the supplement, Nick says his pain had reduced so much he felt he could join a gym. He said: When I started working out, it was just the bike and the cross trainer for the first three months. But I was able to stick with my new regime and the weight just started falling off. I lost four or five pounds a week, easily. I was a -inch waist and I’m now a  . It’s insane. Nick also shrunk down from  to  stone and says he feels so much better as a result. He added: People take losing weight for granted but when you’re a bit impaired in your ability to exercise it’s harder to do. Doctors say to go swimming, but I found it so hard to do stuff andit got cold my joints used to really stfen up. If I went swimming and stepped out of the pool I would get cold instantly and be achey for the next couple of days, so it puts you off doing anything. It was a vicious circle.  Nick also says itaposs had huge benefits for his family. He explained: It’s been le-changing for us as a family. The other day my daughter was showing me her push-ups, so I was doing them and pushing off the floor and clapping. She was laughing at me - but the things I can do now that I couldn’t do before are amazing.We’ve been clambering over big boulders at a place local to me, called Brimham Rocks, and we’ve also been getting out on the mountain bikes when the weather permits.My youngest daughter does tell me off for doing jumps and stunts - but it’s a world away from where I was a few years ago. People don’t recognise me now. And the dad-of-twoaposs doctor is one of the people most surprised by the change in Nick. Experts have agreed there can be benefits for arthritis sufferers in taking food supplements A spokesperson at Versus Arthritis, the UKaposs largest charity dedicated to supporting people with arthritis, said: When you’re in pain, the thought of exercise can seem unachievable and many people are afraid to exercise because they believe it may cause further damage to their joints. This is not the case. Gentle exercise such as yoga, swimming or walking can help to keep joints healthy, build strength and reduce the symptoms of arthritis.

In a statement from the Welsh Ambulance Service, Chief Executive Jason Killens said: “We were deeply saddened to hear about the death of Ms Gilby and would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her family. We are sorry that our response took longer than we would have liked on this occasion. Our ambulance service exists to care for people, and our staff share the same upset and frustrations as patients and their loved ones at times like this. Lengthy waits for an ambulance are a sign of pressures across the whole unscheduled care system, not just in Wales but across the UK. An increase in high-priority ‘Red’ calls and signicant hospital handover delays in particular are impacting on our ability to respond to  calls as quickly as we would like.

Little Layla was suffering with a high temperature, a headache and a tummy ache in February, . But a doctor dismissed her symptoms and even claimed the rashshe developed was bruises.Determined Kirsty refused to take her dance-mad daughter home and eight hours after she arrived at hospital, Layla went into cardiac arrest and died from meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia.The doctor who treated her, Harsha Rajana, has now been struck off after a General Medical Council hearing found more than  mistakes and dishonest statements proven against him. An internal report carried out by the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust criticised doctors. It stated that Layla-Rose’s mother’s concerns were not listened to, while there were two missed opportunities to recognise the rash. The hearing heard Dr Rajana had failed to consider sepsis , failed to take blood tests and failed to give fluids – and then he lied about his failings.Layla’s mother, Kirsty, , from Oldham, was heavily pregnant with her fourth child when Layla died. She named her son, Laylan, in her daughteraposs memory. Kirsty said: Doctors are wonderful – but a mother’s instinct is invaluable. I knew something was wrong with my daughter but nobody listened. If she had been treated sooner, she would still have been here today. Laylen was born at home, still in the amniotic sac and we feel that he is a gt from Layla. He has given us all a reason to smile and to look to the future. I am pleased that the doctor who saw Layla has been struck off, I have been fighting for justice for her for so long and he will not be able to make the same mistakes with another child, which is a comfort to me. But he lost his job, and we have lost our daughter. How is that fair  Kirsty is now calling for all children to be vaccinated against the disease in her Laylaaposs Law campaign. Layla was Kirsty and her husband Rickyaposs second eldest child and adored by her family.  Kirsty said: Layla was typical girl she loved dancing and she loved dressing up, she liked to look neat and tidy and she always had a bow in her hair. She had a temper too, she was very expressive and fiery. When Layla first started feeling unwell, Kirsty thought it was the same tonsillitis bug her son had. But when the little girlaposs temperature shot up, Kirsty called the NHS helpline. She said: I waited over an hour on hold, so I decided to take her to hospital just to be on the safe side. Layla started being sick when she arrived at hospital and had both stomach pain and a headache. But when she was checked over by a doctor, Kirsty was told to take her daughter home.  She said: I told them I wasn’t happy about taking her home because Layla seemed so unwell. Layla was then seen by a paediatrician who found a red patch on her hip. Kirsty said: I told him it wasn’t a bruise and it had just come out of nowhere. But he said it was a bruise. They started to spread – and I went into panic. Layla was now struggling to breathe and moved to a high dependancy ward and given antibiotics. By now, she had been in hospital over six hours. Kirsty said: The staff still didn’t know what was wrong. They said she had an infection but that was it. At .am, Layla stopped breathing. Kirsty said: I saw the nurses move her pillow quickly and began resuscitation. I was in shock, screaming hysterically. I called my husband who was at home looking after our other children, and he rushed to the hospital but it was too late. Layla died at am on February , . At her funeral, Kirsty played Layla’s favourite songs from her dance shows. Kirsty said: Her death was horrendous for us all. My eldest daughter was heartbroken. My son, Emrae, got a pillow with pictures of Layla on – and he carried it everywhere with him. I was heavily pregnant and the rest of my pregnancy was so hard. Kirsty’s fourth child was born in May,  on her nd birthday. She said: Laylen was born at home, still in the amniotic sac and we feel that he is a gt from Layla. He has given us all a reason to smile and to look to the future.” As well as campaigning for meningitis vaccinations for all children, Kirsty is fundraising for the charity, Meningitis Now. A report into Layla’s death was critical of her treatment in hospital. The report stated that Kirsty brought her daughter to the hospital at around .pm and she was assessed by a triage nurse after a  minute wait. The little girl was identied as requiring a doctor within  minutes but delays meant it was an hour and  minutes before she was seen by a doctor. A rash was spotted on Layla-Rose’s body but the doctor thought it was just a bruise and did not write this information down or speak about it with her mother before telling Kirsty to take her daughter home. A doctor told Kirsty her daughter was fit to go home. But Layla’s mother and a sister nurse in charge felt uncomfortable sending her home and she was instead transferred to the paediatrics ward. After another wait Layla was assessed by a junior doctor, who picked up on the rash on her hip but was told by the previous doctor it was just a bruise and not a new symptom. Just  minutes later another locum doctor noted the rash, inserted a cannula, took bloods and administered antibiotics for sepsis. The rash on Layla-Rose’s body spread rapidly and she then went into cardiac arrest, before she was pronounced dead by medics on the morning of February . A list of missed opportunities in the internal report found doctors used an old document when assessing Layla-Rose, which failed to facilitate the early recognition of potential sepsis. It also stated Layla-Rose’s mother’s concerns were not listened to, while there were two missed opportunities to recognise the rash. The report said: “The doctor who saw the patient initially did not recognise the rash, which was not documented at the time as being of a worrying nature, as a result the diagnosis of sepsis was missed for three and a half hours, during which treatment opportunities were missed. “A second opportunity to spot any rashes was missed when the rash was noted prior to transfer and escalated,  re-assurance was given that this was not a new finding so no action was taken.” The report added there was “failure to identy the advanced nature of the sepsis and treat accordingly” as well as “failure to recognise a ‘bruise’ as a purpuric rash and therefore as an indicator of meningococcal sepsis”. The report recommended doctors require additional training to identy rashes, while staff have been sent a patient alert asking to consider sepsis when diagnosing unwell children.

Scottish SPCA veteran Mike Flynn said a man had kept in his bath tub in a high rise in Leith, Edinburgh. Mike, who has served  years with the SPCA, said he and a colleague were forced to fly to London, pick up another crocodile and then fly on to a crocodile park in Torremolinos, Spain, to ensure the pair of crocs got a forever home. Mike told the Daily Record: “A chap was advertising it for sale and we arranged to meet him in a car park in Edinburgh. “We turned up and had the police alerted and introduced ourselves. He opened the boot of the car and there was this loose five-and-a-half-foot crocodile. It’s classed as a dangerous wild animal.” Mike is now chief superintendent of the charity, which is celebrating  years of saving animals. He has seen some horric sights over the years. In a recent case, a man was going online to find cats, pretending he would care for them but then throwing them to his dogs to get their blood lust up. And Mike has seen several dogs badly injured dogs after they were used for organised fighting. Heaposs even gone undercover to help the fight against badger baiters. And says a major problem is hoarders’ homes crammed with dozens of pets.  The society still mainly cares for dogs and cats – but the numbers of exotic pets being seen, like snakes, lizards and birds, have risen. Mike said: “Going back  years, the biggest problem was red-eared terrapins that came on the back of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There were tens of thousands of these poor things. “They were sold when they were the size of a  pence and kept in a tank. Grown up, they were the size of a dinner plate and people were just dumping them left right and centre. “Then, with Jurassic Park, the next one was green iguanas people were buying when they were at six or seven inches long for £.”  If the pet shop didn’t tell people how to feed them and give them proper light, they would absorb their own bones to get calcium and develop metabolic bone disease. Mike remembers one visit to a house where there were  caged dogs. He said: “It was abysmal. As soon as we’re aware of something, we’ll go and check it out and do what we can. We do need the public to be our eyes and ears.” He said organised dog fighting and badger baiting can cause horric injuries – with dogs having half their faces ripped off. And the illegal puppy farming trade is a big problem. He said: “We’ve always had dog fighting and badger baiting but it’s becoming more prevalent now. “The one sad thing about the Scottish SPCA is that I don’t think we’ll ever do our job. “Although Scotland is a fantastic nation of animal lovers, you’re always going to get a percentage of people that think neglecting animals is their right.” But Mike’s also seen animals brought back to health.

These toys should have been packed away in boxes, or strewn across the floor for little hands to play with. But instead they form a heartbreaking shrine to the two children who should have received them – but who died in a house fire just days before Christmas. Jade, , and Alex, , perished in the blaze on December , , but their little brother Nathan, then , miraculously escaped along with his mum and dad. Speaking about the tragedy for the first time, mum Mandy, , said: “One of the only things that survived the fire were the kidsapos Christmas presents. They were hidden away in a cupboard. Weaposve kept them all this time. “My one wish every year is to be able to give Jade and Alex those presents. But I know I never can.” Remembering that night, their dad Andrew, , said: “Every Christmas we all lit up our houses to raise money for charity. “Our street became known as Christmas Street. People used to travel  miles to see it. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror  “That night, my we and I were sitting downstairs watching TV. At about .pm we heard this massive bang and the lights went out. “Smoke was coming from the dining room. “I shouted aposfireapos and ran to the kids. “Smoke was everywhere and it was inky dark. The smoke alarm was ringing. “Jade was standing at the top of the stairs. I grabbed her hand and turned towards the boysapos room.  “The boys were sat in bed crying. We could barely breathe. I opened the bedroom window and got out on the window sill shouting for help. “I was still holding my daughteraposs hand but her hand left my grip. “I turned to look for her when a neighbour, who had just climbed a ladder to get us, pulled me out of the room. “We both fell about ft and landed on the car below.  “I tried to stand up but I collapsed. “The house was in flames and the windows were popping. “Mandy was screaming aposI want my babies!apos while neighbours held her back from the burning house. “I was having dficulty breathing and the back of my throat was burning. Everything was going very fast but moving in slow motion at the same time. “It felt like I was trapped underwater. There was a man shouting in my face but I couldnapost hear him.  “One man ran out of the house with his coat on fire. He was holding our youngest boy Nathan. “Our daughteraposs body was later found in the bathroom. She must have been disorientated by the smoke and turned right when she left the boys room instead of heading for the stairs. Our oldest lad stayed curled up in bed tucked under his duvet. “Only Nathan turned down the stairs.”  Andrew was taken to Barnsley hospital where he was later told that both Jade and Alex had died. “I kept thinking I should have held Jade tighter,” Andrew said. “Itaposs a fatheraposs responsibility to protect his children and I wish I could have protected them that night. “I watched every news broadcast in the hospital that week, seeing what happened to the kids. The fire was all over the news at the time. I canapost explain why I needed to watch it but I did. I had to watch all these people talking about my kids.  “Nathan was in intensive care in Leedaposs Hospitalaposs burns and fire unit for one week in an induced coma and on le support. “My we had been treated for smoke inhalation but was discharged quickly so she could be with Nathan. Mandy said: “I still had visions of losing him too until he came out of the coma. “I used to sit by his bed holding his hand and praying that he would be OK. I kept saying aposmummy loves you.apos”  Andrew said: “The fire was a Monday and the following Sunday they took Nathan off le support. “We all stood around his bed waiting for him to wake up. His first words were aposmummaapos. “He had blisters and scars on his hands where he had been burned. “The trauma and stress caused his mind to blank out. He canapost remember anything before the fire. “He knew he had a brother and a sister but he couldnapost remember them. “I think it protected him.  “When he came home and saw photos of them he never asked aposwhoaposs that apos “He knew he had a brother and sister but he just didnapost know who they were. “Theyaposre buried together. Alex was in a camouflage coffin because he loved Action Man and Jade was in a Barbie pink coffin. Everyone cried as their coffins were lowered into the ground.” A post mortem found that Jade and Alex both died from smoke inhalation, but the pathologist said the youngsters had received such extensive burn injuries that they would have been unlikely to survive.  An inquest into the childrensapos deaths heard how although it was clear that the fire started near a fibre optic Christmas tree, it was impossible to say what exactly had sparked the blaze. The hearing in Sheffield was told there was no evidence that the electrical system at the house was overloaded or dangerous. The Yorkshire Post reported that Coroner Chris Dorries recorded a verdict of accidental death on Alex and Jade. He said the family had suffered a tragedy in its most terrible form adding: “What we know is that the blaze started in the corner of the dining room and we know there was electrical equipment in that corner.”Some of the electrical items, including a fibre optic tree, had melted in the blaze and could not be examined. But, other items recovered were proven not to have been the cause of the fire. “I think from what has been said that the cause of the fire was electrical in nature, but whether it was an item or was related to the wiring I do not know.”    Walking into their fire-ravaged home after their deaths was dficult for Andrew and Mandy, but some things miraculously survived the inferno. “Our house was gutted,” Andrew said. “You could see the sky where the roof used to be. “But we got a few things. “We still have their Christmas presents. Theyaposre one of the few things that survived the fire. “And a council worker found Jadeaposs ring in the ashes. My we wears it around her neck now  . She never takes it off. “Everything  down to the teaspoons had to be replaced. “People from all over the world sent us letters and donations. “David Beckham donated a shirt for a fundraising auction, a world-champion boxer donated gloves and Frankie Dettori donated jodhpurs. “My we and I didnapost go to the inquest, our family went and told us what happened at it. “They said it was probably an electrical fault somewhere in the wiring. But there wasnapost enough of the house left to conclusively say how the fire started. “Originally we thought it was the lights on a Christmas tree. But they ran tests which showed that nothing had overloaded, they donapost think it was the Christmas lights that sparked it but some internal wiring. “They donapost have a reason for the fire and the coroneraposs verdict was accidental death.”  Just days after the first year anniversary of Jade and Alexaposs deaths, Mandy found out she was pregnant. Mandy said: “I found out I was pregnant on Christmas Day the following year. I had a big smile on my face when I told Andrew that the test was positive. “But I was happy and sad at the same time. I was trying to be happy for Nathan at Christmas, I was happy to be pregnant but I was thinking about Alex and Jade all the time too.” “We called her Ellie-Ja,” said Andrew. “We agreed that Ja, for Jade and Alex, would be part of her name. “She looks just like her sister. “She couldnapost tell who was who when she looked at pictures of them both when she was younger. “And she speaks exactly like her brother did.  “She never met them but from the time she could talk you could hear her talking to them at night. “She never remembered it but we could hear her. So we know theyaposre around. “Ellie is  now. When things happen to her and people say aposyou must have aAngel,apos she says, aposactually I have two.apos “Sheaposs been hit by cars twice but survived.  “She feels very close to them. Every time she walks past the graveyard she leaves some coins on their headstone.” The fire broke out at their former home on John Street, Thurnscoe, South Yorkshire, but the family has since moved to a bungalow in Goldthorpe which is easier for his we Mandy, who has mobility issues, to manage. Both parents have tattoos in memory of their children – their skin etched indelibly with their names and pictures of hearts. Surviving brother Nathan, , has a clock with its hands pointing to the exact time the fire struck taking his siblingsapos lives.  The familyaposs Christmas traditions of decorating the tree and leaving out mince pies for Santa are no more. Instead, the family will visit Alex and Jadeaposs grave on December . “I used to love Christmas,” said Mandy. “All the lights and everything. But as the kids have grown up we celebrate Christmas less and less. Last year we didnapost have a tree. Mandy and Andrew say le without Jade and Alex has been very, very dficult. Both parents have been plagued by depression and PTSD but they have managed to keep going thanks to Nathan and Ellie-Ja.

Jessika Jones said her family has no heating or lighting and canapost use their kitchen appliances when the power trips in their chalet on a travellersapos caravan site in Middlesbrough. The single mum, who is due to give birth to her third child on Friday, said she has had to wrap her kids in layers of clothing to keep warm and has been feeding them sandwiches. Ms Jones, , told TeessideLive that said she was forced to bin £ worth of food, including meat for the familyaposs Christmas dinner, after her fridge freezer went off. She claims Middlesbrough Council has done little to help her, so she has resorted to contacting social services for help. Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror Ms Jones, who is mum to sons Malachi-Francis, five, and William-Boxer, one, said: We have reported it to social services and they said we have got to phone the council again. Having to report yourself to social services because of the welfare of the children - I think itaposs disgusting. I have got to show the council that I canapost live like that.  I feel like they donapost care. We just keep reporting it and they just keep fobbing me off to someone  all the time. Itaposs made me feel like I canapost provide for my children. I canapost feed them property or put a warm meal in their tummy. Iaposm just at the end of my tether, I donapost know what  to do. Ms Jones said the council is responsible for the site, but Thirteen Group deal with any out-of-hours issues.  She claims she and others on the site were left without electricity at the weekend. Ms Jones said she rented a generator for £ and it cost her £. in diesel for just one night, so she cannot afford to use it anymore. She added: The electricity is tripping all the time. For the out of hours people to come it takes two hours. Every time it trips it is taking money from me. Itaposs not asitaposs cheap to live on here. Itaposs still £ a week and we own our own homes. We have got the same as what a house would have. I saved £ for my Christmas food. I had been to the butchers and got my meat. My electricity went off over the weekend and my meat started to thaw out.  I canapost afford to spend that again. I wonapost be able to have a Christmas dinner with my kids. I am having to feed my kids sandwiches or anything you can make without electric. My children canapost have their Christmas lights on, they canapost watch Christmas films as we canapost have the telly on. We have got no lights, we have been using torches on our phones. Itaposs Christmas and they want the pretty lights on the trees - itaposs not fair. Iaposm eight months pregnant and due to have my baby on Friday. I canapost come home from hospital with a baby. I have to warm up bottles and I canapost leave them at room temperature as itaposs freezing.  We are wrapping up, there is nothing  we can do. We are wearing dressing gowns, socks, two pairs of pyjamas. I have had to put the children in bed with me. We shouldnapost have to do that. What do they expect us to do  Really, I think itaposs discrimination because we are live-in travellers. Ms Jones settled in Middlesbrough about two years ago after travelling with her childrenaposs father, to whom she is now separated from.

The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in the hopes that Boris Johnson would find something to spare. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while dreams about food banks danced in their heads... and the grown-ups tried, very hard, not to talk about politics. In the past four years there’s been nothing but bitching. About migrants, wheat fields, Jean-Claude Juncker, and first Parliament had no sovereignty and then too much of it. It’s got so that,Noddy Holder burst onto the telly shouting “It’s BREEEEEEXIIIIT!” the whole country could be tipped into violent reprisals.

Marriages and relationships have been strained, families put at loggerheads, with Remainers and Leavers, Tories and Corbynistas at each other’s throats.

The totaposs death is believed to be related to a bronchial infection. Her devastated parents, Mike and Jodie, who have three other children Taylah, Jack and Imogen, had noticed Eliza had a high temperature on December , and treated her with prescription medication. The same week their older children, aged four and six years old, had been off school sick, and they believed Eliza had caught the same bug. Elizaaposs temperature was kept under control with medication, and Mike and Jodie believed she was recovering as she was eating and drinking. Her parents are now desperate to raise awareness of the killer infection. Mike said: Just over  hours ago our daughter Eliza died from what looks to have been septicemia.Initially we thought it had been brought on by meningitis - turns out that itaposs just been a bronchial infection.She was just two years and nine months old.  We like to think we are educated, experienced parents. We had four children. Weaposre both trained in paediatric first aid, we know the signs. Our kids have had ious dferent health issues, amongst them Eliza had hearing loss and she needed glasses - she loved wearing them. A week ago our four-year-old was sent home from school, feeling tired and jaded.  She slept for the rest of the day and was otherwise fine. The following day our six-year-old vomited at school and was obviously sent home. He took an hour to recover and was fine from that point on. On Thursday lunchtime, Eliza was running a temperature at nursery, so we brought her home. She was happy and bright enough, and the following day we planned to take her back to the nursery with prescription medicine to keep her temperature under control.  In the end we decided to take her with us where we had a travel cot made up for her. She was happy enough, slept on and off for the day, and we were able to keep her temperature under control through the medicine. At this stage we just thought she had the same bug that the other two kids had had earlier on in the week. On Saturday she still had a bit of a temperature, but she was asking for food and drinks and playing with Lego at  oaposclock. At one oaposclock she started to show a bit of purpura, a discolouration of the skin caused by inflammation.  Hours before her death Eliza had been playing with Lego at the family home in Rhu, Argyll and Bute in Scotland. When her health deteriorated her parents rushed her to the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, but tragically Eliza could not be saved. She was rushed to hospital but had died before we could get there, Mike said. Hospital staff did all they could but there was nothing that they could do.  Our family, friends and community have been fantastic in support, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. In an emotional video plea, tearful Mike said: But we have one more favour to ask you, and to anyone watching this video - spread this message far and wide. If by telling our story we can ensure just one personaposs le is saved, one family is saved from this pain, Elizaaposs death will not be without reason. Generous donors have raised more than £, for the grieving family, who run a nursery in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute.  A spokesman for Police Scotland said: Around .pm on Saturday, December , a two-year-old girl took unwell within her home in Rhu, Helensburgh. She was taken to the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria, where she died a short time later. Her family is aware and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.

Wind and rain are expected today along the west coast as high as Glasgow and southern parts of the country. These warnings remain in place for Thursday when a rain warning is also in place for eastern areas of Scotland in between Aberdeen and Dundee. On Friday, there are no wind warnings but those for rain remain in place for south west England and parts of east Scotland. On Saturday and Sunday rain warnings are concentrated along the south cost of England. Wales is set to be amongst areas hit with heavy rain and is subject to a three-day weather warning, with flooding and travel disruptions likely. A previous warning for rain has been extended to cover the whole of south and west Wales and parts of mid Wales up to Welshpool. Heavy downpours were set to move into west Wales earlier today before spreading across the country by mid afternoon.  And those hoping for a white Christmas are likely to be disappointed, however.The Met Office said it is too early to predict the weather for Christmas Day, though temperatures are expected to be milder than they have been so far this week.Yesterday a spokesman told thetemperatures this December th are also likely to be milder than in recent years. Ice and fog warnings issued are expected to expire today but fog could remain in some areas, including Lincolnshire and the Vale of York. But yellow warnings for rain and wind will remain until the early hours of Thursday morning.  Bonnie Diamond, a meteorologist with the Met Office, said: Thereaposs an area of low pressure in the Atlantic thataposs pushing in from Ireland eastwards later today and thataposs going to bring strong winds and coastal gales to south west England and Wales, the winds turning increasingly strong through later today and also heavy rain. So thereaposs quite a few warnings in place at the moment. Ms Diamond said the winds will continue to strengthen today and will be strongest across Northern Ireland, western Wales and south west England. Gusts could reach -mph in coastal areas and high ground, while inland, gales will be around -mph. Heavy rain will affect the same areas before pushing eastwards across the rest of the UK.  Ms Diamond said: So really quite an unsettled  hours ahead with the main impact being felt across western parts of the country in terms of rain and strong winds. Rain warnings are currently in place in parts of southern England on Friday and Saturday, and Ms Diamond said it is likely these warnings will increase in area. She said: It looks like quite a broad area of southern England is likely to get quite a lot of wet weather over the next couple of days and there could be local impact in terms of flooding with that amount of rain over consecutive days.

Neyleen Ashley, , from Miami, Florida, met her ex-boyfriend, who has not been named, through mutual friends back in . She thought he was immature at first and was’t suitable for her long-term, but her affection for him grew and things soon became serious. Neyleen saw numerous red flags during their long-distance relationship, but would sweep it under the rug as she was completely smitten by him. Neyleen said: “My feelings about him were that he was very immature and not ready to settle down, but then as things progressed the feelings grew and eventually we became very serious about each other, but I always saw red flags, being that we were in a long distance relationship things were easy for him to keep under wraps. “He would never post me on social media, and he was very secretive about his phone. I always posted him on my stories and made it known I was in a relationship, and my phone was always at his disposal.” Neyleen helped pay for all her partneraposs expenses – but was none the wiser as he saw other women behind her back. Neyleen had a hunch something was wrong and admitted their relationship was always “rocky”, but she said her caring nature often took over and she became blind-sided to his behaviour. She added: “Our relationship was always rocky. He never made me feel secure as a woman, or that I was worth anything. “I figured dating a normal man from a small town that he would be in ‘awe’ of me, but he treated me like I was anyone . “At the time he was trying to get his le in order so I was the sole money maker towards the end of the relationship, and he used my money and his free time to see prostitutes, go to massage parlours or even have another girlfriend in another city.  “He left me to see these prostitutes on my mother’s birthday knowing how stressed I was, and wouldn’t even talk to me on my birthday or post anything because he didn’t want his other girlfriend to see.” One day, Neyleen’s boyfriend noticed her boyfriend’s Apple Watch buzzing repeatedly with notications while he was outside their home. Out of curiosity, she decided to check it up and was mortied to find pictures of a girl in lingerie along with dozens of messages from prostitutes. She soon found out he had been corresponding with these girls for months and was meeting prostitutes every week since they had started dating. She said: “I found out he cheated because I had a hunch for a long long time, I am very intuitive and I knew something was off. Although I wanted to trust him, I felt like I was getting taken advantage of. Not only financially, but personally because I’m such a loving and caring person.  “One day I was home and he was washing his truck outside, I saw his Apple Watch going off buzzing and buzzing and buzzing. I got curious because I saw a small square that looked like a picture of a girls butt in underwear and I opened it. “In utter shock and disbelief, I find numerous attempts to meet prostitutes at massage parlours, hotels and their home. “One girl even said ‘I can’t my parents are home’. “I saw numerous girls sending him pictures on his birthday, and texts from his ex as well. “I then decided to take the Apple Watch with me and I left the house and parked by a spot with open land close to my house because I could not breathe. “I kept investigating and I found messages and calls from one specic number, I saw messages saying ‘I wanted to fuck you’ the same day he left me and told me he loved me. “I saw messages saying how much he missed her and liked her, all while he never acknowledged my presence and often left me with arms wide open when trying to hug him goodbye or hello.  “I found out that he had a whole other girlfriend for several months, side chicks, talking to his ex and meeting with multiple prostitutes weekly. Neyleen decided to confront her boyfriend at the time, but downplayed her concerns. After their break up, Neyleen claimed her ex begged her toand even contacted her friends and family to convince her he had “changed”. However, Neyleen said she has no plans of going back to him and now hopes move forward with her le on a positive note.

While it might seem like a wonderful le at the time, the morning after can be a dferent story, thanks to the biggest Grinch of all – a holiday hangover. And with shopping to do, family to see and work to wrap up before the end of the year, thereaposs no time for staying in bed. So, what hangover cures really work  From a full fry-up to hair of the dog, we take a look at what you need to do to make yourself feel better and have a very merry little Christmas... Myth: Have a fry up After a heavy night, itaposs normal to wake up craving carbs – and a greasy fry-up certainly ticks all the boxes. But health experts warn that itaposs best not to bring home the bacon. For, drinking causes you to lose nutrients through urine – and a heavy breakfast could trigger indigestion. As a result, a more nutritious breakfast can help you battle a hangover more quickly. Fruit, such as bananas, can help restore potassium and blood sugar levels. Or,that seems a little too zesty, then honey on toast is also easy for the stomach to digest. Myth: Hit the gym Some people may swear by a sweaty gym class to perk them up after drinking too much – but this can actually do more harm than good, as your body is already dehydrated. Instead, itaposs better to go for a brisk walk in the fresh air to release endorphins and improve circulation, in a gentler way.  Myth: Take a painkiller before bed Think that taking a painkiller before bed will stop any impeding hangover  You couldnapost be more wrong. Most over-the-counter painkillers take  minutes to start working and the results only last a few hours. So, by the time you wake up itaposs likely that you wonapost be able to feel any effects. On top of this, painkillers can mix with the gastric acids created by alcohol in your stomach – which could cause damage to your stomach lining. So,you really need to pop some pills, itaposs best to wait and assess your situation in the morning. Myth: Coffee cures all When youaposre feeling sluggish it can be tempting to reach for the coffee for a bit of a buzz. But although coffee isnapost quite as dehydrating as alcohol, it is still a diuretic and could hinder your recovery. If you really need a caffeine hit, try to stick to just one cup before switching back to water.  Myth: Gorge on late night takeaways Itaposs bad news for those who like to end the night with a burger and chips. For, while it may seem like a good way to soak up excess alcohol, fast food can actually irritate your stomach and cause you to put on weight. Instead, itaposs better to eat a big meal before heading out – to line your stomach before drinking alcohol. Myth: Keep going Continuing to drink may delay your hangover but it certainly wonapost stop it. So, itaposs best to have some water with your breakfast rather than an early-morning beer.

He is one who will be here for a while. We will get it sorted soon.“Fin is in the team because he deserves to play. That’s why he has played the majority of our games this season, it’s because he has been excellent.“He has made  appearances and most of them have been starts.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

I remain steadfast in the Union’s position that in our future EU and international trade agreements there must be no double standards of what is expected of Scottish and UK producers and what is tolerated from imports and their production methods and standards.‘It is not just the economics that is at stake here # there is the triple bottom line of sustainability, social economics and what Scottish farmers and crofters can deliver for the environment including climate change’."},{"url":null,"title":"post election action from nfu scotland","story":"Before the dust of the General Election had settled, NFUS kick-started an extensive programme of engagement with Scotland’s intake of MPs and the new UK government.NFU Scotland has written to every MP in Scotland, inviting them to early meetings to make progress on the  key priorities set out in its election manesto documentThis addresses the pressing Brexit issue, as well as climate change, animal welfare, opportunities for new entrants and food producers’ standing in the supply chain.NFU Scotland will also extend an invitation to the Secretary of State for Scotland, once appointed, to attend and address the upcoming NFU Scotland AGM in February next year.Clare Slipper, NFU Scotland’s political affairs manager, said: ‘With the dust from last week’s election settled, now begins the hard work with Scotland’s representatives in Westminster.‘Let us be clear: NFU Scotland will engage with all MPs, of all parties, to ensure the best outcomes for our membership.‘As well as organising meetings with Scottish MPs, we are also seeking early engagement with key appointments within the government.‘Having looked at the policies within the Conservative’s manesto line-by-line, there are areas of strength and opportunity and other areas that our members will find more challenging.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10792049.jpg?type=article-full","title":"neil-mackay-englands-voice-heard-now-scotlands-turn","story":"English nationalism has got its way. Brexit is coming, and Boris Johnson is in Number . The triumph of English nationalism at the General Election is a great threat to Scotland, and will cost us dearwe do not resist it with every democratic means at our disposal.Not only does Scotland have to face being ripped from the European Union against the will of the nation, but we also have the injustice of Westminster silencing the democratic voice of the Scottish people.The SNP won an astonishing majority of seats at the election. It fought a campaign which hammered home that the nation was lied to at the last independence referendum ndash that we were misled when we were told a No vote was the only way to preserve EU membership. After the EU referendum, circumstances obviously changed and a second independence vote was morally justied. The SNP won on this premise ndash yet wersquore told by Johnson therersquoll be no second independence referendum.Brexit alone is grounds enough for a second independence referendum. The SNPrsquos electoral mandate makes the argument unassailable.An election which confirms the democratic will of the English people is being used to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people. Would the English tolerate such abuse  Itrsquos not hyperbole to say the treatment of Scotland in the first few days of the new Johnson administration smells of tyranny and bodes ill for the future. Itrsquos a clear-cut case of political injustice.This treatment is designed to provoke anger. The Yes movement needs to resist being needled into intemperate behaviour. Already, some voices on the fringes of the Yes movement, or within the SNPrsquos more hysterical base, have began talking of action like a unilateral declaration of independence.Such language is not welcome. The reason the SNP did so well in this election is that the broader Yes movement followed a policy of moderation over the last four years. The leadership wisely avoided the flag-waving, old-school nationalist marches of outfits like All Under One Banner, which seems to attract more than its fair share of cranks and zealots.:Yes vote would be more disruptive after Brexit than in \"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"description\": \"Ian Blackford: Not a good look for Boris Johnson to ignore second Scottish independence referendum calls\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ncqRYhbm poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ncqRYhbm.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Leaders of the SNP and the Yes movement chose to focus on a policy of wooing undecided Scottish voters and soft No voters. It was emollient, open, nuanced, intelligent and unaggressive.The tactic seemed to represent the split in the SNP and the Yes movement mirrored by the personalities of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. Those of a populist persuasion still pine for the bluster of a man like Salmond. This is the brittle SNP base, represented by the online, angry fringe. They achieved nothing in this election. They won over not a single voter. Itrsquos likely thatthey didnrsquot exist at all, the SNPrsquos majority would be even higher than it is today.What secured the SNP electoral victory was the careful, modulated, well-mannered message put out by the leadership. Nicola Sturgeon may have briefly lost her usual dignied composure when she jumped for joy at the sight of Jo Swinsonrsquos defeat on election night politics is played to be won after all but the consistent message throughout the campaign was measured, unthreatening and reassuring.As a result, soft unionists and undecided voters have leant their support to the SNP in order to register opposition to Brexit and Johnsonrsquos hard-right politics. Thatrsquos an act of great trust and they should be applauded for their political bravery. They mustnrsquot be betrayed. Theyrsquove taken the first step on a new journey and must be encouraged towards full support of independence.The policy of moderation has also left the Scottish Labour Party seemingly on the verge of rethinking its entire position on the constitution. Along with continually pressing for moderation among the Yes movement, Irsquove also spoken in this column of the need for Labour to moderate its position on Scottish independence. Today, senior Labour figures are now in favour of a second referendum.The SNP and the Yes movement now sit securely atop the moral high ground. The battle was fought with decency and it paid off. Meanwhile, Johnson and his government treat Scotland with contempt yet we cannot allow understandable anger to undermine that moral high ground.My first emotional reaction to Johnsonrsquos denial of a second referendum was anger. Not only did I feel Scotland was now a hostage to his government ndash hijacked and taken in the boot of his car to Brexitland ndash but the hypocrisy was astonishing. England can get its way, but not Scotland ndash that was the message. Democracy for England do as yoursquore told for Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon at the Glasgow count during the General Election  :Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for For a few hours I felt the only answer was to call another referendum whether Westminster liked it or not. But some calm reflection proved just what folly that would be. All the hard work of moderation and measure would be for nothingwe allow ourselves to be riled and act emotionally. Letrsquos avoid the road to Catalonia.The Yes movement must continue the policy of moderation here at home ndash in order to maintain momentum and trust ndash but when Scotland directs its face to Johnson in London there must be only implacable resistance and demand. If Johnson intends to harm Scotland by preventing our voice being heard, then harm him back. Obstruct his government in any way possible. Take his government to courtneeds be to secure a second referendum.Conservative hostility, however, means itrsquos highly unlikely that wersquoll see another referendum until after the next Holyrood election ndash theyrsquoll ly deny any mandate exists until success in  makes such fiction no longer sustainable.What matters most is sustaining that intelligent and dignied composure at home, while never relenting when it comes to fighting the hypocrisy and abuse of democracy emanating from London.

Ronnie Torrance, the drummer, had left all his spare skins in the studio in Brussels, so we had to carry on without a snare and improvise for about four songs. Fortunately for us, Lene Lovichrsquos road crew were there, and they lent us their snare drum. Listening to it again, Ronnie copes with it amazingly well. When it broke, it made things seem kind of hard. It was quite a prestigious gig, I remember. We were only playing a short set, but it wasnrsquot a nightclub. It was a theatre set up, and was quite formal and quite staid.The unintended snare drum incident nevertheless gives the recording of Josef Krsquos April  performance an extra edge that can be heard on The Scottish Affair , a lavishly packaged record of the show released on limited edition clear vinyl by Les Disques du Crepescule. The chic Belgian label promoted the concert at the Beursschouwburg venue in Brussels following a multi-media extravaganza on Hogmanay four months earlier. That was at the warehouse-based Plan K alongside Postcard Records label-mates Orange Juice.Josef K had released their debut single, Chance Meeting, on Orange Juice drummer Steven Dalyrsquos Absolute label. Their two follow ups on Postcard, Radio Drill Time and Itrsquos Kinda Funny, mixed angular urgency with downbeat lyrics that made for a kind of existential disco.With Crepescule forging international connections, Josef K had recorded their Sorry for Laughing single for them during their first visit. This captured the raw sound that had eluded them on previous recordings, including that of the album that was awaiting release. They decreed to re-record it in Brussels during their second visit, and it was this that was released as The Only Fun in Town, its seemingly self-sabotaging release foreshadowing the bandrsquos split in August.Ross remembers the Brussels trip as having ldquoa real sense of optimism and excitement that things were moving forward. We did feel we were part of a kind of change of the guard in terms of what was going on musically. Josef K would always try and do something, not totally experimental, but not just the same things that wersquod done before. We were so young then, and I think we were quite naiumlve, trying to find new chord structures and all that, then as you get older and learn more, you realise why theyrsquore structured the way they are.Europe may seem an increasingly distant place right now for a new generation of home-grown talent with ideas above their station. For Haig, Ross and the other members of Josef K, drummer Torrance and bass player Davy Weddell, their first trips abroad as part of what was effectively a trans-global Crepescule salon, it was an adventure. The bandrsquos name may have been drawn from Czech novelist Franz Kafkarsquos existential novel, but Brussels seemed just as exotic.ldquoPaul and I used to read European literature in translation, remembers Ross, ldquoand we always felt we had an affinity with Europe.The European romance they envisaged was slightly dferent from the harsh realities of le on the road. ldquoWe did that terrible journey in a Bedford van, with loads of things going wrong, says Haig, ldquobut when we got to Brussels, it was great to just be able to to a cafeacute and have a proper French coffee. We liked our coffee and cigarettes, but you couldnrsquot get that it Scotland. Then we met the Crepescule crowd, and they had it much more together than we did. They all had flats and everything, and we were these pale little Scottish guys pretending to be sophisticated.The album cover image for The Scottish Affairis a reproduction of the poster for the Beursschouwburg gig, featuring artwork by Jean-Francois Octave that epitomised the ennui of serious young men. The -odd minute recording itself captures Josef K at their frenetic peak.ldquoSome moments sound really intense, says Haig. ldquoItrsquos always a bit weird going back, because it feels like a letime ago, but I think it stands up.Once Josef K split, Haig formed Rhythm of Le, a loose-knit umbrella organisation that produced a couple of singles before releasing numerous albums under his own name. Having briefly come up for air a decade ago for a handful of rare live dates, Haig continues to release new material, with his most recent album, The Wood, released last year on Les Disques du Crepescule.Ross joined Orange Juice, then Aztec Camera before embarking on a solo career that saw him release two albums. He made an album with The Low Mfs, and is currently part of The Bum-Clocks with Fire Engines drummer Russell Burn and his actor brother Tam Dean Burn. The Bum-Clocks also form part of Out of the Ordinary, the Edinburgh supergroup put together by maverick singer and composer, Joseph Malik.Both Haig and Ross express surprise at Josef Krsquos increasing cache over the years. This has come about through ious compilations, name-checks as an influence by the likes of Franz Ferdinand and their appearance in Grant McPheersquos Scottish post-punk documentary, Big Gold Dream. The release of The Scottish Affairadds to the historicising of their brief but vital lespan.ldquoI think for people interested in music of that period itrsquos an interesting document of its time, says Ross.For Haig, ldquoI think itrsquos quite an important document of what we were like that night, and because itrsquos a live experience it gives people who never had the chance to see Josef K an idea of how fast and intense it all was. Listening to it now, sometimes it takes me back, and sometimes itrsquos quite uncomfortable, but you really get the feeling it was a special night.The Scottish Affairby Josef K is available now on Les Disques du Crepescule. www.lesdisquesducrepescule"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-urges-unity-among-parties-new-independence-referendum","story":"The First Minister appealed for ldquocoming together of parties at Holyrood to recognise there should be a second independence referendum in the wake of the SNPrsquos election win.She said she would publish a ldquodetailed democratic case for the transfer of power to hold Indyref later in the week.She also hinted Mr Johnsonrsquos accelerated EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be the next constitutional flashpoint between Holyrood and Westminster.She saidWesminster passed it without Holyroodrsquos consent it would show ldquocontempt for devolution and a willingness to tear up constitutional rules in pursuit of Brexit.In her first address to MSPs since her party won  of the  seats last Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said: \"There is a growing, cross-party recognition that election mandates should be honoured, that there has been a material change of circumstances and that the question of independence must be decided by the people and not by politicians.\"Given the nature of what we are facing in terms of UK governance, this is now a matter of some urgency - which is why this Government wants people to have a choice next year.\":Scots can force U-turn on indyref, claims Nicola SturgeonThe First Minister said there was a similar \"coming together\" in Scotland a generation ago.She said: \"Back in the early s, when Scotland was also facing the prospect of a fourth Tory Government with no mandate here, there was a coming together of political parties, communities and civic Scotland.\"That resulted in the establishment of this Parliament. It has achieved much.\"But a new, Brexit-focused Tory Government presents risks that few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution.\"So I hope in the coming days and weeks we will see a similar coming together around the idea of Scotlands right to choose a better future.\"She said there was also a need to overcome the immediate challenges of Brexit.She said: ldquoTo that end, just as we did in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in , the Scottish government will in January convene a number of round table meetings, bringing together key groups that represent dferent aspects of Scottish le.ldquoThis will include civic society, trade unions and the business community, religious and minority groups and our partners in local government.The Scottish Government said in October that it could not recommend Holyrood consents to the Withdrawal Bill as it would result in a Brexit that did ldquosignicant damage to Scotland.Although Westminster could pass and impose the legislation without Holyroodrsquos consent, it would cause a political storm as it would be a breach of the Sewel Convention that Westminster does not ldquonormally legislate in devolved areas without Holyroodrsquos approval.Westminster has only imposed legislation in this way once before since  - when it passed the first EU Withdrawal Bill despite opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoNow it seems the Prime Minister is determined to quickly push through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.ldquoThis Parliament will have to consider whether or not it will give consent to this Bill.ldquoIf the UK Government was to press ahead without that consent it would be further proof of Westminsterrsquos contempt for devolution and its willingness to tear up established constitutional rules in its pursuit of Brexit.Ms Sturgeon also repeatedly criticised the Scottish Tories for continuing to oppose Indyref despite it being the focus of an election campaign which cost them most of their  MPs.:Boris Johnson voices fresh opposition to indyref in phone call with Nicola SturgeonShe said: ldquoThe election was comprehensively won in Scotland by the SNP. Indeed, you have to go as far back as the election of Ted Heath in  - the year I was born - to find a party that got a higher share of the vote across the UK than the SNP did in Scotland last week.ldquoThat is, by any measure, a signicant vote of confidence. It was also an endorsement of our election message - that Scotland does not want a Boris Johnson government and we donrsquot want to leave the EU and that, while opinions may dfer on the substantive question of independence, we do want Scotlandrsquos future to be in Scotlandrsquos hands.ldquoBy contrast, while the Conservative Party won a majority UK wide, they were once again heavily defeated here in Scotland, having fought the election on the single issue of opposition to an independence referendum.ldquoIn fact, the Conservatives have now lost  consecutive Westminster elections in Scotland ndash stretching back to . But in spite of that, we face a majority Tory government implementing a manesto that Scotland rejected.ldquoThis election demonstrated a fundamental point. The kind of future desired by most people in Scotland is very clearly dferent to that favored by much of the rest of the UK.ldquoIt is essential therefore that a future outside of Europe and governed by an increasingly right wing Conservative government is not foisted upon Scotland.ldquoInstead, we must have the right to consider the alternative of independence.Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said: ldquoWhat this election has confirmed beyond doubt or debate is that the whole of the United Kingdom together will be leaving the European Union at the end of next month. The campaign to stop it happening has failed, our departure is going ahead and the result of the  UK referendum will be respected.\"He added: \"Brexit is no longer a what-, it is a political reality for us all. The whole of the UK together will now enter the period of transition and leave on the basis of the future trading arrangements with our EU partners negotiated next year.\"Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoI say to Jackson Carlaw, for him to stand up in this chamber and gloat about the fact that every part of the UK will be leaving the EU together is a disgrace.ldquo It is a democratic disgrace that Scotland faces being dragged out of the European Union against our will.ldquoThat is why we should have a choice over a better future, andthe Scottish Conservatives had any respect whatsoever for democracy, thatrsquos exactly what we would have.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said his party was happy to support the Scottish Governmentrsquos demand for a seat at the table during Brexit trade negotiations.He said: ldquoWe are happy to work on a cross-party basis as we did [in the early s]. We will work on a cross-party basis to resist the attacks that Boris Johnson will wage on the people.ldquoBut there is a fundamental dference compared to .

I welcome any attempt to work on a cross-party basis to that effect, and I will reach out to anybody in this chamber who wants to do that.ldquoWhen push comes to shove, Richard Leonard is happier with a Conservative government at Westminster than self-government for Scotland.ldquoBut for all of that, the point which we should be able to unite around is this - itrsquos not for me to decide that, itrsquos not for Richard Leonard, Jackson Carlaw, or Boris Johnson to decide whether or not Scotland should become independent.ldquoIt is for the Scottish people to decide. My party has a mandate to offer that choice and I know there are many voices, which I welcome, in Scottish Labour saying that that mandate should be respected, and I think Richard Leonard should reflect very, very carefully on that point.However it also emerged Labour MSPs have been ordered to vote against the legislation paving the way for Indyref when it comes to its final stage at Holyrood on Thursday.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie was jeered by SNP MSPs for pointing out many SNP candidates tried to downplay the prospect of Indyref in the election.He said: ldquoI congratulate the First Minister on achieving % of those who voted but can I question whether all those who voted for her party voted for another independence referendum  John Nicholson failed to mention independence on his campaign leaflet setting out ldquoSNP priorities.\"Richard Thomson said lsquoA vote for me.. is not is a vote for Scottish independence and I will never, ever, try and claim it as such.rsquo\"Surely the First Minister must see that the country has had enough of the ision, that we need to learn the lessons of Brexit not repeat them with independence and she failed to persuade even half of those who voted that there should be another referendum \"Ms Sturgeon replied: \"The Conservatives and the Liberals lost the election in terms of the share of the vote and of the percentage of seats that were won by the SNP. Both are higher than what Boris Johnson got, which he is claiming is a mandate to Get Brexit done.\"Their contempt for democracy is not making those parties seem tough - it is making them seem ridiculous. The more contempt they show for Scottish democracy, the more support for Scottish independence will rise.\"Scottish SecretaryAlister Jack said:ldquoPeople in Scotland are fed up with constant ision and uncertainty. That is why we will not support the First Ministerrsquos plans for another unwanted referendum on separation.ldquoWe want  to be a year of growth and opportunity for Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom - not more political wrangling and wasteful debate.We will unleash the potential of every part of the UK and focus on the issues that matter - boosting jobs and helping with the cost of living.ldquoRemaining part of a strong United Kingdom is worth more than poundbn in public spending in Scotland each year, and through the latest spending round Scotland will receive a further pound.bn cash boost.Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie said his party was ldquomore than ready to campaign again for Scotlandrsquos future to be decided by the people who live here, and for independence to be the path that we choose. We are ready for that campaign to begin, and wersquore ready to win that campaign.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon is trying to sound reasonable, but what she is saying is anything but. ldquoThe General Election result did not provide her with a mandate for a isive and unwanted second independence referendum.ldquoMs Sturgeon has made clear that votes for the SNP in last weekrsquos election were not a vote for Scotland leaving the UK.

They had three scenarios for crude, at ,  and  per barrel. They said: ldquoDevelopment and operating expenditures are also very sensitive to the oil and gas price behaviours. Thus, at the  price case total field development expenditure over the period -  is pound. billion, while at the  price case it is poundbn.Environmentalists want the oil to stay under the sea.

The price per barrel should be measured in the climate-changing emissions it releases and destruction it brings to the most vulnerable people and places on earth.ldquoTackling the climate emergency means we must ban oil and gas exploration, and redirect the vast subsidies propping up fossil fuel extraction towards creating decent green jobs in a zero carbon economy.ldquoAll exploration should stop now, no new licences should be issued and current fields should be run down over the next decade as part of a just transition to clean energy jobs.ldquoIf you are in an emergency, the first thing to do is stop making it worse.

Itrsquos a technology the Committee on Climate Change has stated is critical and needed at scale to meet the UKrsquos world-leading climate change commitments.The full-chain Acorn project is set to be operational by the early s and is just one example of how this sector is working to find solutions to develop a lower carbon economy.: Scotlands oil boom can last another  yearsIt was Abraham Lincoln who said the best way to predict the future is to create it. From Peterhead to Southampton, the hundreds of companies which support the production of oil and gas from UK waters are changing to realise the opportunities of a more erse and lower carbon energy mix.With commercial opportunity, a societal push for faster and more effective change to reduce emissions, and government support, the foundations are in place for an energy transition. Just as the UK moved from burning wood to coal and then in the rsquos to gas, wersquore looking to a future where our needs for energy and industrial products are more erse, sustainable and efficient. The agenda-setting Committee on Climate Change report published in May showed that oil and gas currently provide  per cent of the UKrsquos total energy needs. By  we estimate this will be about a third. But what does this mean for our industry First, we know that the UK will continue to need oil and gas as part of this erse energy mix. The Scottish Government has agreed thatwe close down the North Sea without first reducing demand we would only lsquooffshorersquo even more of our emissions as we would need to increase the UKrsquos reliance on imported oil and gas.We would also lose the additional benefits of the UK industry of jobs, tax revenue and the engineering expertise that is helping transform our energy system. However, itrsquos important we produce oil and gas with ever reducing emissions. Unlike our Norwegian partners, most North Sea s arenrsquot connected to the electricity grid and produce the power they need for cooking, heating and operations through gas or diesel generators. UK companies are already in action, with some working on linking offshore renewables to oil and gas s.We know that sustainability and competitiveness are intrinsically linked. While oil price is important, efficiency and competitiveness are within the industryrsquos control and as we have been emerging from one of the toughest downturns in our history the sector has proved its ability to improve both.: Scotland must be bold to meet climate emergency targetsSecond, supporting over , UK jobs and with a world-class supply chain renowned for finding solutions to complex problems, we are an industry with skill, capability and infrastructure. OGUKrsquos Energy Transition Outlook made the case for action to progress Carbon Capture Usage and Storage , and our members are already in action in the UK and internationally to develop CCUS and hydrogen at scale.As our report also made clear, this is an industry which will need to earn its position in this new energy world. Itrsquos why earlier this year we published lsquoRoadmap : a blueprint for net zerorsquo. Itrsquos one of the first industrial responses to commitments to deliver net zero emissions by  in Scotland, and  in the UK. Setting out five areas where industry, government and regulator action is underway or is needed. It will help enable a safe and competitive industry that realises its full potential in the energy transition.Finally, we know that having a vision and a plan matter. The painful transition from coal and the fate of that industry in the UK casts a long shadow. We have a duty to reflect seriously on lessons from that change as we look to Scotland and the UKrsquos energy future.lsquoRoadmap : a blueprint for net zerorsquo, offers a compelling vision developed through over , conversations with people who work in or with our sector. Delivery of the Roadmap means that by  we are on track to be a net zero basin, reducing emissions from the production of oil and gas by increasing efficiency, and switching power from gas or diesel generators to low carbon resources.Itrsquos a future where our industry plays a key role in a erse energy mix and in developing the technologies to help heavy industries deal with their emissions. We continue to thrive at the cutting edge of technologies and innovation, carrying those skills into dferent energy sectors, and using this success, our supply chain is bringing billions into the UK through exporting its skills across the world.: Radium dump site in Dalgety Bay posts no signicant cancer riskThere is no doubt of the urgency to help find solutions. We live in a world where increasing demand for energy sits alongside the need for ever-decreasing emissions.Achieving net zero will require serious and committed collaboration and action from industries, governments, regulators and every inidual in every community, working together to find solutions instead of seeking isions. As we look to COP in Glasgow next year, we should be in no doubt that the eye of the world will be on us and we must be prepared to come to the table with deeds and not just words.

They thought that they could ignore their democratic duty to implement the result and they continued their Remain campaign in the guise of being the Parliamentary Opposition. However, the voters were not fooled. They had voted to Leave and they expected Parliament to implement their decision. Seeing the Remain MPs hindering, not helping, and seeing them drag out the process with squabbling and negativity, did not win over the electorate, but on the contrary made them resentful and impatient to see Brexit carried out. Therefore, when the Conservatives appealed to them with \"Get Brexit Done\", that proved to be a vote-winning slogan and the UK now has a large Conservative majority in Parliament.Jeremy Corbyn failed because he could not deal with the strong cohort of Remain MPs in his party. If Labour had implemented Brexit as it should have done as its democratic duty, there would have been no election and the Labour Party would not be in the disarray that it is in. Of course, there is no likelihood that the Remain faction, whether in Parliament, the Labour Party or in the media, will accept any responsibility for what has happened. They do not care that the referendum result created a democratic duty and that thwarting Brexit was a denial of democracy. Not our fault, they say. All Mr Corbyns fault. And so the hapless Mr Corbyn is left to take the blame for the ruination of Labour.I am sorry to see Labour brought so low and I am sorry to see Mr Corbyn unjustly blamed for all that has happened. Nevertheless, it is good to see that democracy has been upheld. The EU referendum in which  million people voted was the largest exercise of democracy that the UK has ever known. The decision was taken to Leave and the General Election result is in keeping with that decision.Les Reid, Edinburgh EH.WErsquoRE used to Unionists applying double standards when it comes to democracy:  per cent is a resounding mandate for the Tories to take the UKout of the EU but not enough for the SNP to ask for the Scots to have a bare choice in their future.

Even within my own circle I know several people who not only support independence but campaigned for it and will do so again yet in this General Election they voted Labour in the vain hope of stopping this right-wing Tory Government.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.AS expected, Nicola Sturgeon ramps up the rhetoric, demanding the powers to organise an early second independence referendum.However, I wonderher urgency is driven not only by the SNPs dominance in terms of seats won, but by a newly-arrived feeling of worry When Boris Johnson became Prime Minister towards the end of July, he was widely and correctly portrayed by the media generally as a man who would be struggling to control elements in his own party, let alone the wider political and economic world. He would eventually have to make an embarrassing climbdown, as the shortest-duration Prime Minister of the UK.When the election campaign itself got under way, there was much talk amongst the commentariat about a narrowing Tory lead in the polls. The best that Mr Johnson could hope for was to scrape home with a tiny majority, with major figures in the Government either being defeated or ed with wafer-thin margins, because of widespread tactical voting, hundreds of thousands of --year-oldd registering to vote, the large majority of whom would be pro-Corbyn, and so on. There seemed to be much discussion about the possibility of a minority Labour government granting the Section  order in order to draw on SNP support.Then, on the late evening of Thursday, December  was the exit poll, followed by Friday morning. That just wasnt supposed to happen.I wondera scintilla of doubt crept into Ms Sturgeons mind that,the effete posh boy, widely portrayed as a blustering, philandering buffoon, could pull off that sort of result, he might just make a success of Brexit, and damage the SNPs credibility.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.THERE will obviously be a great deal of sound and fury in the coming weeks, months and years regarding a future attempt by the SNP to overturn the result of the self-determination of the Scottish electorate through a second referendum on independence. At this early stage, it hard to see how this will turn out. At the same time, I am pleased to see that Scottish Labour is to develop its own \"constitutional offer\" to the Scottish people My view is that there should never a referendum on any subject ever again in the UK, butwe do have to have them, surely there should be a better legal framework to set out who can call them, under what circumstances, on which subjects, whether thresholds for supportare necessary or desirable, and how long should be left between referendums on the same subject.I would suggest that Scottish Labour consults with constitutional and electoral law experts to compile a draft of such a legal framework and adopt it as its own policy on this matter. Andother parties wish to sign up to it in the interests of democracy, so much the better.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.I MUST congratulate Mark Smith on his excellent article . I sincerely hope he is proved right come .In the meantime we have to endure the incessant calls for another independence referendum. My main concern is that the SNP has not to my knowledge articulated how the near pound billion black hole in Scotlands finances would be addressedwe were to become an independent country. I for one do not wish to face the prospect of large tax increases by whatever form. I recall the SNP once describing the Brexit deal as being like taking the economy blindfolded over the clf edge. As far as I am concerned, that is exactly what the SNP is doing to us with independence.Brian Douglas, Ayr.AS our new SNP MPs take their seats, I would like to congratulate them.However, I totally disagree with this democratic result. I simply do not accept it. Unionist parties received more votes. I will complain about it every day. I will campaign at every moment to overturn it.

In relation to those crowing and gloating over the UK-wide Conservative victory, I would draw attention to an old Gaelic proverb which translates: \"Therersquos meat and music here, as the fox said, running away with the bagpipes.\" And with reference to the character of the Conservative leader, Boris Johnson, and anticipating what might lie ahead for us, the proverb which come to mind is the Russian one: \"A fish rots from the head down.\"Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.THE fact that the SNP obtained \"only\"  per cent of the Scottish vote is being used by some people asit were some kind of diminution of their success in the election, or of the force of their policy statements. Given that every voter in Scotland had a choice of candidates representing at least four parties and many had five, six or even more to choose from, I would say that a party which has managed to pick up nearly as much electoral support as all the others put together has achieved a truly astonishing degree of success, and has acquired as strong a mandate as is conceivably possible.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB.IM intrigued by Ian Lakins assertionthat the six Scottish Tory MPs will have \"substantial influence\" with Boris Johnson.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

state railways, has lost tens of millions of pounds since taking over ScotRail in  and hoped to make a small profit in its revised offer.But it unsuccessfully argued that the poor performance of the Scottish economy and the extra cost of operations required a \"very signicant uplt\" in public subsidy payments, The Scotsman understands.Ministers currently pay ScotRail around £ million a year in the Scottish Governments biggest single contract.By contrast, the punctuality figure that ScotRail is measured on by ministers has been improving since summer , albeit it is more than  percentage points below target, which is not expected to be reached until .However, punctuality over the latest four-week period - traditionally poor because of fallen leaves which cause slippery rails - is the best among the same periods over the last five years.Transport minister Michael Matheson told MSPs today the extra public subsidy that would have been required for the last half of the ten-year contract from  was not justied.But Abellio UK chief Dominic Booth condemned the decision as the \"wrong choice\" and warned that further improvements were likely to be delayed.These include new, longer trains on the Glasgow to Gourock, Wemyss Bay, East Kilbride and Barrhead routes, and Edinburgh to Fe and the Borders.A planned new station at East Linton in East Lothian could be put back, along with more frequent trains on the Glasgow to Dumfries and Oban Mallaig line.An industry source told The Scotsman: \"Itrsquos clear from this news that Abellio ScotRail had bigger issues with its finances than performance.\"The business has lost tens of millions of pounds and it would be unsustainable for both Abellio and Transport Scotland to see it through its full ten-year term.\"In a message to staff, ScotRail managing director Alex Hynes said: \"The key reason given by the [Scottish] government was that, in its view, revising the current contract and carrying it on until  wouldnt provide value for money for the taxpayer.\"I know this news creates uncertainty for us all but we must remain focused on our mission.\"Theres no impact on your job or your pay.\"Almost all ScotRails , staff are expected to transfer to whoever takes over, on their current conditions, as happened when Abellio took over from First in .However, It is not clear who that might be in  because of an ongoing review of franchising by the UK Government.But Scottish ministers can now consider public as well as private sector bids, which was not the case when Abellio won the ScotRail franchise.Mr Matheson said: \"Work is already underway to examine the options open to ministers, after the current contract comes to an end.\"He said: ldquoAny changes to the level of subsidy paid by the government must deliver new benefits for passengers and taxpayers, and whilst there have been improvements in recent years, the proposed changes were not sufficient to justy additional subsidy.ldquoOf course, the Scottish Government must plan for the future of our rail services, beyond , and work is already underway to examine the options open to us in this regard.ldquoLonger term, this Government has already made clear its position that the current franchising regime, which is a matter reserved to the UK government, has failed and it is widely accepted that the rail industry, as a whole, must embrace reform.ldquoThe best way to deliver this is through the transfer of all rail powers, which would allow us to work together to find the right solution for our railways in future ndash properly integrated and fully aligned with the public interest and Scottish Government policy.Transport Scotland said the current franchise agreement required ministers and Abellio to revisit the level of government subsidy provided for the remaining five years of the contract and to determine whether additional subsidy should be paid, which is known as \"rebasing\".It said that following \"considerable analysis and careful consideration of the information provided by Abellio ScotRail\", ministers had decided the \"signicant increase in subsidy proposed would not secure delivery of commensurate benefits to passengers, communities and the economy\".It said ministers had served a \"no rebasing notice\" on Abellio ScotRail.Robert Samson, senior stakeholder manager in Scotland for passenger watchdog Transport Focus said: \"Over the next two years, passengers will expect a more punctual and reliable railway that improves passenger satisfaction as tracked by our national rail passenger survey.ldquoIt is good to see the government seeking value for money on behalf of passengers, but any change must not result in disruption for them.ldquoPassengers will judge the success of any future changes to the structure of the railway on how far it meets their priorities for improvement: more punctual and reliable services, more chance of getting a seat and better value for money.Scottish Conservatives transport spokesman Jamie Greene said: \"Pulling the rug from under the feet of the current operator will do nothing to improve performance, deliver better value for money or encourage future investment in our railways.\"There are serious questions to be asked of SNP ministers as to how they came to this conclusion and why they think this provides stability or makes financial sense to the taxpayer.\"Scottish Greens transport spokesman John Finnie said: ldquoWe welcome the decision to bring an end to the Abellio ScotRail franchise.\"Delays, cancellations and overcrowding have occurred far too often on Scotlandrsquos railways in recent years.ldquoIn light of noises coming from down south that the UK Government intends to attack hard won rail workers rights, itrsquos also vital Scottish ministers engage with trade unions at every step of the process in developing the next franchise, to ensure workersrsquo rights are at the heart of future ScotRail services and that there is no attempt to roll out driver-only operation.Scottish Labour transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: ldquoFor years Scottish Labour have campaigned to end Abelliorsquos shambolic spell in charge of Scotlandrsquos railway.\"Twice, Scottish Labour have forced votes on Abelliorsquos control of ScotRail and time and time again we have been voted down by the SNP, ably supported by the Tories.ldquoWe are glad the SNP have finally swallowed their pride and listened to what Scottish Labour has been calling for.ldquoWhat we now must know isthe Scottish Government intend to make a serious public sector bid for control of ScotRail or whether our railways will be flogged off once more to a foreign-based private company, focused only on profit.ldquoNothing less than a publicly-owned rail system will do to ensure the people of Scotland can have the cheap, efficient and reliable public transport they deserve.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson Mike Rumbles said: ldquoI very much welcome this decision to end Abelliorsquos contract. Itrsquos not up to the job.\"The Liberal Democrats have been calling for this move for some time.ldquoPassengers are sick to the back teeth of the poor service that has been provided by this company.\"Overcrowding, endless cancellations, stop skipping and delays have gone on too long.ldquoThe government must now take action to make sure that there is stronger protection for customers in the future franchise agreement.\"They also need to look carefully at including more break points in the new contract to ensure there is a much better chance to correct poor performance earlier on.\"The transport secretary cannot repeat the same mistakes.Abellio UK managing director Dominic Booth said: ldquoWe are hugely disappointed by this decision and believe itrsquos the wrong choice for Scotlandrsquos Railway and its customers.ldquoAbellio has invested more than £million in new and upgraded trains, added  per cent more seats for customers and created more than  extra jobs in Scotland since the start of the franchise in  - the biggest investment in trains and stations in over  years.ldquoOur offer to Transport Scotland would have delivered an improved service for our customers at a reduced cost to the taxpayer. ldquoWe will remain fully committed to running a safe and reliable service until the end of the contract in . \"While this decision creates unnecessary uncertainty for more than , staff and our customers, we will maintain our focus on delivering vital projects for Scotlandrsquos Railway and seeing through the delivery of signicant customer benefits until .Abellio warned that \"many projects and investments\" such as ending diesel-powered trains by  would be \"delayed or put at risk with a change in control of the ScotRail franchise\".Kevin Lindsay, Scotland organiser for train drivers union Aslef, said: lsquoWe are delighted by the decision announced today because we have argued for a long time that Abellio has been letting down passengers and staff here in Scotland.\"We also welcome the opportunity for a public service provider to bid to run the franchise in two years time\"We have been campaigning for years for the [Scottish] government to do something about the plight of passengers who use the ScotRail services provided by Abellio.\"Those of us on the front line ndash ScotRail train drivers and other railway staff ndash can see every day how the company comes up short.lsquoBut we are disappointed that the SNP government has not grasped the real problem - and the solution to that problem - and simply taken this opportunity to bring Scotlands railway back into public ownership.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter.

The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2485-Kylerhea-landslip.jpg","title":"skye visitors cooking class on the back burner following kylerhea","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineDaniela Celant left her holiday home in Kylerhea to drive to Kinloch Lodge earlier this afternoon to take part in a cooking class with top chef Marcello Tully.

One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do.

The letters relate to the Graham family from Owenreagh, Draperstown and Mr Mawhinney spent many years researching before compiling the  page project.Since publication the book has received many favourable reviews from around the world including one lady from from Buffalo in the USA.Janice Feigenbaum commented in personal correspondence: All I can say is WOW!! What an impressive amount of time, energy, dedication and devotion! As a fellow historian, I know how much effort was expended by you in finding the letters, reading them, compiling them, making sense of them and then weaving them cohesively into such a wonderful text.The launch event was held in The Shepherd’s Rest, Sixtowns and the compiler would offer sincere thanks to Colin Doyle for hosting the evening and to all who attended for supporting this worthwhile charity so generously. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The neighbourly gathering bringing together the Cromore Beatles, Gerry Cassidy, Barry Donaghy and Didi Semple- who both played their own set and backed golden-voiced Anne Tracey all to warm applause.

Damian Gorman is a quietly compelling performance poet and his rendering of his poignant autobiographical poem ”The Giant Basket” touched hearts in An Cro Mor. Undoubtedly though the evening’s youngest performer Caitlin Browne was the star of the night. The audience hollered their appreciation after her lively reading. Her father Jim in the audience was a proud and delighted man.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Early goals from Niall McGonagle and Rian McCormick gave Claudy the perfect start after five minutes. Downpatrick replied with a Dara OShea goal in a crowded penalty area and with Rian Burns adding another goal on one of his many forays from wing-back, De La Salle were in control. Adam Murphy was in fine form at midfield for the winners as they dug themselves back into contention but trailed - to - at the interval. It couldve been more, but Downpatrick had a third goal disallowed for square ball. googletag.cmd.push Brian Raineys men were the better team overall. With Niall McGonagle playing anywhere from centre-back to full-forward, they had a leader. In Tiarnan OConnor, they had the perfect inside forward with his movement and vision. Tiarnan OConnor scored- for Claudy. Two fortunate goals from midfielders Murphy and Oisin Kearns-Madden early in the second-half turned the game. Downpatrick replied when James Crangle bagged a goal from the rebound after his penalty was acrobatically saved by Claudy goalkeeper Cahir Melaugh. Led by Oran Carton and Ben Cooke, Claudys defence then shut up shop with a determination that meant there was only ever going to be one winner. googletag.cmd.push Downpatrick lost Nathan Kelly on a second booking and with Tiarnan OConnor and substitute Niall Barr linking well in attack, Claudy advanced to the final. POLL: Who was your man of the match  They now face the winners of the second semi-final between Castleblayney College and St Clares Ballyjamesduff. Recently retired Monaghan star Vinny Corey was among those in attendance and will have a handle on what Claudy have to offer. He will have saw Niall McGonagle limp off with a heavily strapped leg. The Dungiven man now faces a fitness battle over the Christmas holidays ahead of the final. For a full report, grab a copy of next weeks County Derry Post, in shops on Monday, December .

In their third final in succession, the Buncrana Road school - managed by Bliadhan Glass and Gearailt Oacute Mianaacutein - came from four points down to take the honours, thanks to two goals from Adam Rankin. A number of their players turned in good performances well led by Michael Lynch at centre-half back. Michael and Ronan Moore in the full-back line, Padhraig Nelis, Adam Rankin and Donegal under-age star Conor Gartland up front all shone. googletag.cmd.push Although Conor Gartland opened the scoring with a point, St Malachy’s enjoyed most of the possession over the next  minutes and three points inside two minutes from Niall O’Connor, Conor McNicholl and Anthony McGarrigle put them - to - up. O’Connor andConn MacFarlane added points before the key score of the half, a breakaway goal from St Columb’s with Adam Rankin pulling on a through ball that Bailey Graham half saved but the sliotar slipped over the line. Jude Oacuteg Moore added a point and the Derry side had something to hang on to going into the break, despite Michael Devenny striking a goal for St Malachy’s who led - to - at the turnover. googletag.cmd.push During the first  minutes of the second half, St Columb’s drew level with points from their captain Michael Lynch , Jude oacuteg Moore and Conor Gartland. Then as he had done in the first half, Adam Rankin got on the end of a move down the right wing and he flashed a shot to the top corner. Lynch and Martin added points and St Columb’s looked to be safe. However they spent the last quarter in their own half defending stubbornly and could not add to their total. Signicantly however their defence locked in well and only conceded a point from a free scored by Niall O’Connor as the Shield went to the Buncrana Road for the first time. St Columb’s: O Duddy, C McClean, M Moore, R Moore, A Meehan. M Lynch , O O’Kane, K O’Kane, A Cutlfe, P Neillis, A Rankin , J Oacuteg Moore , T Martin , C Gartland , A Breslin St Malachy’s: B Graham,O Smyth, O Kennedy, C McCann, R McCloskey, D Maguire, L O’Connor, N O’Connor , E McCartan, C MacFarlane , C McNicholl , D Turley, M Devenny , M Branf, A McGarrigle .Subs: C Morgan, R Eager, M Oacuteg Dunne.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Luckily these people are musical experts and are all too willing to share their fountains of knowledge, making for heart-warming scenes that inspire happy endings for films. I can hear you scrambling for your hats and scarves already, but slow down. Before you get distracted by whatever nonsense the council have paid someone that hasn’t got the first the idea what’s going on in this town to entertain you, let your uncle Kev guide you through the unmissable events occurring round this festive season. After a serious round of promotion for their first album, Phillip J Wallace and Oisin Cannon are readying their follow up. They’ve given hints live of rfier times ahead and their last single “Beatz Ahoy” and the word on the street is there’ll be a new album sometime soon. Armed with some of the finest tunes, weirdest set up and best delivery Waldorf  Cannon play Bennigans on Monday, December  with Teknopeasantand me firing out a lock of tunes in between times.They released their debut album this year and have played some of the more well attended gigs in the town and Jeanette and Noella Hutton have shown every band in town what a heap of fantastic tunes can done. Never mind the pointless online hoods, these two really do let the music do the talking and their quirky shows take things off the beaten track. Their album launch in the Sandwich Co was one of the biggest gigs in the town this year and Blood play Gwyn’s Cafeacute in Brooke Park on Boxing Night, it’s an early one and doors are at .pm and there’s a strict .pm curfew, it’s a bring your own booze event and access is only through the Creggan Hill gate.Also, that night, Red Organ Serpent Sound play the Nerve Centre with Dirty Faces and Foreign Owl. This is the third home gig of the season for arguably one of the most exciting live acts around. Following up the rammed Nerve Centre reunion gig with a Bonfire Night Gasyard gig Red Organ Serpent Sound only do thing big, with every note designed to land directly in your face the five piece will again take the roof off the Nerve Centre. Following the release of their second album demos before their first album has been released has highlighted the fact that this is not a band that does the expected, live they’re something  altogether and you can expect…what did I tell you about expectation  Tickets are pound and probably won’t last.Anywhere  in the world Balkan gypsy folk music might seem a little out of place and the talents of the Balkan Alien Sound Orchestra might go unheard. In true Derry tradition they shortened the name and on Sunday, December , Basork will be playing upstairs in Tinney’s. They’ve had a single out this year and their Martyhas been over in Bulgaria showing themmins his stuff and letting them show him a thing or two, he’s a good egg like that. The band are launching their single at the oddest time of year but такъв е животът as they say in Bulgaria. They’ll be playing with Duozouk and Paul Brown will be playing tunes from all the corners of the globe, doors are at  and tickets are …. punts.I know I swore that that was it for the gigs and all, but Dutch Kills will also be coming out of semi-retirement for a secret special gig inside Bennigans, I’ll announce it next week. But that’s pretty much it. All the above will be peddling their wares and you’ll be able to pick yourself up a cd, record or t-shirt and support an artist for the year ahead. And THAT is the important lesson to learn this Christmas, not the redemption of Ebenezer Scrooge or George Bailey and the angels, no it’s that people who make their living from their art and music do it by being supported all year round. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town. While the post offices are important to our major towns, many are also at the heart of rural communities across the district.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after. This was the last time she was home..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Sophie.jpg","title":"Teenager Sophie fundraising for blind charity  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager has embarked upon a fundraising initiative on behalf of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.Sophie Millswill be selling raffle tickets for a host of prizes over the coming weeks ahead of a a key fundraising event in Ballynahinch Masonic Hall on February  next year.The Year  Ballynahinch High School student mdash who has been diagnosed with Albinism mdash is on the waiting list for a guide dog and has already been cane-trained by representatives from the charity.The teenager, who relies on the aid of her cane, is hoping that she will get her guide dog sometime next year, but is conscious that there is a long waiting list.Sophie, who recently finished in the top six of a SuperValu Superstars competition and was presented with a certicate during a glittering awards night at Belfastrsquos Titanic Hotel, is keen to help the Guide Dogs charity by raising money on its behalf.Her mum Marina said the estimated cost of training a guide dog is pound,.She explained: ldquoSophie wants to raise as much money as she can to help the charity which does not receive any government funding.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
